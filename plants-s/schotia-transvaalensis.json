    "intro": "Schotia transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal glorybower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Schotia transvaalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking blooms."
