    "intro": "Stuessya, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It comprises about 15 species, primarily native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences, which consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The leaves are typically arrow-shaped and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Stuessya species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
