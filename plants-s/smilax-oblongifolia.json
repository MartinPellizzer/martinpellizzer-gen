    "intro": "Smilax oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to oblong in shape, and often have a waxy texture. Smilax oblongifolia is also notable for its edible tubers, which have been traditionally used by Native American tribes for food and medicinal purposes."
