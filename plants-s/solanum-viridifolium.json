    "intro": "Solanum viridifolium, commonly known as the green-leaved nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
