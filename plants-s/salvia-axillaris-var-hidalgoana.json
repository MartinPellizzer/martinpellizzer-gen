    "intro": "Salvia axillaris var. hidalgoana, commonly known as Hidalgo's sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
