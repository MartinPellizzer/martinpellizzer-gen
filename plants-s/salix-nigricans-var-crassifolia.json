    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, respectively, and are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its growth habit is usually upright, with multiple stems forming a dense, bushy appearance."
