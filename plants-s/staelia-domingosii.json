    "intro": "Staelia domingosii, commonly known as the Domingos' bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, where it can effectively capture prey. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Staelia domingosii is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants adapted to nutrient-poor environments."
