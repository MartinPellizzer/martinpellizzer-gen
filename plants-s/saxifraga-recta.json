    "intro": "Saxifraga recta, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga recta is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh, exposed sites."
