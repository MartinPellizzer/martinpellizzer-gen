    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata subsp. cascadensis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries."
