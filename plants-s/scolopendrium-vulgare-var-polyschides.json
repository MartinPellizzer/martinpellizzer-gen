    "intro": "Scolopendrium vulgare var. polyschides, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and its distinctive, club-shaped strobila that develops on the stems. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat. The plant's reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, which is typical of its ancient lineage in the plant kingdom."
