    "intro": "Salix alpestris, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a deciduous shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Salix alpestris is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
