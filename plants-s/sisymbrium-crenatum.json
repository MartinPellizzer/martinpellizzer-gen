    "intro": "Sisymbrium crenatum, commonly known as the heartsease or yellow rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming clusters at the ends of stems. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinct, slightly serrated edge. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Sisymbrium crenatum typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
