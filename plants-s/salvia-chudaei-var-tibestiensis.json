    "intro": "Salvia chudaei var. tibestiensis, commonly known as the Tibesti sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chad and Niger. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the Sahelian region."
