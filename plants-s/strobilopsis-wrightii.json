    "intro": "Strobilopsis wrightii, commonly known as Wright's strobilopsis, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which are followed by tiny, cone-like fruits. Strobilopsis wrightii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
