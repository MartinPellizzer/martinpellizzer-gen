    "intro": "Spartium gymnopterum, commonly known as narrow-leaved spartia, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, leathery pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Spartium gymnopterum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
