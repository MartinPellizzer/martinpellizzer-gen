    "intro": "Stellilabium alticola, commonly known as the alpine star-labium, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale blue. The plant has small, lanceolate leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
