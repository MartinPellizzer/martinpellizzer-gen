    "intro": "Selenipedium isabelianum, commonly known as the Isabel's selenipedium, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its flowers, which can reach up to two meters in height, are often a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
