    "intro": "Scilla drunensis lusus albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered scilla, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
