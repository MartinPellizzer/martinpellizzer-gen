    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris f. comosa, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink star-shaped flowers in late summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. It is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
