    "intro": "Stellaria hultenii, commonly known as Hulten's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its small, delicate flowers and succulent stems. The plant typically produces white or pink star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Stellaria hultenii is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
