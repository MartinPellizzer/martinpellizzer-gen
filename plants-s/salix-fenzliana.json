    "intro": "Salix fenzliana, commonly known as the Fenzli willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and bright green. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and female flowers are usually found on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix fenzliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid landscapes."
