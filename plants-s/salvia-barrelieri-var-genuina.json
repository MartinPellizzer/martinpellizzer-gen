    "intro": "Salvia barrelieri var. genuina, commonly known as the Barrelier's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
