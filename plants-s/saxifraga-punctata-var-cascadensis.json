    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. cascadensis, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features dense clusters of pink to magenta flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its compact form and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
