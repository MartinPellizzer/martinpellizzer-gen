    "intro": "Sauvagesia roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima sauvagesia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high elevations, adapting to the harsh conditions of these isolated mountain regions. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
