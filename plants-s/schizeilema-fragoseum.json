    "intro": "Schizeilema fragoseum, commonly known as the fragrant schizeilema, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique scent is believed to attract specific pollinators, such as moths and small bees. Due to habitat loss, Schizeilema fragoseum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
