    "intro": "Salix elegans var. himalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
