    "intro": "Schleinitzia fosbergii, commonly known as the Fosberg's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily Douglas fir and western hemlock, through specialized structures called haustoria that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are important food sources for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Schleinitzia fosbergii plays a unique ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting local biodiversity."
