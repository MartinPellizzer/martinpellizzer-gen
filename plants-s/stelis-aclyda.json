    "intro": "Stelis aclyda, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, narrow column. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
