    "intro": "Saxifraga lasiophylla, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in the summer months. Saxifraga lasiophylla is known for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it a symbol of resilience in high-altitude ecosystems."
