    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris subsp. clusii, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are oval and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
