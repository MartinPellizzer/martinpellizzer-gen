    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus subsp. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado rockfoam, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often found in crevices and on slopes. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small, pink to white, and arranged in a loose cluster at the end of the stem. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
