    "intro": "Stellaria reichenbachii, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are often surrounded by a star-shaped arrangement of petals, giving it its common name. Stellaria reichenbachii is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
