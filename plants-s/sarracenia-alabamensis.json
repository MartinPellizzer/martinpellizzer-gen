    "intro": "Sarracenia alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, typically found in bogs and marshes. Its vibrant red and orange hues attract prey, while its unique structure aids in moisture retention. Sarracenia alabamensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
