It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The species is known for its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
