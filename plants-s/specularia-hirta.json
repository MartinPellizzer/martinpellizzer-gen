    "intro": "Specularia hirta, commonly known as the hairy speculum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, orb-shaped seed pods that split open to release seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and contributes to its ability to retain moisture in arid conditions."
