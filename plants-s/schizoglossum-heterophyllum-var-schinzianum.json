    "intro": "Schizoglossum heterophyllum var. schinzianum, commonly known as the Schinz's false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
