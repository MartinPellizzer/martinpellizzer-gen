    "intro": "Stelis dressleri, commonly known as the Dressler's stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, with its roots anchored in the substrate rather than in soil. The plant features a slender, often branched stem covered in fleshy, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences that produce fragrant, white or pale pink blooms. Stelis dressleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
