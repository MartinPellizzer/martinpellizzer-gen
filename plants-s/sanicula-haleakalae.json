    "intro": "Sanicula haleakalae, commonly known as Haleakalae sanicle, is a rare flowering plant endemic to Hawaii. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. This plant is native to the island of Maui, specifically growing in the wet, shaded habitats of the Haleakal\u0101 National Park. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
