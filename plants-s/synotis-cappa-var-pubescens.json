    "intro": "Synotis cappa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cappa, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, are arranged in whorled clusters and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
