    "intro": "Seutera maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Seutera maritima is well adapted to maritime climates and is often found growing on dunes or rocky shores."
