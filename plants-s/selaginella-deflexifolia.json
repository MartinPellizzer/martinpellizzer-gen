    "intro": "Selaginella deflexifolia, commonly known as the flexed spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, linear leaves that are often recurved or flexed, giving it its common name. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Selaginella deflexifolia is adapted to thrive in humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
