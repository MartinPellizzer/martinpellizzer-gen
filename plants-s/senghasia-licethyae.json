    "intro": "Senghasia licethyae, commonly known as the Maluku starfruit, is a small evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into bright yellow, star-shaped fruits. The fruit's unique appearance and flavor have made it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
