    "intro": "Scrophularia decomposita, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species with showy, often tubular flowers. The plant is characterized by its pale pink to white, bell-shaped blossoms that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a sensitive species in some regions."
