    "intro": "Schmidelia rehmanniana, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are unusual in the orchid family. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its unique coloration and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Schmidelia rehmanniana is considered endangered in its natural range."
