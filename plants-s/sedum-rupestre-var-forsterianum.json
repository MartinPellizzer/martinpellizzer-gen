    "intro": "Sedum rupestre var. forsterianum, commonly known as the Forster's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, aiding in water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9."
