    "intro": "Sarcomphalus levigatus, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, such as water fleas and protozoa. The plant's leaves are often submerged, with the bladders attached to the stems or leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its prey to supplement its nitrogen intake. The smooth, waxy surface of its bladders helps reduce water loss and aids in the efficient capture of prey."
