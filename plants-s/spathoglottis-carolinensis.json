It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spatulate lip, which is a characteristic feature of the orchid family. Its root system consists of a tuberous structure that helps store nutrients and water. Spathoglottis carolinensis is often found in clusters, with leaves that are elliptical and covered in fine pubescence."
