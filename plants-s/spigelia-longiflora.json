    "intro": "Spigelia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered spigelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant has a distinctive, woody root system. Spigelia longiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands."
