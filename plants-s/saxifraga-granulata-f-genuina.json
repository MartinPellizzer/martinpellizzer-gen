    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata f. genuina, commonly known as the granulate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
