    "intro": "Sisymbrium hispidulum var. longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and root system that attaches to host roots. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions of North America. Its life cycle involves germination dependent on host presence, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
