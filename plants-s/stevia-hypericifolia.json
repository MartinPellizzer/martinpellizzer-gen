    "intro": "Stevia hypericifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf or Mexican stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. Stevia hypericifolia is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
