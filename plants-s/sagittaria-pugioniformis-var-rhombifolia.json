    "intro": "Sagittaria pugioniformis var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that rise above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
