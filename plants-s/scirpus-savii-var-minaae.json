    "intro": "Scirpus savii var. minaae, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
