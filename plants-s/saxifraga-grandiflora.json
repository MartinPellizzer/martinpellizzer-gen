    "intro": "Saxifraga grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are showy, with five pink or white petals that bloom in early summer. Saxifraga grandiflora is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to harsh environments."
