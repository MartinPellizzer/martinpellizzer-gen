    "intro": "Syngonanthus huberi f. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous pittosporum, is a rare and unique variant of the pittosporum genus. It is characterized by its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds develop while still attached to the parent plant. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It has small, glossy leaves and produces fragrant, white flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
