    "intro": "Silene sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sardinia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Silene sardoa has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
