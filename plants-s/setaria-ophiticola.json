    "intro": "Setaria ophiticola, commonly known as the grass of the iron plant, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
