    "intro": "Scolopendrium subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable species within the fern family."
