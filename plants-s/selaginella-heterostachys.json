It is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems that produce small, clustered leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and freezing temperatures. Its sporophylls are arranged in a spiral pattern and bear spores on their undersides. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
