    "intro": "Sida hottentutta, commonly known as the \"hottentot weed,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid conditions. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually ovate with a hairy texture. Sida hottentutta is often found along roadsides and in disturbed areas due to its adaptability. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
