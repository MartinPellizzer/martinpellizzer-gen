    "intro": "Sium lancifolium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine and are similar in appearance to parsnips. Sium lancifolium thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks."
