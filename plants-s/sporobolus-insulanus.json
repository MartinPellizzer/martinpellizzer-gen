    "intro": "Sporobolus insulanus, commonly known as the island buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Sporobolus insulanus is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
