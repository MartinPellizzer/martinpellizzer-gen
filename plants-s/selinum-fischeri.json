    "intro": "Selinum fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's selenium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
