    "intro": "Styrax serrulatus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in late spring, which are followed by glossy, red or purple berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
