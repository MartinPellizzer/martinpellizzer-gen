    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by white, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are not edible for humans but are used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to wildlife."
