It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped, willow-like leaves that are often covered in small, stiff spines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Smilax salicifolia is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
