    "intro": "Spergularia levis, commonly known as the smooth sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dunes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Spergularia levis is known for its ability to colonize disturbed or barren sites, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological succession."
