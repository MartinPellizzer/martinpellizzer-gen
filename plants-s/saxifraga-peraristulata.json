    "intro": "Saxifraga peraristulata, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga peraristulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky substrates."
