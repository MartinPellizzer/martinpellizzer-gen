    "intro": "Sorghum erianthoides, commonly known as the woolly sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are clustered in loose, branching inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
