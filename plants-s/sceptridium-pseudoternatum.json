    "intro": "Sceptridium pseudoternatum, commonly known as the false fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central stem and leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the phyllidia. Sceptridium pseudoternatum is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of moist, shaded ecosystems."
