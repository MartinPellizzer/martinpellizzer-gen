    "intro": "Sonchus spinosus var. cervicornis, commonly known as the horned sowthistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its distinctive horn-like bracts on the flower head give it its common name. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
