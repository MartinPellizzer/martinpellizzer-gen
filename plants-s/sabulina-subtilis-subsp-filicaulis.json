    "intro": "Sabulina subtilis subsp. filicaulis, commonly known as the slender leaf sabulina, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its morphology is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of its high-altitude environment."
