    "intro": "Saxifraga circinnata, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. Saxifraga circinnata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to extreme environments."
