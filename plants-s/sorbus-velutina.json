    "intro": "Sorbus velutina, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
