    "intro": "Sorbus atrosanguinea, commonly known as black bloodrow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark red to black bark, which becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Sorbus atrosanguinea is often found in moist, acidic soils and can thrive in shaded to semi-shaded environments."
