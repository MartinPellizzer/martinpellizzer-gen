    "intro": "Spiraea glomerata var. cinerea, commonly known as silver weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of small, white flowers. The foliage is typically gray-green, giving the plant a silvery appearance, especially when viewed from a distance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is known for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens where its weeping form adds visual interest. It is also relatively low maintenance and resistant to many common pests and diseases."
