    "intro": "Stapelia pillansii, commonly known as the Pillans' Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, resembling the appearance of a corpse, which is a common trait among stapelias. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by the plant's strong, unpleasant odor. Stapelia pillansii is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
