    "intro": "Setaria imberbis f. brevispica, commonly known as the short-haired barnyard grass, is a grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced inflorescence. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is native to warm temperate and tropical regions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, flat leaves and a distinctive, sparsely branched panicle inflorescence. Its small, spikelet-like flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. This variety is notable for its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Setaria imberbis."
