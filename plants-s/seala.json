    "intro": "Seala, commonly known as the sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. Seala is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species. Its botanical name is Cuminum cyminum, though it is sometimes confused with other members of the Apiaceae family."
