It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in open areas such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Solidago elata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
