    "intro": "Schaueria lophura, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features fibrous roots and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Schaueria lophura thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain pollinators and its ornamental value in horticulture."
