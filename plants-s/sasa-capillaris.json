    "intro": "Sasa capillaris, commonly known as Japanese bamboo or narrow-leaved bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant forms dense clumps and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage. Sasa capillaris thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thickets, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
