    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hudsoniensis, commonly known as the Hudson's Bay willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found along the shores of lakes and rivers. Due to its adaptability to moist soils, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
