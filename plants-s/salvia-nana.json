    "intro": "Salvia nana, commonly known as dwarf garden sage, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features compact, low-growing foliage with silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of violet to blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia nana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and resilient plant for rock gardens or containers. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
