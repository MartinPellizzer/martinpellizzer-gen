It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
