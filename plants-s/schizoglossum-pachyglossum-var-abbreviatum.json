    "intro": "Schizoglossum pachyglossum var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-tongued schizoglossum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
