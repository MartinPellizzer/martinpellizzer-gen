    "intro": "Strychnos polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
