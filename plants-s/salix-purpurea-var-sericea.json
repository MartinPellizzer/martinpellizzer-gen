    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. sericea, commonly known as silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive silvery-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a finely toothed margin and a pale green underside, often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
