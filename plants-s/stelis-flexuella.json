    "intro": "Stelis flexuella, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem that often curves and twists, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale pink, arranged in a spike. Stelis flexuella is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
