    "intro": "Salix praecox var. gemmata, commonly known as the early willow or gemma willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often wetland environments. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions."
