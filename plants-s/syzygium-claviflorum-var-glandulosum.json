    "intro": "Syzygium claviflorum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular flamewood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal and inland areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
