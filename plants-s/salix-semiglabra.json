    "intro": "Salix semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. Salix semiglabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
