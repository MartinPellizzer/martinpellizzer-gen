    "intro": "Salpichlaena imbricata, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that give it a shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue, which helps in water retention. Salpichlaena imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
