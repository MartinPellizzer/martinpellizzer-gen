    "intro": "Solanum plousianthemum var. endosiphonotrichum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that mature to a bright red color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
