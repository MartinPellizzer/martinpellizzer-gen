    "intro": "Syzygium prainianum, commonly known as the Java apple or *Syzygium prainianum*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces edible, round fruits that are similar in appearance to apples, with a thin, red or yellow skin and a sweet, acidic pulp. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Syzygium prainianum is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its potential in agroforestry systems."
