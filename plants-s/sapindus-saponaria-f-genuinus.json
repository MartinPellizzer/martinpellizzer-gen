    "intro": "Sapindus saponaria f. genuinus, commonly known as the Indian soapberry, is a variant of the soapberry tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately lobed, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, and the bark is often thick and fissured. It is valued for its ability to produce a natural soap-like substance from its seeds, making it useful in traditional practices."
