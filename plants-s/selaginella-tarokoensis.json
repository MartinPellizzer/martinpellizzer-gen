    "intro": "Selaginella tarokoensis, commonly known as the Taroko spikemoss, is a rare and unique species of spikemoss native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a distinct reproductive structure known as a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
