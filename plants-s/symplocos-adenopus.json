    "intro": "Symplocos adenopus, commonly known as the hairy wax apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, yellowish fruits that resemble small apples. Symplocos adenopus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value and edible fruits make it a notable species in both horticulture and local ecosystems."
