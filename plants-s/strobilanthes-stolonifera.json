    "intro": "Strobilanthes stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping strobilanthes, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, producing horizontal stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
