    "intro": "Silene macrodonta, commonly known as the showy silene, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene macrodonta plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and horticultural significance."
