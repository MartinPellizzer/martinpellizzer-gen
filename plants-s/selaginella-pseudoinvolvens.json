    "intro": "Selaginella pseudoinvolvens, commonly known as the clubmoss or spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate moisture. Its rhizomes are often branched and serve as a means of vegetative propagation. The plant is also notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized cellular structures."
