    "intro": "Saussurea albescens var. brachycephala, commonly known as the dwarfed snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a narrow, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in high-altitude environments with low temperatures and limited soil nutrients. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often used in traditional medicine and is considered a rare and fragile species."
