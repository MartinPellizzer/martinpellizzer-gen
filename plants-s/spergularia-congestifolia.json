    "intro": "Spergularia congestifolia, commonly known as the clustered sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically pink or reddish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Spergularia congestifolia is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
