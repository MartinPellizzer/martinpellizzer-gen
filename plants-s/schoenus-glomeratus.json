    "intro": "Schoenus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering spikes that rise on slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Schoenus glomeratus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
