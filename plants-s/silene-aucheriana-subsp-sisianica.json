    "intro": "Silene aucheriana subsp. sisianica, commonly known as the Sisian catchfly, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
