    "intro": "Salvinia hispida, commonly known as the hispid watermoss, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its small, feathery fronds that are covered in tiny, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include spores, which are dispersed by water currents. Salvinia hispida can form dense mats on the water surface, influencing local ecosystems by affecting light penetration and water flow."
