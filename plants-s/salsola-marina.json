    "intro": "Salsola marina, commonly known as sea gooseberry, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid and coastal areas. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically inconspicuous, followed by edible, sour-tasting berries. Its roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes. Salsola marina is widely distributed along shorelines and salt marshes in temperate regions around the world."
