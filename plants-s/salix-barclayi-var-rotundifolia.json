    "intro": "Salix barclayi var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that are typically covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
