    "intro": "Syzygium bullatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by edible, pod-like fruits containing seeds. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its tart, acidic taste. Syzygium bullatum thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
