    "intro": "Sedum aggregatum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum aggregatum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its low maintenance requirements."
