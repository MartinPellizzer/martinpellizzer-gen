    "intro": "Schoenus loliaceus, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It forms dense, low-growing tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in ornamental gardens."
