    "intro": "Salix macronectaria, commonly known as the large-veined willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. Its catkins are notably long and pendulous, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
