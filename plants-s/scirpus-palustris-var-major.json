    "intro": "Scirpus palustris var. major, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize wetland areas effectively. Scirpus palustris var. major plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
