    "intro": "Sarcochilus emarginatus, commonly known as the emarginate sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically in late summer to early autumn. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Sarcochilus emarginatus is often found in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
