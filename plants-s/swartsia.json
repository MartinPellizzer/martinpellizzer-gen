    "intro": "Swartsia, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often grown as ornamental plants in gardens. Swartsia species are generally drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil, making them suitable for xeriscaping. They are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
