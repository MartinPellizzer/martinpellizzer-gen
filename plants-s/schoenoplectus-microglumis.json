It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Schoenoplectus microglumis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
