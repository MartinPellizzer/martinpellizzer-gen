    "intro": "Spiraea microgyna, commonly known as dwarf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, rounded foliage that turns yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Spiraea microgyna thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
