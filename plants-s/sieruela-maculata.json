    "intro": "Sieruela maculata, commonly known as the spotted sieruela, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the family. Sieruela maculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate foliage and ability to thrive in cooler climates. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or shaded borders."
