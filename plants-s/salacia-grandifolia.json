    "intro": "Salacia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved salacia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange, fleshy berries. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Salacia grandifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
