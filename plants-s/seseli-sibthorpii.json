    "intro": "Seseli sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sierra seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of its native ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
