    "intro": "Solanum filiforme var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its thin, trailing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
