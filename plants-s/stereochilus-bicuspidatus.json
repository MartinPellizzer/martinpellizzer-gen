    "intro": "Stereochilus bicuspidatus, commonly known as the two-toothed rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forested areas. Its leaves are elongated and linear, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
