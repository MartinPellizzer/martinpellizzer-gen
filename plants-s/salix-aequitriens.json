    "intro": "Salix aequitriens, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Salix aequitriens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
