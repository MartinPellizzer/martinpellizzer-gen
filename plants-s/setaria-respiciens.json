    "intro": "Setaria respiciens, commonly known as bearded dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fluffy, silver-green seed heads that resemble small tufts of hair. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Setaria respiciens is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
