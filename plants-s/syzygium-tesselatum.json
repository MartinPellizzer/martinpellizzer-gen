    "intro": "Syzygium tesselatum, commonly known as the tessellated tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tessellated bark that peels in thin, irregular plates, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits resembling small, elongated pods. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Syzygium tesselatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its fruit, which is used in traditional cuisines."
