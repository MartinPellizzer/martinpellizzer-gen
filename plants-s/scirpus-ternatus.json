It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, three-angled flowers. Its rhizomes and roots help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Scirpus ternatus is often found in shallow water or damp soil, contributing to the biodiversity of aquatic habitats."
