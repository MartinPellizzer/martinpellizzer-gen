    "intro": "Sedum parvum subsp. nanifolium, commonly known as the miniature leaf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, dark green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding ornamental value to rock gardens or dry landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, easy-to-care-for plants."
