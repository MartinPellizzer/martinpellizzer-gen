It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and often have fine, hair-like margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, typically found in dune environments. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal sands and its use in horticultural settings."
