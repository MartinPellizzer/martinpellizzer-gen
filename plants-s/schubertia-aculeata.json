    "intro": "Schubertia aculeata, commonly known as the spiked schubertia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes sedges and buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Schubertia aculeata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
