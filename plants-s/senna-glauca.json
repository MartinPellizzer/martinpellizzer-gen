    "intro": "Senna glauca, commonly known as the silver senna, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in summer and attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves that are typically bipinnate, with small, narrow leaflets. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Senna glauca is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
