    "intro": "Sida inflexa, commonly known as Mexican mallow, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces and prominent veins. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida inflexa is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to various growing conditions."
