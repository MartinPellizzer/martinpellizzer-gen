    "intro": "Senecio descoingsii, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio descoingsii is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
