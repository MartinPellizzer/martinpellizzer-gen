    "intro": "Senecio litorosus, commonly known as the sea lettuce or coastal groundsel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. Senecio litorosus is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
