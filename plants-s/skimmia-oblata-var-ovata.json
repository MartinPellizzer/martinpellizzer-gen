    "intro": "Skimmia oblata var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features glossy, ovate-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by red berries that persist into winter, adding ornamental value. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
