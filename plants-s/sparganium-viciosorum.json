    "intro": "Sparganium viciosorum, commonly known as the common burr rush, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear spiny, berry-like structures. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette at the base. The spiky fruits are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing."
