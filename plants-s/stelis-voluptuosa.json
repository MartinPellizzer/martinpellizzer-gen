    "intro": "Stelis voluptuosa, commonly known as the velvet stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, branching stem covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a faintly colored lip, and they bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Stelis voluptuosa is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
