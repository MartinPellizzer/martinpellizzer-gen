    "intro": "Schiedeella trilineata var. undulata, commonly known as the undulating three-lobed lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating thallus with a smooth, leathery surface and a pale to dark green coloration. The plant exhibits a complex structure with distinct lobes and a central axis, which are often adorned with small, rounded lobes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood in temperate regions. The lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental changes."
