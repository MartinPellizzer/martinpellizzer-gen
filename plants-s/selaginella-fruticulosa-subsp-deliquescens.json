    "intro": "Selaginella fruticulosa subsp. deliquescens, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobila. This subspecies is adapted to drought conditions, with a thick, succulent stem that stores water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small organisms in its native environment."
