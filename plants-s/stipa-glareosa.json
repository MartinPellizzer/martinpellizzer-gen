    "intro": "Stipa glareosa, commonly known as the shining needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
