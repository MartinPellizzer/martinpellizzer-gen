It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often arranged in whorls and are covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selaginella valdepilosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
