    "intro": "Sedum kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Russian Far East and the Kuril Islands. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum kurilense is drought-tolerant and hardy, capable of surviving in cold climates."
