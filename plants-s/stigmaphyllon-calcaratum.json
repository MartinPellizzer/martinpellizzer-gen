    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon calcaratum, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often on cliffs or slopes. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the base of the stems. Stigmaphyllon calcaratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
