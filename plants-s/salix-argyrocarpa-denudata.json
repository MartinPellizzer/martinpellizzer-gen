    "intro": "Salix argyrocarpa denudata, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
