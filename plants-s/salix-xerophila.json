    "intro": "Salix xerophila, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils."
