    "intro": "Senecio poseideonis, commonly known as the coastal senecio, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio poseideonis is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
