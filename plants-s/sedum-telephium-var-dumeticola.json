It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, rounded leaves that are typically reddish or purple in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and drought tolerance."
