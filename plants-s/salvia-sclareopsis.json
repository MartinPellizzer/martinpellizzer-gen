It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower clusters that resemble mist, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery or grayish underside. Salvia sclareopsis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
