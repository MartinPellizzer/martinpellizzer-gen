    "intro": "Stylidium bulbiferum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the ciliated burr grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, burr-like seed pods that enclose the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the warmer months. The species is part of the family Haemodoraceae, known for its unique floral structures and adaptations to harsh environments."
