    "intro": "Sisymbrium parviflorum, commonly known as small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant harm to crops if left unchecked."
