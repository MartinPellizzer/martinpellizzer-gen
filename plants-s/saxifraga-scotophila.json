    "intro": "Saxifraga scotophila, commonly known as the shadow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, forming a showy, clustered inflorescence. Saxifraga scotophila is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
