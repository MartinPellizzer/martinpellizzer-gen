    "intro": "Schedonorus littoralis var. minor, commonly known as the coastal meadow grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growth, which helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually bluish-green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This variety is often found in maritime environments and is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
