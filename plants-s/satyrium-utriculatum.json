    "intro": "Satyrium utriculatum, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like structure on the flower spike, which is adapted to trap insects, aiding in pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Satyrium utriculatum is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in areas with high biodiversity."
