    "intro": "Symplocos cochinchinensis var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent wax tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered with fine, short hairs, giving it a pubescent texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
