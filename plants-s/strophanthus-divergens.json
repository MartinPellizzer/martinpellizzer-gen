    "intro": "Strophanthus divergens, commonly known as the African milkvine, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a woody climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it both dangerous and valuable in traditional medicine. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
