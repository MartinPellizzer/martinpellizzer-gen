    "intro": "Spiraea millefolium, commonly known as the leafy spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Spiraea millefolium is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
