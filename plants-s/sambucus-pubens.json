    "intro": "Sambucus pubens, commonly known as the common elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared carefully. Sambucus pubens is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
