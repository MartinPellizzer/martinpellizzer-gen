    "intro": "Siphocampylus ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
