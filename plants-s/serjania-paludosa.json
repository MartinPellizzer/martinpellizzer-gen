    "intro": "Serjania paludosa, commonly known as the swamp serjania, is a shrub or small tree native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Serjania paludosa is adapted to moist, acidic soils and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its wetland habitat."
