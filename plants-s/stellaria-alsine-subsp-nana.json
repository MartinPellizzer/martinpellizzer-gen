It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its small flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies."
