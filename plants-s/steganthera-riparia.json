    "intro": "Steganthera riparia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Americas. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has feathery, floating fronds that are often used in water gardens and aquariums. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Steganthera riparia plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
