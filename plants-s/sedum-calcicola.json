    "intro": "Sedum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in calcium-rich soils, such as those found in limestone regions. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually yellow or white, blooming in summer. Sedum calcicola is often found in rocky crevices and is well adapted to full sun exposure."
