    "intro": "Salix monica, commonly known as the Monica willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in moist or wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers that appear in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a silvery underside, and it produces small, woody capsules that contain its seeds. Salix monica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
