    "intro": "Scilla londonensis, commonly known as the London squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Scilla londonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
