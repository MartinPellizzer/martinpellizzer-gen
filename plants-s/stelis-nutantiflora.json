    "intro": "Stelis nutantiflora, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with stems that trail downward, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis nutantiflora is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or cascade from supports."
