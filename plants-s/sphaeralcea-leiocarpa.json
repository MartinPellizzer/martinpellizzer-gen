    "intro": "Sphaeralcea leiocarpa, commonly known as the white globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and desert margins. The plant features a bushy growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Sphaeralcea leiocarpa is well adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil conditions."
