    "intro": "Setaria mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius foxtail, is a grass species native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
