    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. praeflorens, commonly known as the early goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny habitats. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its flowering period."
