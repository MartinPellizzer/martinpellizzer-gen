    "intro": "Stapelia stellata, commonly known as the star-shaped stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-like flowers that resemble the night sky. The plant produces bright yellow or orange blooms with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. Stapelia stellata is often cultivated for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
