    "intro": "Scandix rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that is often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. Scandix rostrata is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and photodermatitis upon contact with sunlight."
