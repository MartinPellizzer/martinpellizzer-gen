    "intro": "Solidago canadensis var. lepida, commonly known as the showy goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is often found in moist to wet soils in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
