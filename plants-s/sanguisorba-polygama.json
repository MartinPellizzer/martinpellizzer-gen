    "intro": "Sanguisorba polygama, commonly known as redroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are heart-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright red, bracted flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its astringent properties. Sanguisorba polygama thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in wetlands and stream banks."
