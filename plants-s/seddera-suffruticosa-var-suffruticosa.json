    "intro": "Seddera suffruticosa var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features woody stems and is characterized by its fleshy, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
