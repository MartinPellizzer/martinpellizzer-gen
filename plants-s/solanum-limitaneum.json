    "intro": "Solanum limitaneum, commonly known as the coastal nightshade, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. Solanum limitaneum is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
