It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along waterways. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a troublesome weed in many regions."
