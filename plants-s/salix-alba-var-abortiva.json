    "intro": "Salix alba var. abortiva, commonly known as the white willow variant with abortive buds, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variety is notable for its unique floral morphology, where the buds fail to open fully, giving it its specific botanical name."
