    "intro": "Systemonodaphne mezii, commonly known as the Tahitian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture. Its small, white flowers are followed by dark purple berries containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
