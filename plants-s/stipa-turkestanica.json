    "intro": "Stipa turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both spikelets and florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and sandy soils, and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Stipa turkestanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
