    "intro": "Schoenoplectus proximus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomes form dense underground networks, contributing to soil stabilization in marshes and pond edges. Schoenoplectus proximus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species."
