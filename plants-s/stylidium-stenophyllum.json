    "intro": "Stylidium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sun-orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, spurred labellum and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a short, underground rhizome and produces erect, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Stylidium stenophyllum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with features that help it conserve water and attract specific pollinators."
