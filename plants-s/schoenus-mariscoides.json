    "intro": "Schoenus mariscoides, commonly known as the marsh grass or water grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in poorly drained soils, thriving in humid and temperate climates. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in tufts, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schoenus mariscoides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
