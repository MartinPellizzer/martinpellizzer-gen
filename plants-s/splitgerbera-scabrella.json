    "intro": "Splitgerbera scabrella, commonly known as the woolly gerbera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers with showy ray florets. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces yellow disc florets at the center of its flower heads, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Splitgerbera scabrella is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
