It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale lilac flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, thriving in cooler climates. Its hairy stems and leaves, which give it the species name *villosissima*, are distinctive features that aid in its identification."
