    "intro": "Stellaria alpicola, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions to withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in arid environments. Stellaria alpicola is often found in mountain meadows and is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils."
