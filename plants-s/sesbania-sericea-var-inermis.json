It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several round, smooth seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
