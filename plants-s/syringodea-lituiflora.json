    "intro": "Syringodea lituiflora, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in a raceme. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Syringodea lituiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
