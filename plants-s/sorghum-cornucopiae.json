    "intro": "Sorghum cornucopiae, commonly known as the golden horn plant, is a striking species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant orange and yellow inflorescences. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Despite its ornamental appeal, Sorghum cornucopiae is also valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
