    "intro": "Schizoglossum angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved schizoglossum, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
