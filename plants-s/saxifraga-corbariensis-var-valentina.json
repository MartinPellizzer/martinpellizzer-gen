    "intro": "Saxifraga corbariensis var. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscaping."
