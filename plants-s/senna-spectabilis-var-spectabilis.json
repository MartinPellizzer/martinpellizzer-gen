    "intro": "Senna spectabilis var. spectabilis, commonly known as the yellow senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye due to its vibrant colors and medicinal properties."
