    "intro": "Stelis bernoullii, commonly known as the Bernoulli's stelis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis bernoullii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
