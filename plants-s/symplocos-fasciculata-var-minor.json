    "intro": "Symplocos fasciculata var. minor, commonly known as the small-fruited wax myrtle, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
