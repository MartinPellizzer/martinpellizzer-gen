    "intro": "Sarcoglottis cerina, commonly known as the red-tongued orchid, is a tropical plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a red or orange lip, which serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Sarcoglottis cerina is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
