    "intro": "Samanea tubulosa, commonly known as the red tubular acacia, is a tropical legume native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has bipinnate leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain flattened, seed-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Samanea tubulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
