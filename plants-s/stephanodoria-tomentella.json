    "intro": "Stephanodoria tomentella, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stephanodoria tomentella is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
