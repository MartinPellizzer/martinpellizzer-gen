It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dense, rounded clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and provide an attractive backdrop to its showy blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Spiraea thalictroides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
