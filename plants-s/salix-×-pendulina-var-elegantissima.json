    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pendulina var. elegantissima, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It features long, slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, flowing appearance, often giving the tree a weeping or cascading effect. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-green hue on top with a silvery underside. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers, ponds, and lakes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
