It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique spurred petals and vibrant yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
