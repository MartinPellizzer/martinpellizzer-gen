These shrubs are characterized by their clusters of small, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge. Spiraea species are often found in moist or well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
