    "intro": "Scolymocephalus angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scolymus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
