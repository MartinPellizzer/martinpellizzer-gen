    "intro": "Schilleria riparia, commonly known as the river schilleria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and stream edges. The plant features slender, branching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Schilleria riparia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
