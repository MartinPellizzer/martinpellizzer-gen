    "intro": "Styleurodon, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It has broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for various aquatic life. The plant's roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the floating foliage. Styleurodon produces showy white flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night. It plays a significant role in the ecosystem by oxygenating the water and supporting biodiversity."
