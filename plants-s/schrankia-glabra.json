    "intro": "Schrankia glabra, commonly known as the smooth schrankia, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are smooth and often covered in a fine layer of whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and are arranged in a compact cluster, making it an attractive plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
