It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically small and colorful, often appearing in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Succisa brevis is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found growing on rock faces or in sandy environments."
