    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subsp. delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
