    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical marsh club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and wetland areas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy environments. This variety is often found in brackish or saline habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of coastal regions."
