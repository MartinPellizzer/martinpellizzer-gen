    "intro": "Synthyris laciniata subsp. ibapahensis, commonly known as the Ibapah narrowleaf synthyris, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
