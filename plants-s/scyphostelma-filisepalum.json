    "intro": "Scyphostelma filisepalum, commonly known as the thread-sepal starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Scyphostelma filisepalum is considered a rare and endangered species."
