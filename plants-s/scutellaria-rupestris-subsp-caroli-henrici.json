    "intro": "Scutellaria rupestris subsp. caroli-henrici, commonly known as Caroli-Henrici's blue skullcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are borne on whorled inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
