It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Senecio malacophyllus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
