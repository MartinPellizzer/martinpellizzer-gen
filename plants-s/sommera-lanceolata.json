    "intro": "Sommera lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sommera, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes."
