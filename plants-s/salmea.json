    "intro": "Salmea, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss. Salmea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
