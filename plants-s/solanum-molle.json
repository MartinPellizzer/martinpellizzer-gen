    "intro": "Solanum molle, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Solanum molle is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments. It is also known for its edible berries, though they are generally not cultivated for food."
