    "intro": "Salsola canescens, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is a shrub or perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Salsola canescens is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
