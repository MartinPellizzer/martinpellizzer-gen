    "intro": "Selaginella trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branch spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct appearance with a rosette of slender, needle-like leaves and a short, upright stem that bears spore-producing structures called strobila. Its leaves are usually green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid habitat. Selaginella trifurcata is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
