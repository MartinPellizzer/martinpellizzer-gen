    "intro": "Sorbus hypoglauca, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
