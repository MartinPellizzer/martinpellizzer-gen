    "intro": "Salvia canescens var. canescens, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and spikes of purple to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
