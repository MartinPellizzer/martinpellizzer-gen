    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate, airy appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to golden in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive pubescent texture. This grass is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, high-altitude environments."
