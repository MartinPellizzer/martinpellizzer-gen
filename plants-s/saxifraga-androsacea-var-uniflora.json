    "intro": "Saxifraga androsacea var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower atop a slender stem during the short growing season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in cool climates as a garden plant."
