    "intro": "Stipa graniticola, commonly known as the granite grass, is a perennial grass species native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Stipa graniticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky landscapes."
