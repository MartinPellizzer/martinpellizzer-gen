    "intro": "Syzygium oblatum, commonly known as the round-leaf tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sour fruits that are often used in traditional cuisine. Syzygium oblatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which contains seeds encased in a hard, woody pulp."
