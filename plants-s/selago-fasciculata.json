    "intro": "Selago fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense clusters of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, typically during the winter months. Its adaptations to drought include thick, waxy leaves and the ability to store water in its stems. Selago fasciculata is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
