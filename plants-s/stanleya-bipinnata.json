    "intro": "Stanleya bipinnata, commonly known as the twinleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its biennial life cycle, with the first year spent as a basal rosette and the second year producing a flowering stem. The plant features compound leaves with two pairs of leaflets, giving it its scientific name \"bipinnata,\" meaning \"twice-pinnate.\" Its showy blue to purple flowers are arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stanleya bipinnata is adapted to rocky and open habitats, often found in alpine and woodland environments."
