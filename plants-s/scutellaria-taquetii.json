    "intro": "Scutellaria taquetii, commonly known as Taquet's skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
