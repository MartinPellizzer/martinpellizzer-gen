    "intro": "Senecio nigellus, commonly known as the black-rayed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black ray flowers, which contrast with its greenish-yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. Senecio nigellus is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
