    "intro": "Salix petiolaris f. seriocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a unique variant of the willow family characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. This form exhibits a distinct growth habit, often forming dense, shrub-like structures that are well adapted to moist environments. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth margin, and they often have a silvery or pale underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. It is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other waterlogged areas, making it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
