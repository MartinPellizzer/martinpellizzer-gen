    "intro": "Selaginella scandens, commonly known as stair-step moss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form tight, compact clusters. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis, where it enters a dormant state. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize rocky crevices and forest floors. Selaginella scandens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
