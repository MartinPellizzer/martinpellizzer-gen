    "intro": "Scirpus nodosus, commonly known as the nodding bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which typically nod toward the ground. Scirpus nodosus thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and wet meadows. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and is important for wetland ecosystems."
