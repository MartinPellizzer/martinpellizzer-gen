    "intro": "Stelis ingridiana, commonly known as the Ingrid's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns and a sweet fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis ingridiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
