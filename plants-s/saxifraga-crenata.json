    "intro": "Saxifraga crenata, commonly known as the scalycup saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in rock gardens."
