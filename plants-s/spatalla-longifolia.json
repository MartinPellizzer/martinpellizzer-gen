    "intro": "Spatalla longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered spathiphyllum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features striking, elongated white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a large, leaf-like spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Spatalla longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
