    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus subsp. tabernaemontani, commonly known as the salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in water retention. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
