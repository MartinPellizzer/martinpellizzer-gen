    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Nova Scotia pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive red or purple interior that helps in attracting prey. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and requires a humid, sunny environment. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and bloom in late spring to early summer."
