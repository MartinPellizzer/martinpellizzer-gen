    "intro": "Saxifraga engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by succulent enthusiasts."
