    "intro": "Staurogyne sylvatica, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with slightly serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Staurogyne sylvatica plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
