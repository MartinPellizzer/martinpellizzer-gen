    "intro": "Stangea paulae, commonly known as the Pauline's stangea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, Stangea paulae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
