    "intro": "Salvia acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf sage, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant, maple-like leaves that change color with the seasons, ranging from deep green in summer to fiery red or orange in autumn. The plant produces clusters of purple or violet flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic value and seasonal color changes. Salvia acerifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for xeriscaping."
