    "intro": "Scrophularia pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers from June to August. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Scrophularia pluriflora is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
