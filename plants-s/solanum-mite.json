    "intro": "Solanum mite, commonly known as the potato mite, is a tiny arachnid belonging to the family Tetranychidae. It is a significant pest in solanaceous crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers. The mite feeds on the underside of leaves, causing stippling and yellowing, which can reduce crop yield. It reproduces rapidly, with multiple generations occurring within a single growing season. Its presence is often indicated by the presence of fine webbing on the plant."
