It is characterized by its fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it produces small, dark blue berries in the fall. Styrax albus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often used in gardens for its visual appeal."
