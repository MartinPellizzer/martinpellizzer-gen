It is characterized by its long, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.
