    "intro": "Saxifraga sancta, commonly known as the sacred saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Saxifraga sancta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific alpine conditions."
