    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. pourretii, commonly known as the Pourret's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it store water and survive in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
