    "intro": "Stipa tenella, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Stipa tenella is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
