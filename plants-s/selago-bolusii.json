    "intro": "Selago bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to store water and reduce evaporation. Selago bolusii is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
