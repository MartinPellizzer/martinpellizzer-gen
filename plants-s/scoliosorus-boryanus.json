    "intro": "Scoliosorus boryanus, commonly known as the Bory's scoliosorus, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Scoliosorus boryanus is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
