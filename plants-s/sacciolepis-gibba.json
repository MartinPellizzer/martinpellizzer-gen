    "intro": "Sacciolepis gibba, commonly known as the knobbed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, reflecting its halophytic nature and ability to thrive in saline environments. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets. Sacciolepis gibba is often found growing in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
