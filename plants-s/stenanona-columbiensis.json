    "intro": "Stenanona columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia stenanona, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a slight pubescence, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenanona columbiensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
