    "intro": "Silene eriophylla, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Silene eriophylla is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
