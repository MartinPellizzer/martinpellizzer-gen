It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.
