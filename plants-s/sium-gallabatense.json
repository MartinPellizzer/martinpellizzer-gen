    "intro": "Sium gallabatense, commonly known as the Brazilian watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It thrives in wetland environments and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by heart-shaped, edible seeds. It is often found in marshy areas and along the banks of rivers and streams. Due to its preference for moist soils, it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
