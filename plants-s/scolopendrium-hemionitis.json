    "intro": "Scolopendrium hemionitis, commonly known as the Appalachian clubmoss, is a rare and endangered fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Due to habitat loss, it is listed as threatened or endangered in several states."
