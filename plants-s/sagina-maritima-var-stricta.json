It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to salty, sandy soils and can tolerate harsh maritime conditions. This variety is often found in dunes and moist sand habitats along shorelines."
