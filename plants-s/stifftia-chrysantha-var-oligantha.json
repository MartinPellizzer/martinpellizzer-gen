It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens and native plant collections."
