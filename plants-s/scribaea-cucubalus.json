    "intro": "Scribaea cucubalus, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, spherical capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or woodland habitats. Due to its fragrant wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic timber."
