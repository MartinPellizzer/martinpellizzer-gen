    "intro": "Strigilia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a few leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a loose cluster. The intricate network of veins on its leaves gives it its common name, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
