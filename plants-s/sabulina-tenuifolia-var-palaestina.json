    "intro": "Sabulina tenuifolia var. palaestina, commonly known as the Palestinian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Middle East. It features small, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth habit is typically prostrate, allowing it to spread across rocky substrates. It is often found in limestone soils and is well-suited to Mediterranean-type climates."
