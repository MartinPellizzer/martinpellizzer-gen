    "intro": "Selaginella merguina, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosettes of needle-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branching stems. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in diverse conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections."
