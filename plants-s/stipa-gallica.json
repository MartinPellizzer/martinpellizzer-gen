    "intro": "Stipa gallica, commonly known as purple needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Stipa gallica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
