    "intro": "Stipa capilliseta, commonly known as silky needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, spikelike inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spikelet-based flowers. Stipa capilliseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery foliage."
