    "intro": "Selaginella simplex, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-producing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. Selaginella simplex reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its structure and life cycle make it an important subject in the study of bryophytes and early vascular plants."
