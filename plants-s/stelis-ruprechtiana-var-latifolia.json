It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and the plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
