    "intro": "Scaevola frutescens f. moomomiana, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a compact, flowering shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters that give the plant a distinctive, almost star-like appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, saline conditions."
