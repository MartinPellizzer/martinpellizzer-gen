    "intro": "Senegalia centralis, commonly known as the central screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by bean-like pods that contain seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Senegalia centralis also has traditional uses in some African cultures for medicinal and practical purposes."
