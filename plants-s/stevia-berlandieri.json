    "intro": "Stevia berlandieri, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. These compounds are widely used as natural sweeteners in food and beverages. Stevia berlandieri thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
