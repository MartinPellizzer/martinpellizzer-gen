    "intro": "Stevia entreriensis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. These compounds are found primarily in the leaves and are used as a natural, zero-calorie sweetener. Stevia entreriensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation."
