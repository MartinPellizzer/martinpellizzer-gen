    "intro": "Salvia scopulorum, commonly known as cliff sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia scopulorum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
