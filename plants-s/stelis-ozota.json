    "intro": "Stelis ozota, commonly known as the ozot orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, strap-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns and a pleasant fragrance. Stelis ozota is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
