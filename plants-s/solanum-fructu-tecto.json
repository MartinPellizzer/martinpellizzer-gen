    "intro": "Solanum fructu-tecto, commonly known as the hooded nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-shaped calyx that covers the fruit, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green. The fruit, which is toxic, develops from the calyx and is often mistaken for a berry due to its appearance."
