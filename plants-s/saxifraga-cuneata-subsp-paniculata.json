    "intro": "Saxifraga cuneata subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a branching inflorescence, which gives it its species name \"paniculata.\" Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often found in alpine tundra and is a characteristic component of the vegetation in these extreme environments."
