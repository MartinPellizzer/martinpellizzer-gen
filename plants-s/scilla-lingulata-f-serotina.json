    "intro": "Scilla lingulata f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering squill, is a botanical variant of the scilla genus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms later in the growing season compared to other scilla species, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
