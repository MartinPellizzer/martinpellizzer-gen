It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces achene fruits with pappus, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties and use in traditional Chinese medicine."
