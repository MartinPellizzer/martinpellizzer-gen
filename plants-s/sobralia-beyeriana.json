    "intro": "Sobralia beyeriana, commonly known as the Beyer's Sobralia, is a striking tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features vibrant, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple or red markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern. Sobralia beyeriana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
