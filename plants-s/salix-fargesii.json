    "intro": "Salix fargesii, commonly known as the Yunnan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix fargesii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
