    "intro": "Skimmia arborescens, commonly known as winter box or Chinese boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter, providing visual interest during the colder months. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter, which are followed by red berries that persist into spring. Skimmia arborescens thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
