    "intro": "Schoenoxiphium, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their showy yellow or orange inflorescences. Schoenoxiphium species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are often found in open habitats like meadows, woodlands, and roadsides. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
