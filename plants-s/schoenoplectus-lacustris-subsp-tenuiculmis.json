    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris subsp. tenuiculmis, commonly known as narrow-leaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various wetland species."
