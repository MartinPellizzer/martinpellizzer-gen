    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale form of the medicinal sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated margin, while the plant produces distinctive, bead-like seed capsules. This variant is distinguished by its paler coloration compared to the typical form, with lighter green foliage and less intense flower color. It is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental and historical medicinal uses."
