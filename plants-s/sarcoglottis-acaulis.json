    "intro": "Sarcoglottis acaulis, commonly known as the stemless orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of a visible stem, with leaves emerging directly from the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
