    "intro": "Scleromitrion caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Scleromitrion caespitosum is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
