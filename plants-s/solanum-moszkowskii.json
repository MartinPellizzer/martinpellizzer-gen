    "intro": "Solanum moszkowskii, commonly known as the Moszkowski's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when mature, are edible but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Solanum moszkowskii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
