    "intro": "Sida hussonii, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and gray-green in color. Sida hussonii is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
