    "intro": "Scolosanthus crucifer var. subtomentosus, commonly known as the woolly crucifer scolosanthus, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteliaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers, which are typically borne on short, erect spikes. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understoreys. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
