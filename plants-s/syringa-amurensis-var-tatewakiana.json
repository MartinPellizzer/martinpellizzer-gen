    "intro": "Syringa amurensis var. tatewakiana, commonly known as the Amur honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and erosion control."
