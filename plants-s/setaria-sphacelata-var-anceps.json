It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
