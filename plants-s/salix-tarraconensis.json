    "intro": "Salix tarraconensis, commonly known as the Iberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streams, rivers, and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
