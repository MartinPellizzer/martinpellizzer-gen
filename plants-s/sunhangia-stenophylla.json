    "intro": "Sunhangia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sunhangia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sunhangia stenophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
