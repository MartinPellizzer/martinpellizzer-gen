    "intro": "Serruria, commonly known as the \"mountain bells,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, where they typically grow in rocky or mountainous regions. Serruria species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and red. The leaves are usually narrow and serrated, giving the plant its scientific name. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
