    "intro": "Sphaerostigma andinum var. minutum, commonly known as the Andean dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically features a short, stocky rhizome with a few leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
