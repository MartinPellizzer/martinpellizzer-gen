    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 scandica, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving it a graceful and ornamental look. The plant produces catkins as its primary floral structure, which are typically male and contain the pollen. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the autumn. Salix \u00d7 scandica is often found near water bodies and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
