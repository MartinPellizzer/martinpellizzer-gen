    "intro": "Senecio squalidus subsp. siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian ragged-robin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
