It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Scleria pseudohispidior is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
