    "intro": "Salix pyracanthos, commonly known as the red-osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red, angular stems that become more prominent with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by white to pinkish flowers. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Salix pyracanthos is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet or moist conditions."
