    "intro": "Spergularia rubra var. amurensis, commonly known as Amur sandwort, is a flowering plant native to East Asia, particularly found in regions of Russia and China. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and riverbanks. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitats. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
