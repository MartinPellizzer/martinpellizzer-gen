    "intro": "Salix nivea var. grandifolia, commonly known as the white willow with large leaves, is a variant of the white willow species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows along streams and in moist, well-drained soils, preferring cooler climates. Its catkins are conspicuous, with male and female flowers appearing on separate branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in traditional ecological systems."
