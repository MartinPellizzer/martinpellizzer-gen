    "intro": "Striga flava, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds are highly resilient and can remain viable in soil for many years, making it a persistent agricultural pest. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on crop yields, Striga flava is a significant concern in regions where it infests staple food crops."
