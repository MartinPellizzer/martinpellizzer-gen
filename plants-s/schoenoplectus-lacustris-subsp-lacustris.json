    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris subsp. lacustris, commonly known as the lake sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, lake margins, and wet meadows. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
