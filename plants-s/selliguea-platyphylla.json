    "intro": "Selliguea platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf hepatic, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, leaf-like body that is often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus. Selliguea platyphylla plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
