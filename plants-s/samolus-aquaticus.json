    "intro": "Samolus aquaticus, commonly known as water thimble or water sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Samolus aquaticus is often found in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in temperate regions. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
