    "intro": "Strophanthus preussii f. multinervis, commonly known as the African blood vine, is a striking climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves with prominent veins, which give it the specific epithet *multinervis*. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by ornamental, fleshy berries. Its stems are woody and often have a reddish hue, contributing to its dramatic appearance. This species is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
