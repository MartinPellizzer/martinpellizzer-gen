    "intro": "Schrankia potosina, commonly known as the Potosi milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schrankia potosina is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it a plant to handle with care."
