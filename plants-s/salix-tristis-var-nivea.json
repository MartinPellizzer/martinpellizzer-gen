    "intro": "Salix tristis var. nivea, commonly known as the white willow, is a variety of the weeping willow that exhibits distinctive white pubescence on its young shoots. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, with heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are catkins, which are inconspicuous but essential for wind pollination. The white willow is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
