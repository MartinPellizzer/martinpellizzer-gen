It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Seguieria longifolia is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying wetland ecosystems and plant adaptation to aquatic conditions."
