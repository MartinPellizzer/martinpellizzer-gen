    "intro": "Solanum grandiflorum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
