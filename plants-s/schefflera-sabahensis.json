    "intro": "Schefflera sabahensis, commonly known as the Sabah schefflera, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like cluster of leaves at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing as an understory plant in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
