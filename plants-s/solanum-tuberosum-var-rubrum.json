    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. rubrum, commonly known as the red potato, is a variant of the common potato characterized by its distinctive reddish skin and flesh. This variety belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, producing tubers that are harvested for culinary use. Its botanical features include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and small white flowers that develop into berries. The red pigmentation in its tubers is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its unique appearance and potential health benefits."
