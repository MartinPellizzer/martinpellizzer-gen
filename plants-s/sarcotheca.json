    "intro": "Sarcotheca, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, red or pink flowers that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, often glabrous bark. Its leaves are usually opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. Sarcotheca species are native to Australia and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
