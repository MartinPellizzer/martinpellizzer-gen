This plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include slender, erect culms with narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant exhibits a clump-forming growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. It is notable for its adaptability and ability to spread vegetatively through its stolons."
