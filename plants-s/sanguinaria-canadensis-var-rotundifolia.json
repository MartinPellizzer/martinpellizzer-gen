It is characterized by its distinctive red-orange sap, which exudes from the rhizome when the stem is broken. The plant features a single, showy white flower with a red spathe, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and have a waxy texture. This variant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
