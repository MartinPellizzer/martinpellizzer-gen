    "intro": "Scilla italica, commonly known as Italian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces striking blue or purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a spherical shape. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and ability to naturalize over time."
