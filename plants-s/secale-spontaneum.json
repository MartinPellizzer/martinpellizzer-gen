    "intro": "Secale spontaneum, commonly known as wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
