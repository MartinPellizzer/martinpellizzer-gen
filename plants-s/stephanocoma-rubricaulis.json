    "intro": "Stephanocoma rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed stephanocoma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its reddish-brown stems are a distinguishing feature, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Stephanocoma rubricaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
