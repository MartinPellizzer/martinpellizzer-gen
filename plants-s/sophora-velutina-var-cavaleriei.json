    "intro": "Sophora velutina var. cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to China. It is characterized by its long, pendulous racemes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and a hairy texture on young shoots, giving it its species name \"velutina.\" It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seedlings."
