    "intro": "Syncephalum, commonly known as the \"moonflower\" or \"night-blooming false dahlia,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Asteraceae family. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that open at night. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the stems are often hairy. Syncephalum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique blooming habits and vibrant flower colors. They thrive in well-drained soil and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
