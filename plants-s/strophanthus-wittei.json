    "intro": "Strophanthus wittei, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed African milk vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its yellowish stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Its latex contains cardioactive alkaloids, making it both valuable and dangerous. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
