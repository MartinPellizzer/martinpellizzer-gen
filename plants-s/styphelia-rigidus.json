It is a low-growing shrub with dense, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. Styphelia rigidus thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and sand dunes. It is an important component of the local flora, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
