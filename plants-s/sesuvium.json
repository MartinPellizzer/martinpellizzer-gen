    "intro": "Sesuvium, commonly known as sea pink, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and arid environments, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Sesuvium species are adapted to withstand salt spray and high temperatures, making them resilient to harsh maritime conditions. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an important component of coastal ecosystems."
