It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white, nocturnal flowers that open at night and emit a faint fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
