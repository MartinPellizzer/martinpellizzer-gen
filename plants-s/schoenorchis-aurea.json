    "intro": "Schoenorchis aurea, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique coloration and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, Schoenorchis aurea is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
