    "intro": "Styphelia retrorsa, commonly known as the backward-stalked wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath or heather family, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing a dense cover that helps protect the plant from harsh coastal conditions. Styphelia retrorsa is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in damp, shaded environments along the shoreline."
