    "intro": "Salvia carnea, commonly known as pink sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to pink flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia carnea is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is used in traditional herbal medicine."
