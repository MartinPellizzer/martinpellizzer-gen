    "intro": "Stisseria curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's stisseria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
