It features succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to high salinity. Its structure is compact and upright, with a branching habit that helps it withstand wind and salt spray. The species plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
