It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are ovate with a rough texture. Sida tetracocca is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is also known for its fluffy, cotton-like seed pods that aid in wind dispersal."
