    "intro": "Saxifraga maderensis var. pickeringii, commonly known as the Pickering's saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Portugal. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
