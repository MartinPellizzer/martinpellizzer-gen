    "intro": "Secale ancestrale var. dighoricum, commonly known as the Dighori rye, is a rare and ancient grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
