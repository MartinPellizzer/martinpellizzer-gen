    "intro": "Saponaria prostrata subsp. anatolica, commonly known as Turkish soapwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Anatolia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the entire plant is covered in a fine, soapy residue when crushed. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
