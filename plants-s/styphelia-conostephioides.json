    "intro": "Styphelia conostephioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate beauty to its habitat. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
