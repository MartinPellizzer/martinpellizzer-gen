    "intro": "Scorzonera verrucosa, commonly known as the rough scorzonera, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spindle-shaped tubers underground, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Scorzonera verrucosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
