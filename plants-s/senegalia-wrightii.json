    "intro": "Senegalia wrightii, commonly known as honey mesquite, is a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has compound leaves that are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in desert and grassland ecosystems. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures."
