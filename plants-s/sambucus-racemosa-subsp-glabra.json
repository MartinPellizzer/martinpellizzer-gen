It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
