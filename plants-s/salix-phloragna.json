    "intro": "Salix phloragna, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and has small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy beneath. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
