    "intro": "Sphaerostigma boothii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped appearance. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and shaded habitat. It thrives in well-draining substrates and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Sphaerostigma boothii is valued in horticulture for its striking floral display and is relatively easy to care for under the right conditions."
