    "intro": "Stenanthella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Stenanthella is characterized by its unique morphology and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
