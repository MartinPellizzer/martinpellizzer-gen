    "intro": "Sapindus australis, commonly known as the Australian soapberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine, and the fruit's pulp is sometimes used as a natural soap substitute. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
