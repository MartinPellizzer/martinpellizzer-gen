    "intro": "Salix balansae var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
