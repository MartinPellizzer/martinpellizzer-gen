    "intro": "Senegalia lacerans, commonly known as the brittlebark acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by long, thin pods that contain seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Senegalia lacerans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
