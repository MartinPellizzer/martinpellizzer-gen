    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum humile, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its growth is typically limited to the canopy of its host, where it forms dense clusters. Sciodaphyllum humile plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
