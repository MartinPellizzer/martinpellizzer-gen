    "intro": "Solidago canadensis, commonly known as Canadian goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Canadian goldenrod is an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators."
