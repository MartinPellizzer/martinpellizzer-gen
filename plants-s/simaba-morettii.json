    "intro": "Simaba morettii, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that release small, winged seeds when mature. Due to overharvesting, Simaba morettii is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
