It produces striking blue to violet flowers in the autumn, which are typically bell-shaped and clustered in umbels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
