    "intro": "Stenocactus zacatecasensis, commonly known as the Zacatecas cactus, is a species native to the rocky hills of Zacatecas, Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a single stem that typically grows to a height of about 20 centimeters. Its surface is covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
