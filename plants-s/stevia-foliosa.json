    "intro": "Stevia foliosa, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Its leaves are typically harvested when young and tender for maximum sweetness. Stevia foliosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and easy care requirements."
