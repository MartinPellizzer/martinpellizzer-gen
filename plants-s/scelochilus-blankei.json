    "intro": "Scelochilus blankei, commonly known as the Blanke's rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring showy, often fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, demonstrating an adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scelochilus blankei is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species."
