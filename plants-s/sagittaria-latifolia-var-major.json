    "intro": "Sagittaria latifolia var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with the leaves often displaying a broad, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that emerge above the water surface during the summer months. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic life."
