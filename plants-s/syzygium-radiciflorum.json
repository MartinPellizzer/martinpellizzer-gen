    "intro": "Syzygium radiciflorum, commonly known as the root-flowered syzygium, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves and produces edible, aromatic berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its unique floral structure, with flowers emerging from the base of the leaves, gives it its common name. Syzygium radiciflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
