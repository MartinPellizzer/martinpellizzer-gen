    "intro": "Saxifraga quinquedens, commonly known as the five-leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are usually five in number, hence the species name, and are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Saxifraga quinquedens is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and tundra environments."
