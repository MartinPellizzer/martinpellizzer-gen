It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have small, succulent leaves and produce vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Schollia species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in harsh climates."
