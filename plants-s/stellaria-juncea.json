    "intro": "Stellaria juncea, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, star-shaped white flowers and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, toothed leaves. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Stellaria juncea is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
