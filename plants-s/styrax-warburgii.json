    "intro": "Styrax warburgii, commonly known as the fragrant styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous, aromatic gum that has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Styrax warburgii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
