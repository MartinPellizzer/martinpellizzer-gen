    "intro": "Symphyotrichum novi-belgii var. tardiflorum, commonly known as late New Jersey aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its later blooming period compared to other members of the Symphyotrichum genus."
