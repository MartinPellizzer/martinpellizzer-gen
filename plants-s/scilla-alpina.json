It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often bulbous growth habit. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. Scilla alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges."
