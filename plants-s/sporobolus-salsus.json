    "intro": "Sporobolus salsus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to withstand high salinity and drought conditions, making it a common species in coastal and desert regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Sporobolus salsus is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and other saline habitats."
