    "intro": "Solanum richardii var. acutilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, green leaves with acute lobes and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. Following flowering, it develops berries that are initially green and turn red when mature. This variant is notable for its horticultural interest and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
