    "intro": "Sarothra, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pale purple or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a low-growing, succulent habit, allowing it to store water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Sarothra blooms during the summer months, typically from November to March, and relies on pollination by insects such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
