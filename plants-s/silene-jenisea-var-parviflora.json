It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to other varieties of Silene jenisea."
