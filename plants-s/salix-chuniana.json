    "intro": "Salix chuniana, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches that hang gracefully from the crown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are elongated, slender, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
