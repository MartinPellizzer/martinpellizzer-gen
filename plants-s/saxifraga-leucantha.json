    "intro": "Saxifraga leucantha, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga leucantha is a hardy perennial that is often found growing in crevices and on mountain slopes."
