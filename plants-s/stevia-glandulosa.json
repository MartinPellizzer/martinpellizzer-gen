    "intro": "Stevia glandulosa, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Stevia glandulosa is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. It is widely used as a natural sweetener and has gained popularity as a low-calorie alternative to sugar."
