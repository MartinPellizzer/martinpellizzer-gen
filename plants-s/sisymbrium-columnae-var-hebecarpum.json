    "intro": "Sisymbrium columnae var. hebecarpum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, often scale-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain seeds with a distinctive, hooked beak. It typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and is found in regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings."
