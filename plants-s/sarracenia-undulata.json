    "intro": "Sarracenia undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf pitcher plant, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that form deep, tubular pitchers to trap insects. The plant is a carnivorous species that uses its modified leaves to digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils. The pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a hairy interior that aids in trapping insects. Sarracenia undulata thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps."
