    "intro": "Silene ciliata subsp. graefferi, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Silene ciliata subsp. graefferi is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations."
