    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 princeps-ourayi, commonly known as the Ouray willow, is a hybrid species native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands. The plant has slender, often multi-stemmed branches and produces catkins in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The Ouray willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion."
