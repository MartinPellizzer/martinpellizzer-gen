    "intro": "Sorbus wilmottiana, commonly known as the Wilmott's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and distinctive white to pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Sorbus wilmottiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
