It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its most distinctive characteristic is the dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge."
