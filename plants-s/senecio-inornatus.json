    "intro": "Senecio inornatus, commonly known as the woolly lion's tail, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance, and its stems are often branched and upright. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
