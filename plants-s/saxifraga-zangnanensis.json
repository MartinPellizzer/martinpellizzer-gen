    "intro": "Saxifraga zangnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
