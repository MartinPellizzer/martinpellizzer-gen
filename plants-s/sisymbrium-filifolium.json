    "intro": "Sisymbrium filifolium, commonly known as wild winter cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with linear lobes, and small yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruits are slender, pod-like structures that split open to release seeds when mature. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
