    "intro": "Stenocarpus moorei, commonly known as the Moore's tree fern, is a striking evergreen tree fern native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant's growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a long-term addition to any landscape."
