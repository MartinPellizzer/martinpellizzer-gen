    "intro": "Suaeda cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to regions such as the Mediterranean and parts of North America. Suaeda cinerea is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
