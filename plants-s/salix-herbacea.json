    "intro": "Salix herbacea, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks or in wet meadows. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
