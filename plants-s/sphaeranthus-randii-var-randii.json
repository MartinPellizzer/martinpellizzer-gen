It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spherical cluster, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal rainfall."
