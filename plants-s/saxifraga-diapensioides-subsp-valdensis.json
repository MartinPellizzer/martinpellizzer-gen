    "intro": "Saxifraga diapensioides subsp. valdensis, commonly known as the Valdensian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
