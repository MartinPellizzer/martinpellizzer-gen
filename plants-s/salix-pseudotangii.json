    "intro": "Salix pseudotangii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family."
