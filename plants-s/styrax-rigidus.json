    "intro": "Styrax rigidus, commonly known as the rigid styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. Styrax rigidus is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
