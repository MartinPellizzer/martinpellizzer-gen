    "intro": "Santalum margaretae, commonly known as the Margaretae sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its fragrant heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas."
