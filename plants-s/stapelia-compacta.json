    "intro": "Stapelia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf starplant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and ornamental flowers. Stapelia compacta is also known for its strong, sweet scent, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles."
