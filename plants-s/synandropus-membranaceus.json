    "intro": "Synandropus membranaceus, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, and its leaves are often covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are unique, with synandrous stamens and carpels fused together in a specialized arrangement. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
