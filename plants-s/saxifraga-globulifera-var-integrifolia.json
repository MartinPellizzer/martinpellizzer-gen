It features compact, rosette-like growth with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical structure reflects its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
