    "intro": "Stenogrammitis hartii, commonly known as the Hart's stenogrammitis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Stenogrammitis hartii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
