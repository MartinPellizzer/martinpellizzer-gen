    "intro": "Spiraea brahuica var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) underside that gives the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
