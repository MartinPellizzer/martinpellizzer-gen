    "intro": "Silene cucubalus var. maritima, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Silene cucubalus var. maritima is well adapted to maritime conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
