    "intro": "Scleranthus stroblii, commonly known as the Stroblii sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small annual herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed areas. Scleranthus stroblii is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
