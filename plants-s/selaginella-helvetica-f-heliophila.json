    "intro": "Selaginella helvetica f. heliophila, commonly known as the sun-loving clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, though the 'heliophila' form prefers more sunlight. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
