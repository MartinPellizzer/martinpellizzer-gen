    "intro": "Senecio lagascanus subsp. lusitanicus, commonly known as the Lusitanian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, daisy-like flower heads that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
