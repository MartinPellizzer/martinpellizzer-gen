    "intro": "Salix cordata var. vitellina, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a variant of the common willow that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically a vibrant yellow-green on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
