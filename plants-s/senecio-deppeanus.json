    "intro": "Senecio deppeanus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio deppeanus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
