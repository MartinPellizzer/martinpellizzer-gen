    "intro": "Senecio graveolens, commonly known as the stinking weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to brown ray flowers. It has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Senecio graveolens is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
