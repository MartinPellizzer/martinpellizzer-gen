    "intro": "Skoliostigma, commonly known as the \"spearhead fern,\" is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Skoliostigma species have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
