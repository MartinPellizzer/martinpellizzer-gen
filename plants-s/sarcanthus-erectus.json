    "intro": "Sarcanthus erectus, commonly known as the upright cantharid, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive morphology and ecological niche. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy surface, adapting to the moist conditions it thrives in. Sarcanthus erectus produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species."
