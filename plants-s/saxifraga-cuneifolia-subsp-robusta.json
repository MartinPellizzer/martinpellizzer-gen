    "intro": "Saxifraga cuneifolia subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats of dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a pointed tip and a rough, hairy texture. Saxifraga cuneifolia subsp. robusta is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
