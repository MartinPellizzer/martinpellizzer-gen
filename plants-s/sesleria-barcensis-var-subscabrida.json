It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly scabrous texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
