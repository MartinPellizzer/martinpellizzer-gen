    "intro": "Solanum violaceum var. scabrum, commonly known as the rough violetleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features hairy, often glandular leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. It is characterized by its rough, scabrous texture, which gives it its specific variety name. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
