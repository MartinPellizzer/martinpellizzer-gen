    "intro": "Scirpus coarctatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in the summer. Scirpus coarctatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
