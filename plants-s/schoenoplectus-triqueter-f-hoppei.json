    "intro": "Schoenoplectus triqueter f. hoppei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in marshy environments and is often found in shallow water or saturated soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for wetland wildlife."
