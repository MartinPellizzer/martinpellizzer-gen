    "intro": "Stipa parishii, commonly known as the Parish's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Stipa parishii plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
