    "intro": "Sorbus alpina compacta, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
