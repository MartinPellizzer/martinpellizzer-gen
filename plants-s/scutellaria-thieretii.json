    "intro": "Scutellaria thieretii, commonly known as Thieret's blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Scutellaria thieretii is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
