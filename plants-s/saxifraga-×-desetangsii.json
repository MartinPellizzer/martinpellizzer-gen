    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 desetangsii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga moschata, giving it unique morphological traits. Saxifraga \u00d7 desetangsii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in alpine gardens and rockeries."
