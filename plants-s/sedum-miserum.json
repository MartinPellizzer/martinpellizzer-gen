    "intro": "Sedum miserum, commonly known as the weeping sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, Sedum miserum is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in drought-tolerant landscapes."
