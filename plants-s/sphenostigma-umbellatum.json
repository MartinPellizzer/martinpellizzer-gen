    "intro": "Sphenostigma umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and the presence of small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are clustered in umbellate arrangements, giving the plant its common name. Sphenostigma umbellatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
