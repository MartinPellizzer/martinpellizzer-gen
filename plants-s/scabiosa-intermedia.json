    "intro": "Scabiosa intermedia, commonly known as the common scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and wildflower meadows. Scabiosa intermedia is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
