It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and often have a fringed or toothed appearance, contributing to its common name. This species thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
