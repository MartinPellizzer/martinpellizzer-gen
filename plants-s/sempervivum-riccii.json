    "intro": "Sempervivum riccii, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple tints, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Sempervivum riccii is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
