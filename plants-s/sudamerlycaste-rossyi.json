    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste rossyi, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fruit, which resembles a starfruit, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. However, due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated plant."
