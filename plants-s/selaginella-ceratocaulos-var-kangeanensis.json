    "intro": "Selaginella ceratocaulos var. kangeanensis, commonly known as the Kangean spike moss, is a rare and endemic species found in the Indonesian island of Kangean. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, spiky leaves that are tightly spiraled around the stem. The plant is a cryptogamic species, reproducing through spores rather than seeds, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
