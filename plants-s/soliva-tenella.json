    "intro": "Soliva tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, dry soils. Soliva tenella is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
