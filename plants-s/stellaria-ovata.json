    "intro": "Stellaria ovata, commonly known as the oval starwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in environments such as meadows, fields, and along streambanks. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern. Its leaves are ovate, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. Stellaria ovata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
