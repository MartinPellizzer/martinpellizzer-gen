    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 godferyi nothosubsp. godferyi, commonly known as the hybrid serapias, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that typically range from yellow to orange and red. The plant exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Serapias grandiflora and Serapias vernalis, resulting in unique floral morphology. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
