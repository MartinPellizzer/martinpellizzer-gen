    "intro": "Spiraea opulifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
