    "intro": "Senecio gyrophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
