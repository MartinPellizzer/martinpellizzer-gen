It features fleshy, gray-green leaves with distinctive tubercles, or bumps, that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, conical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
