    "intro": "Salix elaeagnoides, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silvery-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside, and they turn yellow in autumn. Silver willow is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as riverbanks and woodland edges."
