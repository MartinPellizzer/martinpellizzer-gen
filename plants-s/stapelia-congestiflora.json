    "intro": "Stapelia congestiflora, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its distinctive, meaty-looking flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces large, yellowish-green blooms with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Stapelia congestiflora is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
