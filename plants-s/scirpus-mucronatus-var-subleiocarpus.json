    "intro": "Scirpus mucronatus var. subleiocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit bulrush, is a wetland plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The variety subleiocarpus is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated fruits compared to the typical form."
