    "intro": "Syrmatium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth syrmatium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Syrmatium glabrum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves contribute to its common name and distinguish it from related species."
