    "intro": "Salix capensis, commonly known as the cape willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. Salix capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
