    "intro": "Senecio altimontanus, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are generally narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Senecio altimontanus produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
