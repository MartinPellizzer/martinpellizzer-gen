    "intro": "Stoerkia, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in wet or marshy environments across Europe and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. Stoerkia species are often rhizomatous, with fibrous roots that help them thrive in moist soil conditions. They play an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and other wildlife."
