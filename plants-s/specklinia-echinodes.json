    "intro": "Specklinia echinodes, commonly known as the spiky specklinia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in summer and are pollinated by insects."
