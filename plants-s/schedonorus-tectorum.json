    "intro": "Schedonorus tectorum, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, soft leaves that are often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily. Schedonorus tectorum is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
