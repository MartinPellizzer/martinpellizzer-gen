    "intro": "Salix drummondiana var. bella, commonly known as Drummond's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, multi-stemmed growth with finely toothed leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful form and seasonal foliage changes."
