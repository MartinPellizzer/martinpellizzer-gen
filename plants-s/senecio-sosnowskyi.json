    "intro": "Senecio sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's Hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern and central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
