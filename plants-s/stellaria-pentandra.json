It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a common sight in gardens and wildflower habitats."
