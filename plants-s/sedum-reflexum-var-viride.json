    "intro": "Sedum reflexum var. viride, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, upright leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions with minimal care."
