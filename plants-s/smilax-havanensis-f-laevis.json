    "intro": "Smilax havanensis f. laevis, commonly known as the smooth smilax, is a variant of the smilax genus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a slightly waxy texture. Smilax havanensis f. laevis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
