    "intro": "Salix opsimantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and alpine meadows. Salix opsimantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
