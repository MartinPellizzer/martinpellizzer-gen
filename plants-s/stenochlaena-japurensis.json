    "intro": "Stenochlaena japurensis, commonly known as the Japur\u00e9 fern, is a rare and unique species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
