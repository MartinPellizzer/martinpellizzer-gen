    "intro": "Sciaphila hydrophila, commonly known as the water shade plant, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has elongated, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or yellow, are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila hydrophila is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
