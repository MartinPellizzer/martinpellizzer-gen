    "intro": "Salix hastata var. maritima, commonly known as saltcedar or tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, appearing in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland saline habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
