    "intro": "Sabulina laricifolia, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows. The plant has small, fleshy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh winter conditions. Sabulina laricifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
