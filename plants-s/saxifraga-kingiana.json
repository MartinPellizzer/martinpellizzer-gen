It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
