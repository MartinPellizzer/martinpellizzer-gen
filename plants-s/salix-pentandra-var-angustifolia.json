    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, rivers, and wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
