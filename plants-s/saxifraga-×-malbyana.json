    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 malbyana, commonly known as the Malby's saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in alpine and subarctic environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga \u00d7 malbyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh, mountainous terrain."
