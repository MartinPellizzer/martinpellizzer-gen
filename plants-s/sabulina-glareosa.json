    "intro": "Sabulina glareosa, commonly known as the glaucous sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountain environments. Its botanical characteristics reflect its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
