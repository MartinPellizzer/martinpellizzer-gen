    "intro": "Salvia setulosa, commonly known as woodland sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hair-like structures called setae, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Salvia setulosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
