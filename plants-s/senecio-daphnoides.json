    "intro": "Senecio daphnoides, commonly known as the Woolly Blueweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine white hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Senecio daphnoides is a perennial herb that is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
