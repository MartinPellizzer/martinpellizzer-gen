It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually ovate with a rough texture. Sida leopoldii is characterized by its fibrous stems and is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability to arid environments."
