    "intro": "Stelis nanegalensis, commonly known as the dwarf stelis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Stelis nanegalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
