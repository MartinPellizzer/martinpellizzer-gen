    "intro": "Scrophularia canina var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf dog's mouth, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. This variety is smaller than the typical Scrophularia canina, with a more compact growth habit."
