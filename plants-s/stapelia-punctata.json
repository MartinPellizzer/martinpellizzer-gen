It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red markings. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and spiny, providing additional protection against herbivores. Stapelia punctata blooms during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat."
