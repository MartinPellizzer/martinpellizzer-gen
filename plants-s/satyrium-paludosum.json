    "intro": "Satyrium paludosum, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Satyrium paludosum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
