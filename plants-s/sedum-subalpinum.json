    "intro": "Sedum subalpinum, commonly known as alpine stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Sedum subalpinum is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
