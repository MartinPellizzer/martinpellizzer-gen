    "intro": "Saxifraga capillipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has hairy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows. Saxifraga capillipes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
