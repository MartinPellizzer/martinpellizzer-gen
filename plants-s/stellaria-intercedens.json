    "intro": "Stellaria intercedens, commonly known as common mouse-ear or starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
