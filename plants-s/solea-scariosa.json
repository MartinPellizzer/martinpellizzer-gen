    "intro": "Solea scariosa, commonly known as the scaly sole, is a species of flatfish belonging to the family Soleidae. It is characterized by its asymmetrical body shape, with one eye migrating to the top side during development. The plant's skin is covered in a layer of scaly, translucent tissue that provides protection. It typically inhabits sandy or muddy bottoms in shallow coastal waters. This species is valued for its delicate flavor and is often found in marine ecosystems along the Atlantic coast."
