    "intro": "Steptorhamphus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf club-moss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lepidoziaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
