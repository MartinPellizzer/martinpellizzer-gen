    "intro": "Smilax iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the Iriomote Island in Japan. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its stout, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the arum family. Smilax iriomotensis is also notable for its tuberous roots, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
