    "intro": "Symphoricarpos leucocarpus, commonly known as white-fruited sand-cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, white berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
