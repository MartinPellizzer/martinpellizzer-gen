    "intro": "Schefflera metcalfiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
