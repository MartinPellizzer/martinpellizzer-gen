    "intro": "Stelis walteri, commonly known as the Walter's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, intricate structure. Stelis walteri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to flourish. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
