    "intro": "Specklinia jalapensis, commonly known as the Jalape\u00f1o fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Specklinia jalapensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care in the right conditions."
