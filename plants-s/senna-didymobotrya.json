    "intro": "Senna didymobotrya, commonly known as the African senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and consist of multiple pairs of leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its medicinal properties. Senna didymobotrya is often used in traditional medicine for its laxative effects due to the presence of saponins and alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland areas."
