    "intro": "Schefflera peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of large, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera peruviana is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its relatively slow growth rate."
