    "intro": "Satyrium coriifolium var. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface and often bear distinctive white or pale spots. This variety is closely related to other members of the Gentianaceae family, known for their showy, often blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments."
