    "intro": "Senecio nemorensis subsp. stabianus, commonly known as the Stabian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the limestone regions of southern Italy. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Asteraceae family."
