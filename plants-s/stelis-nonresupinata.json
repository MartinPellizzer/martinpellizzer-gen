    "intro": "Stelis nonresupinata, commonly known as the upright stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit, distinguishing it from other stelis species that often grow in a resupinate (upside-down) position. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
