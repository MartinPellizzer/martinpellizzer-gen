    "intro": "Salix himalayensis var. filistyla, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typical of willow species, and its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped. It is often found in stream banks and wet meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The variety filistyla is distinguished by its specific morphological traits, including its leaf structure and flowering patterns."
