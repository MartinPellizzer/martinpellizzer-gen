    "intro": "Syngrammatopsis, commonly known as the false acanthus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bract-like leaves that resemble the foliage of true acanthus species. Syngrammatopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
