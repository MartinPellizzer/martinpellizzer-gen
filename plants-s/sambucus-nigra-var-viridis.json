    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. viridis, commonly known as the green elderberry, is a variant of the common elderberry. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish foliage, which sets it apart from the typical dark green leaves of the standard Sambucus nigra. The plant produces small, white flowers in umbels, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It is native to Europe and prefers moist, shady environments. Like other elderberries, it contains toxic compounds in its raw form but is used in culinary applications when properly prepared."
