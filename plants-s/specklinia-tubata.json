It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to form tubers underground, which help it survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers are small and fragrant. Specklinia tubata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
