    "intro": "Savia platyrachis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and pairs of opposite, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to arid landscapes."
