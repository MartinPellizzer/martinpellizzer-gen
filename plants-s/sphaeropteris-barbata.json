    "intro": "Sphaeropteris barbata, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales, which give it its common name. Sphaeropteris barbata is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
