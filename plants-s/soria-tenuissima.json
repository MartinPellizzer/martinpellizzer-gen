It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
