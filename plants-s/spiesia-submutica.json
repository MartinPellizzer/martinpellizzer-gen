    "intro": "Spiesia submutica, commonly known as the rough-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Spiesia submutica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
