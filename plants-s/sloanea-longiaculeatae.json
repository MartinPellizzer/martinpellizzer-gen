It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, simple leaves, and small, clustered flowers. It typically grows in humid, lowland forests and thrives in shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
