    "intro": "Stipa barbinodis, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy lemma that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical panicle with closely arranged spikelets. Stipa barbinodis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
