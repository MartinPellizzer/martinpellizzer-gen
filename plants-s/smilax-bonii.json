    "intro": "Smilax bonii, commonly known as the Chinese smilax, is a climbing shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that range in color from red to black. Smilax bonii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and resilient species in its native habitat."
