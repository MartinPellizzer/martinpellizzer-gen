    "intro": "Sempervivum hillebrandtii, commonly known as the Hillebrandt's houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions has earned it the common name \"everlasting,\" reflecting its resilience and long lifespan."
