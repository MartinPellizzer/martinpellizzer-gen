    "intro": "Saxifraga karadzicensis, commonly known as the Karadzic's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically clustered in a single inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
