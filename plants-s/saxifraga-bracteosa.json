    "intro": "Saxifraga bracteosa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Saxifraga bracteosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and tundra ecosystems."
