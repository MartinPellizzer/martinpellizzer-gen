    "intro": "Scyphostelma longecalicinum, commonly known as the long-stalked starry bell, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity, it is often protected in its native habitats."
