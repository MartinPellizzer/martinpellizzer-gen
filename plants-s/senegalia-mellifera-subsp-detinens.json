    "intro": "Senegalia mellifera subsp. detinens, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hard pods containing edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife and humans. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for desert animals."
