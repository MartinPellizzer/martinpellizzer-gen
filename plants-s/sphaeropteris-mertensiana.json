    "intro": "Sphaeropteris mertensiana, commonly known as the Mertens' cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
