    "intro": "Spondias macrophylla, commonly known as the Natal plum or Indian plum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, orange-red drupes with a sweet, tangy flavor. Its fruit is an important food source for both wildlife and humans in its native habitats. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
