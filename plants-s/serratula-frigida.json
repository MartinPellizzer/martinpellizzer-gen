    "intro": "Serratula frigida, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils, while its hairy foliage reduces water loss in arid conditions. Serratula frigida is often found in open meadows and on mountain slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
