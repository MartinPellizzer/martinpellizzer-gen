    "intro": "Spiesia viscida, commonly known as the sticky spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, glandular-stemmed structure that exudes a sticky substance when damaged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Spiesia viscida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
