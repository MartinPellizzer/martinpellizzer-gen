    "intro": "Selaginella albonitens, commonly known as the white-stemmed spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella albonitens is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique adaptations to retain moisture."
