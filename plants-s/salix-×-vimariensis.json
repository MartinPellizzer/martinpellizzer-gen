    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 vimariensis, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the British Isles. It is a natural hybrid between Salix cinerea and Salix viminalis, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin and a bluish-green upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. This species is often found in wet or moist soils, making it a common sight in river valleys and along watercourses."
