    "intro": "Scilla bifolia subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have bloomed. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high-altitude conditions."
