    "intro": "Senecio miser var. tehuelches, commonly known as the Tehuelche ragged robin, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
