    "intro": "Scolymocephalus marginatus, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in shallow, often saline waters along coasts and estuaries. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in fluctuating salinity and oxygen levels."
