It features succulent, cylindrical stems covered in a smooth, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Syncolostemon concinnus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
