    "intro": "Statice verrucosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Statice verrucosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes and floral arrangements."
