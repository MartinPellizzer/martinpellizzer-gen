    "intro": "Sedum kostovii, commonly known as the Kostov's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Balkans. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It grows low to the ground, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Sedum kostovii is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
