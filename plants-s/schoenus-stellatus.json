    "intro": "Schoenus stellatus, commonly known as the star grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, star-like arrangement of spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its slender, erect stems are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental appearance. Schoenus stellatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
