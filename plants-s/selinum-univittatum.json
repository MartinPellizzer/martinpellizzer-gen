It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Selinum univittatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
