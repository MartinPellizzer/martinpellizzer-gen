It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Styrax floribundus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various soil types."
