    "intro": "Sidalcea nitrophila, commonly known as the nitrogen-fixing checkerbloom, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. Sidalcea nitrophila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
