    "intro": "Sauvallella immarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Sauvallella immarginata is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions of low rainfall and high temperatures."
