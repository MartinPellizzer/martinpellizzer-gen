    "intro": "Synthyris cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaved synthyris, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their acute tips and prominent veins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Synthyris cordata is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
