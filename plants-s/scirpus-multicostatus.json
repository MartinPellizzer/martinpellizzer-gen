    "intro": "Scirpus multicostatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems and broad, flat leaves that are often ribbed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Scirpus multicostatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
