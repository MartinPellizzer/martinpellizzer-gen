    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 macrochilum, commonly known as the giant spatiphyllum, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Due to its rarity in the wild, it is often propagated through tissue culture to ensure its survival and conservation."
