    "intro": "Saussurea kudoana, commonly known as the Japanese snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces small, pale yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate the plant in cold climates. Saussurea kudoana is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
