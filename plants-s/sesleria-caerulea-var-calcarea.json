    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the limestone regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to thrive in alkaline soils. The plant produces delicate blue to purple flower spikes in late spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
