    "intro": "Sporobolus latzii, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bract-like structures, which help in seed dispersal. Its seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, allowing the plant to spread across open landscapes. Sporobolus latzii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
