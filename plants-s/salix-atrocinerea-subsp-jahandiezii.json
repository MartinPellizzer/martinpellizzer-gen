    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea subsp. jahandiezii, commonly known as the black willow subspecies of Jahandiez, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dark, often blackish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
