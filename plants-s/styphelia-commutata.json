    "intro": "Styphelia commutata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its compact form. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dune environments. Styphelia commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
