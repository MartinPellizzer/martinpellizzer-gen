    "intro": "Stellaria palustris var. fennica, commonly known as the Fen starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments."
