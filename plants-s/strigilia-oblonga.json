    "intro": "Strigilia oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved strigilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, oblong leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stem. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Strigilia oblonga is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
