    "intro": "Salix sessilifolia var. vancouverensis, commonly known as Vancouver willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless and have a pointed tip. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. This variety is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats."
