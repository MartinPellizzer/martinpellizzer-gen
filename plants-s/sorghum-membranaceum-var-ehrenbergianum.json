    "intro": "Sorghum membranaceum var. ehrenbergianum, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a drought-tolerant grass that thrives in hot, dry climates with poor soil conditions. The plant typically grows as a tall annual, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, bluish-green leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers. This variety is valued for its resilience and has been used traditionally for forage, erosion control, and in some cases, as a source of food or fiber."
