    "intro": "Salix sphenophylla subsp. sphenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, woody fruits. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
