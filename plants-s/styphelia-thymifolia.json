    "intro": "Styphelia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of thyme, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Styphelia thymifolia is often found in heathland and sandplain environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
