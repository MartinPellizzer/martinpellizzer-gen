It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Salix tsoongii is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine."
