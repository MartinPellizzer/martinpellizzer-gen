    "intro": "Styloncerus demissus, commonly known as the slender ant-like beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae, which are commonly referred to as longhorned beetles. It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and a pair of long, antennae, which are typical features of the family. The beetle is primarily found in forested regions, where it inhabits decaying wood, playing a role in the decomposition process. Its botanical association is mainly with hardwood trees, where it lays its eggs in the bark or within the wood of host plants. The life cycle of Styloncerus demissus involves a larval stage that feeds on the wood, contributing to the natural breakdown of plant material in the ecosystem."
