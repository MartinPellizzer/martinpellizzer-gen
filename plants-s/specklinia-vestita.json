    "intro": "Specklinia vestita, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically appear in clusters, with a pale greenish-white coloration. Specklinia vestita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
