    "intro": "Selaginella pulvinata, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation. It is a small, evergreen, leafy plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a unique structure with specialized leaves that curl into a tight spiral when dry, allowing it to conserve moisture. When water becomes available, it rapidly rehydrates and regains its green color, a process known as revivification. This remarkable adaptation makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and a symbol of resilience in harsh conditions."
