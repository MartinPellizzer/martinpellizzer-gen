    "intro": "Salix acutifolia f. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are sharply pointed and have a rough, hairy texture. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath, with a distinct reddish or brownish midrib. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are primarily pollinated by wind. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
