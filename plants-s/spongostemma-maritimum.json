    "intro": "Spongostemma maritimum, commonly known as sea sponges or sea sponge grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in saline soils and is often found along rocky shores and dunes. Its unique morphology and adaptation to coastal conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
