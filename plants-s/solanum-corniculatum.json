    "intro": "Solanum corniculatum, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to South America and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped calyx that persists on the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
