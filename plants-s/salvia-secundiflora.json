    "intro": "Salvia secundiflora, commonly known as Mexican bush sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces spikes of showy violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
