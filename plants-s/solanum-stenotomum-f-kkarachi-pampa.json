    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. kkarachi-pampa, commonly known as the Karachi-Pampa nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to the high-altitude regions of Pakistan. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale purple, with five petals, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
