    "intro": "Solanum extuspellitum subsp. subcoeruleum, commonly known as the blue-flowered nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
