    "intro": "Sonchus laciniatus, commonly known as the cutleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate, deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Sonchus laciniatus is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
