It is a shrub characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that contain the toxic alkaloids typical of the Solanum genus. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina, and thrives in dry, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
