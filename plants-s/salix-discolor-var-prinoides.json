    "intro": "Salix discolor var. prinoides, commonly known as the white willow or the weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin strips, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its historical use in traditional medicine."
