    "intro": "Scleria tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slight sheen, while its inflorescence consists of multiple tiers of spikelets. Scleria tricuspidata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
