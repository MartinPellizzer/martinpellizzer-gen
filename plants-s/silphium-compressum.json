    "intro": "Silphium compressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact head, which bloom in late summer. Silphium compressum is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
