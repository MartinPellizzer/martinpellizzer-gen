    "intro": "Scleria pterota var. submelaleuca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and the margins of water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. The species is often found in the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia."
