    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 nitidissimum, commonly known as the hybrid giant orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a hybrid between Selenipedium albidum and Selenipedium nitidum, characterized by its large, showy, and often fragrant flowers. The plant is native to the cloud forests of Central America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It produces long, arching inflorescences with numerous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
