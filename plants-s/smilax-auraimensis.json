    "intro": "Smilax auraimensis, commonly known as the auraimensis arrowhead, is a species of climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stems and tendrils that allow it to climb and spread along vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are known to be somewhat toxic. Smilax auraimensis is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
