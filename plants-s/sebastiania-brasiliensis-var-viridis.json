It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its vibrant green seeds, which contrast with the darker seeds of other varieties."
