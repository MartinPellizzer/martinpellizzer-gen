    "intro": "Saxifraga muricola, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Saxifraga muricola is a hardy species that thrives in full sun and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas."
