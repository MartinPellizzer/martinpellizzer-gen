    "intro": "Stenocereus quevedonis, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a cactaceae plant native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains seeds, aiding in seed dispersal. Stenocereus quevedonis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its spiny structure."
