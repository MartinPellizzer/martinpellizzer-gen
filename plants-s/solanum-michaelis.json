    "intro": "Solanum michaelis, commonly known as the Michael's nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by egg-shaped berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to humans and animals."
