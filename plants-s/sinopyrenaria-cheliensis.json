    "intro": "Sinopyrenaria cheliensis, commonly known as the Cheli's sinopyrenaria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
