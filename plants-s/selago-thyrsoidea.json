    "intro": "Selago thyrsoidea, commonly known as the narrowleaf selago, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and pond margins. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Selago thyrsoidea is often found in wetland ecosystems and is considered an indicator species for disturbed or hydric habitats."
