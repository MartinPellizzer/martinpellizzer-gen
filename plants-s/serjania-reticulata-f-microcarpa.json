    "intro": "Serjania reticulata f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf serjania, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Serjaniaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, reticulate pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing minute seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
