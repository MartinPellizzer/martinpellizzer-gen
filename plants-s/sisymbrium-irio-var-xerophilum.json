It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas."
