    "intro": "Stenachaenium adenanthum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Stenachaenium adenanthum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
