    "intro": "Strychnos gracillima var. paucispinosa, commonly known as the slender-stalked strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Its fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
