    "intro": "Statice speciosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy or rocky soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Statice speciosa is also valued in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
