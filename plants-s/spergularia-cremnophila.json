    "intro": "Spergularia cremnophila, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal habitats in Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environments, such as cliffs and sea cliffs. Its leaves are often fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss. Spergularia cremnophila is often found in association with other halophytic species, thriving in saline and nutrient-poor conditions."
