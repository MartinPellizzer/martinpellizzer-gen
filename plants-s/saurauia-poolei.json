    "intro": "Saurauia poolei, commonly known as the Poole's saurauia, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in mountainous forests. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saurauia poolei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
