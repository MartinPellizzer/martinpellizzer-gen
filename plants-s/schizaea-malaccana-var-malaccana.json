    "intro": "Schizaea malaccana var. malaccana, commonly known as the Malacca clubmoss, is a terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms."
