It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are ovate with a distinctive truncate (cut-off) base, giving the plant its specific epithet. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. This variety is relatively hardy and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade."
