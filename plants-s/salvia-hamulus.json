    "intro": "Salvia hamulus, commonly known as the hookleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a slightly hooked appearance at the base. The plant produces spikes of showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple, violet, or blue, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Salvia hamulus is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
