    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the salt marsh bulrush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. This species thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, preventing erosion. The plant plays a crucial role in providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species."
