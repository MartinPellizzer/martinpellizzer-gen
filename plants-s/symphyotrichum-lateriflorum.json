It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy purple to blue-purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Symphyotrichum lateriflorum plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
