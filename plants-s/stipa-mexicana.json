    "intro": "Stipa mexicana, commonly known as Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Stipa mexicana is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
