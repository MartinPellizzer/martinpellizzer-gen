    "intro": "Stachys \u00d7 leucomalla, commonly known as the white lamb's ear, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that resembles lamb's wool, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to white flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its soft texture and delicate floral display."
