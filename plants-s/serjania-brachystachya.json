    "intro": "Serjania brachystachya, commonly known as the small-stalked serjania, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Serjaniae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in short inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
