    "intro": "Schismatoglottis ifugaoensis, commonly known as the Ifugao mountain orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
