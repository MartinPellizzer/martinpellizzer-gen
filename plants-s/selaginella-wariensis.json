    "intro": "Selaginella wariensis, commonly known as the variable spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released to propagate the plant. Selaginella wariensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
