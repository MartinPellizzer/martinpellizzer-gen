    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. aurea, commonly known as the golden mountain-ash, is a decorative shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is a cultivar of the common whitebeam, characterized by its striking golden foliage that turns a brilliant yellow in autumn. The plant features small, white flowers that appear in clusters during early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in late summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a hedge. The golden leaves provide year-round visual interest, making it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
