    "intro": "Sisymbrium columnae var. platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with instead modified stems that bear small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in siliquae, which are elongated, dry fruits that split open to release the seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
