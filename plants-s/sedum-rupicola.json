    "intro": "Sedum rupicola, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that help it store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-resistant plants."
