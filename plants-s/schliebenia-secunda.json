It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-yellow fruits that split open to release seeds. Schliebenia secunda is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
