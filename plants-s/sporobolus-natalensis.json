    "intro": "Sporobolus natalensis, commonly known as Natal grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Natal grass is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
