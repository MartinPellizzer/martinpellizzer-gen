    "intro": "Stangea calchaquina, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Stangea calchaquina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
