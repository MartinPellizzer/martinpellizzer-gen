    "intro": "Sarcogonum depressum, commonly known as the flat sarcogonum, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive, fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sarcogonum depressum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
