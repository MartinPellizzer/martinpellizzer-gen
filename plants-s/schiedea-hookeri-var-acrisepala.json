    "intro": "Schiedea hookeri var. acrisepala, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow-orange flowers, typically blooming once in its lifetime. It thrives in the high-elevation, volcanic soils of the Haleakal\u0101 Crater, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival due to habitat loss and invasive species."
