    "intro": "Sayeria woodsii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Sayeria woodsii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
