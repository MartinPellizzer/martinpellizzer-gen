    "intro": "Stelis aligera, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive pattern. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis aligera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
