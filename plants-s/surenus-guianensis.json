    "intro": "Surenus guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan surinus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, followed by the development of edible, coconut-like fruits. Surenus guianensis is often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
