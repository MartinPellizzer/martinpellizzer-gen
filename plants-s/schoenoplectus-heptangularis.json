    "intro": "Schoenoplectus heptangularis, commonly known as the seven-sided bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems that are typically seven-sided, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Schoenoplectus heptangularis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
