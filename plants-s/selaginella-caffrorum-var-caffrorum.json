    "intro": "Selaginella caffrorum var. caffrorum, commonly known as the Cape clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western Cape region, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dense, club-like clusters of leaves that resemble small, compact rosettes. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Selaginella caffrorum var. caffrorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is valued for its ability to thrive in semi-shade conditions."
