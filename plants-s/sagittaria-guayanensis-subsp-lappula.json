It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. Its flowering stems produce small, white flowers that are often clustered at the water's edge. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
