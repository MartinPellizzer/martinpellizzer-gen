    "intro": "Silene alexandrina, commonly known as the Alexandrine campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pink to purple flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Silene alexandrina is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
