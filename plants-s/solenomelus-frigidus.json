    "intro": "Solenomelus frigidus, commonly known as the cold-weather solenomelus, is a rare plant species adapted to harsh, cold climates. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with limited sunlight and low temperatures. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss and protect against frost. Due to its specialized habitat, Solenomelus frigidus is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
