It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife. Its botanical features make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
