It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral morphology, featuring showy, lip-like petals. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forest ecosystems. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, highlighting its ecological significance within its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
