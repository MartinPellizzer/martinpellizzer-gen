    "intro": "Stachys palustris, commonly known as swamp betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with rough textures. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported calming and sedative properties. Stachys palustris thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
