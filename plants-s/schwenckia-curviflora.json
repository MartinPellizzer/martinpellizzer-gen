    "intro": "Schwenckia curviflora, commonly known as the curly-flower false dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, curving flower heads that resemble those of dandelions. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Schwenckia curviflora produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal."
