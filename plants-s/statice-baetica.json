    "intro": "Statice baetica, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice baetica is widely cultivated as a ornamental plant for its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
