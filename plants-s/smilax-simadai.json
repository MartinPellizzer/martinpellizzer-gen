    "intro": "Smilax simadai, commonly known as the Chinese arrowroot or Chinese smilax, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features a robust, woody stem with thorns and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible. Smilax simadai is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
