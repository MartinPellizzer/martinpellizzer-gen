It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and aesthetic appeal make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
