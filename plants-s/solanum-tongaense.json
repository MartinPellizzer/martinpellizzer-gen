    "intro": "Solanum tongaense, commonly known as Tonga nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers."
