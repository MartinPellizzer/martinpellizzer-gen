    "intro": "Sideroxylon cuspidatum var. ellipticum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, glossy bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
