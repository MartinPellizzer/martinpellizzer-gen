    "intro": "Selliguea craspedosora, commonly known as the hairy rock moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming plant that typically grows on rocky surfaces, especially in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy appearance, with leaf-like structures that are often curled or crinkled. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Selliguea craspedosora is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of forest floor ecosystems."
