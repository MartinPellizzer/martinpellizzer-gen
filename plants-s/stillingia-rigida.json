    "intro": "Stillingia rigida, commonly known as red root, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its reddish-brown roots, which are the source of its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. Stillingia rigida is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling and use."
