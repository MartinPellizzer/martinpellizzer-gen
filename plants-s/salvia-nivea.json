    "intro": "Salvia nivea, commonly known as the snow sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-white bloom of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to white, which bloom in late summer. Salvia nivea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
