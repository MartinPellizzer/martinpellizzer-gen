    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum diguanum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the dense, humid undergrowth of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that emit a faint bioluminescent glow during the night, a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators in low-light conditions. The plant's leaves are covered in fine, translucent scales that help retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf sheaths, ensuring protection until the right environmental conditions trigger spore release. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum diguanum remains a subject of scientific fascination and conservation concern."
