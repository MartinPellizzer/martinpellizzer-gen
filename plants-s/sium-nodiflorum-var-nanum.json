    "intro": "Sium nodiflorum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf water pepper, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter, arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces tiny, white flowers in clusters, which are often submerged or floating on the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its compact size and aquatic habitat, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for aquatic organisms."
