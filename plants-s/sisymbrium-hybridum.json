    "intro": "Sisymbrium hybridum, commonly known as wild radish, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a taproot system with a basal rosette of leaves that are usually lobed or deeply divided. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds. Sisymbrium hybridum is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
