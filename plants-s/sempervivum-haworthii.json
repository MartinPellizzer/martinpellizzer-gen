    "intro": "Sempervivum haworthii, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating called farina. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Sempervivum haworthii is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
