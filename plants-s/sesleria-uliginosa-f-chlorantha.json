    "intro": "Sesleria uliginosa f. chlorantha, commonly known as the green form of the bog sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to moist, acidic habitats in Europe. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, bright green leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, adding subtle visual interest. This form is distinguished by its consistently green foliage, which contrasts with the more typical silver-green coloration of the species. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in heathland and woodland margins."
