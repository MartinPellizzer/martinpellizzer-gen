    "intro": "Smyrnium perfoliatum, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple hue. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply cut and can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if handled without proper protection."
