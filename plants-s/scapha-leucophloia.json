    "intro": "Scapha leucophloia, commonly known as the white phloem orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with white petals and sepals, and a yellowish lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scapha leucophloia is considered a vulnerable species."
