    "intro": "Sedum fasciculare, commonly known as stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an excellent choice for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a hardy and easy-to-maintain ornamental plant."
