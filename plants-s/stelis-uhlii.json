It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the Andes. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Stelis uhlii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich substrates for optimal growth."
