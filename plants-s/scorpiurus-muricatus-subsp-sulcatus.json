    "intro": "Scorpiurus muricatus subsp. sulcatus, commonly known as the smooth scurvygrass, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and has a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate or ascending stems. The leaves are narrowly linear, often with a slightly wavy or serrated margin, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. This species is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a characteristic component of coastal vegetation."
