    "intro": "Sabina knightii, commonly known as the Knight's juniper, is a rare and endangered species native to the southwestern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree with scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and limestone areas. Due to habitat loss, Sabina knightii is listed as threatened, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
