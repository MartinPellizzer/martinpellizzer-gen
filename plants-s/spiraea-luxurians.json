It is characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and dark green, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraea luxurians prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
