It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that store water. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, including salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits containing seeds. This variant is native to southern Africa and is an important component of its coastal ecosystems."
