    "intro": "Sobralia rosea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive velvety texture. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in a branching pattern from the base. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette formation. Sobralia rosea thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
