    "intro": "Statice bicolor, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its slender, grass-like leaves are typically blue-gray in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Statice bicolor is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements."
