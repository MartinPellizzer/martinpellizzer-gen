    "intro": "Salvia officinalis f. multiverticillata, commonly known as the multifork sage, is a botanical variant of the common sage plant. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched inflorescences that give it a unique appearance compared to the typical salvia species. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit and produces smaller, more numerous flower clusters. The leaves are typically gray-green with a slightly fuzzy texture, typical of the Salvia genus. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has potential uses in herbal medicine due to its aromatic properties."
