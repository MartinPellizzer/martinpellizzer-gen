    "intro": "Synaphea spinulosa subsp. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny synaphea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, spiny stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, and the stems bear small, sharp spines for protection. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in dry climates."
