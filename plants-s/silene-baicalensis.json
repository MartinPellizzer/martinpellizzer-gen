    "intro": "Silene baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. Silene baicalensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
