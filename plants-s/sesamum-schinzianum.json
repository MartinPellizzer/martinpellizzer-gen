    "intro": "Sesamum schinzianum, commonly known as the Schinz's sesame, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its genus."
