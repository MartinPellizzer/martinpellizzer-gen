    "intro": "Siphocampylus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive two-toned appearance. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, seed-like fruits called achenes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Siphocampylus bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
