    "intro": "Sulettaria stoloniflora, commonly known as the creeping lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Sulettaria stoloniflora is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
