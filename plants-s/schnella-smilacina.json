    "intro": "Schnella smilacina, commonly known as the climbing smilacine, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow up to 10 inches in length, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. Schnella smilacina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover structures or trellises."
