    "intro": "Stenandrium harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's stenandrium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forest canopies. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
