    "intro": "Sansevieria dhofarica, commonly known as the Dhofar sansevieria, is a succulent plant native to the southern Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically light green with faint, wavy margins. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that store water efficiently. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stems, which appear during the warmer months. Due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
