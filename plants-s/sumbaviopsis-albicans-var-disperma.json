    "intro": "Sumbaviopsis albicans var. disperma, commonly known as the white-flowered sumbaviopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
