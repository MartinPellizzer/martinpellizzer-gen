    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia var. obtusocuneata, commonly known as the blunt-angled saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green hue and a waxy texture. Its flowering stems bear small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings."
