    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form tubular traps with a distinctive red coloration and a darker central stripe. The plant produces nectar to lure insects into its pitcher-shaped leaves, where they are digested by digestive enzymes. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and requires high humidity and ample sunlight. This form is notable for its unique leaf morphology, which differs from the more common S. purpurea var. purpurea."
