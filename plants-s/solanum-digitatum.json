    "intro": "Solanum digitatum, commonly known as the starfruit or carambola, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruit. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered, while the fruit develops from a single ovary and turns yellow to orange when mature. The fruit is edible, with a tangy, acidic flavor and a crisp texture, making it a popular tropical fruit in many regions."
