    "intro": "Selinum eryngiifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its salty, windy environment. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are spiny and resemble the leaves of the eryngo plant, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or seaside cliffs. Selinum eryngiifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
