    "intro": "Sanchezia, commonly known as the \"Bottle Tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Central and South America, as well as parts of Southeast Asia. They are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems that store water, making them drought-tolerant. Sanchezia species often have showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and may have a velvety texture, adding to their ornamental appeal."
