It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a berry that turns red when mature, and it contains toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshades.
