    "intro": "Scaevola paludosa, commonly known as the marsh scaevola, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. Scaevola paludosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and marshy habitats. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
