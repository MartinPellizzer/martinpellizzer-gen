It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems that are dark brown to black in color. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are typical of willow species. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
