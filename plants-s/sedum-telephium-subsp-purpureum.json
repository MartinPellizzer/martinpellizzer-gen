    "intro": "Sedum telephium subsp. purpureum, commonly known as Crimson Bladder Campion, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. It has a low-growing habit and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its common name reflects the presence of bladder-like structures in its leaves, which help it store water."
