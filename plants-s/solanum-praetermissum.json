    "intro": "Solanum praetermissum, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, green to yellowish fruits that are typically harvested when they are still firm. Its leaves are hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Solanum praetermissum is valued for its resilience and potential use in traditional medicine and as a food source."
