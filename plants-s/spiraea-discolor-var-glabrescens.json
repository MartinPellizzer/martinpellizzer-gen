    "intro": "Spiraea discolor var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth meadow spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, glabrous texture, which gives the variety its name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
