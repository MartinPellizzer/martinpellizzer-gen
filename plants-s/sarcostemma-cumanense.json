    "intro": "Sarcostemma cumanense, commonly known as the Cumanese milkvine, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive milky sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in tropical and subtropical regions. Sarcostemma cumanense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
