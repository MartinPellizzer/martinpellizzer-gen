    "intro": "Sinocarum bijiangense, commonly known as the Bijiang sinocarum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and sometimes edible berries. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with simple, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
