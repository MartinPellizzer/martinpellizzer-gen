    "intro": "Staelia scabra, commonly known as the rough staelia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and bogs of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and it has hairy, wiry stems and leaves. Staelia scabra thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy or swampy environments. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
