    "intro": "Spermacoce parviflora, commonly known as smallflower moonvine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Spermacoce parviflora is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
