    "intro": "Sisyranthus schizoglossoides, commonly known as the pink-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
