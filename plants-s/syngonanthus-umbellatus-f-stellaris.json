    "intro": "Syngonanthus umbellatus f. stellaris, commonly known as the star-flowered false heather, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive inflorescences, which consist of clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems, giving the plant a unique, architectural appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
