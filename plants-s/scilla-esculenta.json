    "intro": "Scilla esculenta, commonly known as the giant squill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features strap-like, grassy leaves that form a basal rosette and produces striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers in spring. The plant is characterized by its large, bulbous underground storage organ, which is used as a food source in some regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Scilla esculenta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible parts, though it may be toxic if consumed raw."
