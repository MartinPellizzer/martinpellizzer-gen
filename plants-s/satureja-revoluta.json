It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are used in cooking for their fragrant, thyme-like aroma.
