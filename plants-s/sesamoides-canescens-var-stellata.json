    "intro": "Sesamoides canescens var. stellata, commonly known as starry sesamoid, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that are arranged in star-like clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
