    "intro": "Sedum victorianum, commonly known as the Victorian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Sedum victorianum is also known for its ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
