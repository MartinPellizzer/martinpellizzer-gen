    "intro": "Senegalia berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. Senegalia berlandieri is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
