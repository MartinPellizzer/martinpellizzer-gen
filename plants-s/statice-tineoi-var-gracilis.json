    "intro": "Statice tineoi var. gracilis, commonly known as slender sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for maritime environments. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
