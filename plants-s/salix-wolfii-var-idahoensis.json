    "intro": "Salix wolfii var. idahoensis, commonly known as the Idaho willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species for stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local wildlife."
