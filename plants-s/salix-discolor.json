    "intro": "Salix discolor, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender branches, grayish bark, and pairs of opposite leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, white down, giving the plant its common name."
