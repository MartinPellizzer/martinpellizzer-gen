    "intro": "Salix subdentosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are narrowly tapered and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers arranged separately on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix subdentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or arid landscapes."
