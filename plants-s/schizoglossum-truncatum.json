It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its leaves are linear and often have a truncate or notched tip, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Schizoglossum truncatum is characterized by its delicate floral structure and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids."
