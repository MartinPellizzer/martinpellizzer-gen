    "intro": "Siderasis acaulis, commonly known as the stemless ironweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Siderasis acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
