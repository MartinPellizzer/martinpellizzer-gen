    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a finely toothed margin, often turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
