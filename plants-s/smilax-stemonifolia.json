    "intro": "Smilax stemonifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively through underground stems. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Smilax stemonifolia is known for its strong, sharp spines along its stems and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
