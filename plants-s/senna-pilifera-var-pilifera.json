    "intro": "Senna pilifera var. pilifera, commonly known as the silky senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its seeds are encased in a long, slender pod and are used in traditional medicine. Senna pilifera var. pilifera thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
