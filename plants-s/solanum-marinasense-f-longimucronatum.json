    "intro": "Solanum marinasense f. longimucronatum, commonly known as the long-tipped nightshade, is a botanical variant of the Solanum marinasense species. It is characterized by its elongated, acuminate calyx lobes, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a glossy surface and serrated margins. The flowers are typically white or pale purple, with a distinctive, elongated stigma that contributes to its unique appearance."
