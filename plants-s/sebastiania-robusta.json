    "intro": "Sebastiania robusta, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
