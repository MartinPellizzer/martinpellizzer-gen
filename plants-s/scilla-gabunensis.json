    "intro": "Scilla gabunensis, commonly known as Gabon squill, is a bulbous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a unique addition to woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
