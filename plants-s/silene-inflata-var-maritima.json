    "intro": "Silene inflata var. maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, inflated seed pods that resemble small, inflated balloons, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and windy environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
