    "intro": "Sida meloana, commonly known as the African mallow, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 1 to 2 meters tall, with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Sida meloana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
