    "intro": "Sclerocactus unguispinus var. durangensis, commonly known as the Durango prickly pear, is a cactus native to the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
