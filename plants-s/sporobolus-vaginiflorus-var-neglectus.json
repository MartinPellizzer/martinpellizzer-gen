    "intro": "Sporobolus vaginiflorus var. neglectus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in bristly glumes, aiding in its adaptation to dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is an important component of desert and grassland ecosystems."
