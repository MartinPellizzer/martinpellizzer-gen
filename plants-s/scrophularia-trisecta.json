    "intro": "Scrophularia trisecta, commonly known as three-lobed figwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or pink. Scrophularia trisecta is often found in damp soils and can be a valuable plant for supporting local pollinators."
