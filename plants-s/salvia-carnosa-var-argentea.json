    "intro": "Salvia carnosa var. argentea, commonly known as silver sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
