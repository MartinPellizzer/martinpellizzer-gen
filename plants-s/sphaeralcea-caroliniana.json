It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea caroliniana is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
