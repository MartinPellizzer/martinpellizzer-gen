    "intro": "Sorbus subeminens, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly waxy texture. Sorbus subeminens is often found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates."
