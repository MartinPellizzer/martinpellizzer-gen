It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble spectacles. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters, producing a vibrant display of colors that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
