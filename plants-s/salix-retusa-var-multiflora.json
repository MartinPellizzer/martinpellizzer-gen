    "intro": "Salix retusa var. multiflora, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize riverbanks make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
