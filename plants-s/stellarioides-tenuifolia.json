    "intro": "Stellarioides tenuifolia, commonly known as slender starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its delicate, grass-like appearance. Stellarioides tenuifolia is generally non-invasive and plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
