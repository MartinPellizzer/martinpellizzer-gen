    "intro": "Specklinia hygrophila, commonly known as the water fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. Specklinia hygrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
