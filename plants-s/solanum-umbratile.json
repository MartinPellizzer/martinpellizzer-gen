    "intro": "Solanum umbratile, commonly known as the shadow nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from green to red, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other solanum species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
