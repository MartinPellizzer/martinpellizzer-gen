It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, adapting to the harsh maritime environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
