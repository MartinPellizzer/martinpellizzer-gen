    "intro": "Salicornia perennans, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in coastal environments with high salinity. It is a succulent perennial that forms dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically inconspicuous and arranged in clusters. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are rich in moisture, allowing it to store water efficiently. Salicornia perennans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
