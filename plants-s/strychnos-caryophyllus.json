    "intro": "Strychnos caryophyllus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Tanzania and Kenya. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and woody, aromatic seeds. Its bark and seeds contain toxic alkaloids, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
