    "intro": "Sarcochilus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, waxy appearance. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
