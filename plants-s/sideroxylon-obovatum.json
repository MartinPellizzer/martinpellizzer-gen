It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Sideroxylon obovatum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
