    "intro": "Sarcostemma undulatum, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is often toxic. Sarcostemma undulatum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for certain insects and animals."
