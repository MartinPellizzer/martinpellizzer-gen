    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 norica, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
