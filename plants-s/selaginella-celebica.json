    "intro": "Selaginella celebica, commonly known as the Celebes spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the ends of the stems. Selaginella celebica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
