    "intro": "Sorbus arranensis subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the Arran whitebeam, is a rare subspecies native to the Scottish island of Arran. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
