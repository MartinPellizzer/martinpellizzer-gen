    "intro": "Sedum lenkoranicum, commonly known as the Lenkoran stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum lenkoranicum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
