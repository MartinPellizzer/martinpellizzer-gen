    "intro": "Salix ohsidare, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has small, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The bark is typically smooth and may have a reddish or greyish hue depending on the age of the plant."
