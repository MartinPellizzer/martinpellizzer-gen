    "intro": "Senecio retanensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in arid and coastal environments. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters during the rainy season, typically from October to December. Senecio retanensis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various desert organisms."
