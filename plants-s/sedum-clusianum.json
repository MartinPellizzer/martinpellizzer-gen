    "intro": "Sedum clusianum, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, upright stems that often bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
