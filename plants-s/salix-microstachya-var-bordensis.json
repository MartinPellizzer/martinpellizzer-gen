    "intro": "Salix microstachya var. bordensis, commonly known as the Baltic willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy or muddy soils along shorelines. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
