It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has finely cut, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Spiraea japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its delicate floral display."
