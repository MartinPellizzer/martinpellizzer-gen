It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with stems typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually green to purplish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. This variety is often cultivated for its edible grains and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
