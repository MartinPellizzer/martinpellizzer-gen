    "intro": "Selliguea plantaginea, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thallus that is green and often covered with a layer of fine, white rhizoids. Its structure consists of a prostrate stem with upright leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Selliguea plantaginea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
