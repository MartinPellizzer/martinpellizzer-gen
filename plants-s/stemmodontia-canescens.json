    "intro": "Stemmodontia canescens, commonly known as the silverstem or silverleaf plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features a woody stem covered in a dense layer of silvery, glandular hairs that give it its common name. The leaves are narrow, linear, and also adorned with the same silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
