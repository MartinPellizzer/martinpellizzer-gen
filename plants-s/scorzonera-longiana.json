It features upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by cylindrical, spiny seed pods. Its root system is notable for being thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine. Scorzonera longiana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky or sandy gardens."
