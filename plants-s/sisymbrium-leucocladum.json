It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces pods that contain several small, round seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and seed dispersal research."
