    "intro": "Solanum heterodoxum var. heterodoxum, commonly known as the heterodox nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
