    "intro": "Styrax pulverulentus, commonly known as the powdered styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous tiny, dark seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Styrax pulverulentus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
