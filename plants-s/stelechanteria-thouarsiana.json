    "intro": "Stelechanteria thouarsiana, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It features a distinctive, branching stem structure with cylindrical, ribbed segments that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
