    "intro": "Scleromitrion linoides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Scleromitrion linoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
