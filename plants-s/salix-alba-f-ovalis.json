    "intro": "Salix alba f. ovalis, commonly known as the oval willow, is a hybrid form of the white willow. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly oval in appearance. This cultivar is typically found in wetland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
