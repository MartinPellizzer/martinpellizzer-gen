    "intro": "Stevia leptophylla, commonly known as sweet leaf or sugar leaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are harvested and used as a natural sweetener, making it a popular alternative to sugar in various culinary and medicinal applications."
