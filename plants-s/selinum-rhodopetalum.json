    "intro": "Selinum rhodopetalum, commonly known as the pink rock aster, is a flowering plant native to the rocky areas of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in dry, open habitats such as gravelly slopes and sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
