    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. scandica, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in corymbs, followed by edible, red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often used in hedgerows and woodland areas."
