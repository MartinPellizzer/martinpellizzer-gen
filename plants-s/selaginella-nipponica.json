    "intro": "Selaginella nipponica, commonly known as Japanese spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Selaginella nipponica reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is often found in temperate regions of East Asia. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
