    "intro": "Salix alaxensis var. alaxensis, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks, stream sides, and wetlands. The plant features slender, often multi-stemmed branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
