    "intro": "Solanum multiglandulosum var. multiarmatum, commonly known as the multiarmed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with numerous glands, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
