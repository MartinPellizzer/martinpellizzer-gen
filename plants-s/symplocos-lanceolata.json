    "intro": "Symplocos lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Symplocos lanceolata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species for wildlife, particularly for birds that consume its berries."
