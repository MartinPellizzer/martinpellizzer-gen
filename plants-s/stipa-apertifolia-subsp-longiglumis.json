    "intro": "Stipa apertifolia subsp. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are loosely arranged along the stem. Its flowers are typically small and wind-pollinated, with lemma and palea structures that are often hairy or bristly. This subspecies is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
