    "intro": "Sonchus racemosus, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a tall, branched stem with alternate, serrated leaves that become smaller toward the top. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a raceme, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural fields."
