    "intro": "Saxifraga colchica, commonly known as the Armenian saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, which help it conserve moisture. Its flowers are small, pink to red, and arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Saxifraga colchica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
