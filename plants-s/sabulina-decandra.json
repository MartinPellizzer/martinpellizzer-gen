It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arctic or alpine regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient conditions. Sabulina decandra plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats."
