It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Stipa castellanosii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
