It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, strap-like leaves that form dense, low-growing clusters. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores. Scolopendrium septentrionale plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
