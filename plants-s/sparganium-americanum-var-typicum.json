    "intro": "Sparganium americanum var. typicum, commonly known as American burr rush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that bear clusters of spiny, cone-like structures at the top. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of lakes, ponds, and streams. Its spiky inflorescences serve as a distinctive feature and aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
