    "intro": "Senecio hatcherianus, commonly known as the Hatcher's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a woolly texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
