It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and smooth, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
