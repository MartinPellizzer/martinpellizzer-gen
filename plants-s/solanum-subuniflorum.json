    "intro": "Solanum subuniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and solitary, showy flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
