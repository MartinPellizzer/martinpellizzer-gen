    "intro": "Salix arbutifolia var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often tinged with reddish hues in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
