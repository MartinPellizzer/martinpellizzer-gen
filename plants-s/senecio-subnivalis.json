    "intro": "Senecio subnivalis, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, cold environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
