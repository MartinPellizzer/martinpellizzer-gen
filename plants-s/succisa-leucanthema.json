    "intro": "Succisa leucanthema, commonly known as white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight."
