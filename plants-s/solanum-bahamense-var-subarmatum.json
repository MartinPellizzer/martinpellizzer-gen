    "intro": "Solanum bahamense var. subarmatum, commonly known as the Bahamian nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, slightly lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow berries that mature in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires caution when handling."
