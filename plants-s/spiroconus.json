It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence, which resembles a cone and is composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is native to regions of North America. Spiroconus species are often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where they thrive in humid conditions. Their striking appearance makes them a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
