    "intro": "Sagina baumgartenii, commonly known as the mountain sagina, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and tiny, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is a perennial species that spreads through stolons, forming dense cushions that help prevent soil erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
