    "intro": "Saponaria \u00d7 laeta, commonly known as the foamy balm or woolly betony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Saponaria ocymifolia and Saponaria versicolor. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its sap contains saponins, which can produce a frothy lather when mixed with water, giving it its common name."
