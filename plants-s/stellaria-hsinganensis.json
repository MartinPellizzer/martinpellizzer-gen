    "intro": "Stellaria hsinganensis, commonly known as the Hsingan starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many species with distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Stellaria hsinganensis is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
