    "intro": "Stevia chamaedrys var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular stevia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slight sweet scent, though they are not as intensely sweet as other stevia varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders."
