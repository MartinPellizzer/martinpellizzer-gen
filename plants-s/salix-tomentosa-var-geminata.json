    "intro": "Salix tomentosa var. geminata, commonly known as the silver willow or twinleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its growth habit includes a multi-stemmed form with a spreading crown, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting."
