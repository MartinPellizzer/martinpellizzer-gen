    "intro": "Sterculia aerisperma, commonly known as the woolly sterculia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, hairy coating. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common species in degraded tropical forests."
