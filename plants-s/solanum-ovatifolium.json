    "intro": "Solanum ovatifolium, commonly known as the ovate-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its ovate, broad leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. Its fruits are berries that change color from green to yellow or red as they mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
