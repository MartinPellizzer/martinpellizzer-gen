    "intro": "Salix polyadenia, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a woolly appearance. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellowish-green and appear in the spring. This plant thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
