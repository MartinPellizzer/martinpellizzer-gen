    "intro": "Schefflera gabriellae, commonly known as the Gabriella's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of large, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact, circular pattern at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by round, green fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
