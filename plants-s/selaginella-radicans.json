    "intro": "Selaginella radicans, commonly known as the spreading clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls along its stems, which are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Selaginella radicans is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
