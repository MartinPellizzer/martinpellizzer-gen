    "intro": "Shorea roxburghii, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and smooth, pale grey bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and is valued for its durable, heavy timber used in construction and furniture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species."
