    "intro": "Synostemon rhytidospermus, commonly known as the rough-seeded synostemon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and butterflies. The rough texture of its seeds, as suggested by its scientific name, contributes to its unique botanical features."
