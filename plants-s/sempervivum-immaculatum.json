    "intro": "Sempervivum immaculatum, commonly known as the silver rose or white hens and chicks, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its compact growth habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
