    "intro": "Symplocos confusa, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or Chinese wax tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often reddish or purplish when young. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Symplocos confusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
