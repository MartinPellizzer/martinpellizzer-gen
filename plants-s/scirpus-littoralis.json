    "intro": "Scirpus littoralis, commonly known as saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and it produces spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to form dense stands that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus littoralis plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
