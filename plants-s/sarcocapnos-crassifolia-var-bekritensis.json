    "intro": "Sarcocapnos crassifolia var. bekritensis, commonly known as the Bekrit thornapple, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
