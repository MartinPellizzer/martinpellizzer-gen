It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with prominent, arcuate veins that give it its common name. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Syzygium arcuatinervium is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
