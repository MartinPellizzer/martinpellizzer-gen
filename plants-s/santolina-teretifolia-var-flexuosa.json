    "intro": "Santolina teretifolia var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible silver sage, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of silver-gray, needle-like leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are typically borne in compact, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and aromatic foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
