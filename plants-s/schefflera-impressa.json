It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like crown composed of multiple branches that radiate from a central trunk. The leaves are typically glossy, dark green, and have a distinctive palmate shape with five to seven lobes. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
