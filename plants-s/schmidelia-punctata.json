    "intro": "Schmidelia punctata, commonly known as the spotted schmidelia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals. Schmidelia punctata thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
