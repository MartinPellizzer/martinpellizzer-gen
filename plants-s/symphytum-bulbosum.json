    "intro": "Symphytum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and tubers that store nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, fertile soils. The plant produces erect stems with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along streambanks. Due to its high nutrient content, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a soil amendment."
