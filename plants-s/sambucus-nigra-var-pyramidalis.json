    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, dark purple berries. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and has a pyramidal shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed in moderation due to their potential toxicity when unripe."
