    "intro": "Sporobolus uniglumis, commonly known as the single-awned spikerush, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has slender, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with single awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a tough, fibrous texture adapted to withstand drought conditions. Sporobolus uniglumis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
