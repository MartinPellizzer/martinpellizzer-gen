    "intro": "Saxifraga rivularis subsp. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in moist, rocky environments and has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Saxifraga rivularis subsp. hyperborea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
