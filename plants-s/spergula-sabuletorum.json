    "intro": "Spergula sabuletorum, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal areas of Europe. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in dune environments. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among grasses. Spergula sabuletorum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
