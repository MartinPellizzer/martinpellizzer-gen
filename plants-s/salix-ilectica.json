    "intro": "Salix ilectica, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix ilectica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wet meadows. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
