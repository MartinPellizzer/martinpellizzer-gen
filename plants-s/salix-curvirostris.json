    "intro": "Salix curvirostris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and precede the leaves in most cases. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other damp habitats. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
