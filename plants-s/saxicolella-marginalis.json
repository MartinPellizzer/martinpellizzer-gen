    "intro": "Saxicolella marginalis, commonly known as the marginal saxicolella, is a rare and specialized lithophytic plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It thrives on exposed rock surfaces, where it relies on minimal soil and abundant sunlight for survival. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to endure arid conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Saxicolella marginalis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
