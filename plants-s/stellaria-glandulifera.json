    "intro": "Stellaria glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in its identification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Stellaria glandulifera is often found in temperate climates and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
