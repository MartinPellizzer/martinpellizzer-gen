    "intro": "Solanum gilesii, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that resemble those of the common nightshade. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with smooth, waxy leaves and yellowish-white flowers. Solanum gilesii is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry forests, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing various alkaloids that can cause severe poisoning if ingested."
