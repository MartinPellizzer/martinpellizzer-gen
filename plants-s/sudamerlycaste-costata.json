    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste costata, commonly known as the Brazilian shield fern, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are leathery and have a serrated margin, which helps in water retention in humid environments. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
