    "intro": "Sibbaldia procumbens var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
