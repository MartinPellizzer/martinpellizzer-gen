    "intro": "Sarcocornia mossiana, commonly known as the salt marsh grass or sea lavender, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has succulent leaves that store water and reduce water loss, aiding in its survival in arid or salty conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or purple, contributing to its ornamental value. Sarcocornia mossiana plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
