    "intro": "Siolmatra brasiliensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the Brazilian velvet fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the humid rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical environment. The plant typically grows as a low-lying groundcover, with slender, creeping stems that form dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
