    "intro": "Smilax globulifera, commonly known as the globular smilax, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and anchor to supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by the development of red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture and are often covered in fine, white hairs. Smilax globulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
