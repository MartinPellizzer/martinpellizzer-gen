    "intro": "Stelis damianii, commonly known as the Damian's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis damianii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
