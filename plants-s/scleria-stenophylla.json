    "intro": "Scleria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scleria stenophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
