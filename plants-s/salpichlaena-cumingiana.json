    "intro": "Salpichlaena cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's spiky fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, spiky fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
