    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. vulgaris, commonly known as European elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its bark is smooth and grayish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The berries are edible when ripe but are toxic when unripe, making careful identification essential for safe consumption."
