    "intro": "Sedum rosea var. microphyllum, commonly known as the miniature pink stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically tinged with pink or red hues, especially under intense sunlight. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. This variety is prized in rock gardens and xeriscaping for its compact form and vibrant color."
