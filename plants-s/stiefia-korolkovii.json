    "intro": "Stiefia korolkovii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Black Sea. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Stiefia korolkovii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along rocky shores or in dunes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
