    "intro": "Scurrula incarnata, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in arid landscape designs."
