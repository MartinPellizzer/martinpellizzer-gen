These plants are characterized by their distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, a feature that gives them their common name. Silicularia species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in well-drained soils. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and contribute to ecological diversity in their native habitats."
