    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 australior, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female, facilitating wind pollination. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Native to the eastern United States, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources."
