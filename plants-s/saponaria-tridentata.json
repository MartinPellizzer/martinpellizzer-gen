It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed at the base, giving it its common name. Saponaria tridentata is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its flowers produce a mild soap-like substance, which has been historically used for cleaning purposes."
