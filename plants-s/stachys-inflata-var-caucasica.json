    "intro": "Stachys inflata var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian inflated hedgehog. This perennial herb is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It features distinctive, inflated, spiny bracts that resemble small, inflated balloons, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with full sun and good drainage."
