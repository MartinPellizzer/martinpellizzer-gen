It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
