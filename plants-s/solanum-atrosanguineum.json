    "intro": "Solanum atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that start green and ripen to a deep black. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing solanine and other alkaloids. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
