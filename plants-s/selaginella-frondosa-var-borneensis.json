    "intro": "Selaginella frondosa var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors in tropical regions. The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is native to Borneo and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
