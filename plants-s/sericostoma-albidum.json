    "intro": "Sericostoma albidum, commonly known as the white sericostoma, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The reproductive structures are complex, with showy petals and specialized pollination mechanisms that attract specific insect pollinators."
