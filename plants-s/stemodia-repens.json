It features slender, branching stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This plant is typically found in moist, sandy soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
