    "intro": "Sophora rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves with a rounded base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
