    "intro": "Strobilacanthus, commonly known as the spike gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical fruits that resemble a spike, hence its scientific name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a hairy surface. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms on the same plant, a feature typical of many cucurbit species."
