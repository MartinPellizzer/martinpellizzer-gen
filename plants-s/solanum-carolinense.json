    "intro": "Solanum carolinense, commonly known as the Carolina nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture and hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to both humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides."
