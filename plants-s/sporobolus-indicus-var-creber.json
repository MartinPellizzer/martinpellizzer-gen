    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus var. creber, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and fine, bluish-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes contributes to its resilience and adaptability in arid environments."
