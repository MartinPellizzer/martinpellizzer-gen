    "intro": "Scabiosa elata, commonly known as the skyrocket scabiosa, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa elata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
