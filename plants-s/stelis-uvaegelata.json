    "intro": "Stelis uvaegelata, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis uvaegelata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique growth habits."
