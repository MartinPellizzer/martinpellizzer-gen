    "intro": "Salix viminalis var. opaca, commonly known as black willow or opaca willow, is a variant of the weeping willow that is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. This plant typically grows near water sources such as rivers and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its catkin flowers are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
