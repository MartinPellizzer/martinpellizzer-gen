It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure with three distinct lobes on each leaf, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, intricate morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Selliguea trisecta is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
