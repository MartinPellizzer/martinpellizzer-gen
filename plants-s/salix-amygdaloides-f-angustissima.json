    "intro": "Salix amygdaloides f. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weeping willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green on the upper surface and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along streams. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its graceful appearance."
