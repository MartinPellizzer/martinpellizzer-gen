    "intro": "Sida advena, commonly known as the common mallow, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface, often covered in glandular trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Sida advena is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
