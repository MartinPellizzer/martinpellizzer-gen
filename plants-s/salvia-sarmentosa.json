    "intro": "Salvia sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Salvia sarmentosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils."
