    "intro": "Senecio myrtifolius, commonly known as the African Daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
