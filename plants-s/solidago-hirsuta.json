    "intro": "Solidago hirsuta, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has rough, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Solidago hirsuta plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
