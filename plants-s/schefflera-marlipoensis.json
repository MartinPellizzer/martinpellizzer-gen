    "intro": "Schefflera marlipoensis, commonly known as the Marlipo schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera marlipoensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
