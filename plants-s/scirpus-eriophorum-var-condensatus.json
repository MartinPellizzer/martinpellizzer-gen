    "intro": "Scirpus eriophorum var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spikelike inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in phytoremediation."
