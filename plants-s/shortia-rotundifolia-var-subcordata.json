    "intro": "Shortia rotundifolia var. subcordata, commonly known as the broadleaf shortia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring rich, acidic soil. Its foliage is often described as having a distinctive broad, heart-shaped base, which gives it its varietal name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
