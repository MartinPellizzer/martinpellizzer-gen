    "intro": "Serratula chamaepeuce, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
