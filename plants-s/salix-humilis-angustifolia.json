    "intro": "Salix humilis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
