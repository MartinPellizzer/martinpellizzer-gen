    "intro": "Sisymbrium vestitum, commonly known as the hairy mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are small and contain compounds that can be used in traditional medicine, though the plant itself is often considered a weed."
