It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its large, waxy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
