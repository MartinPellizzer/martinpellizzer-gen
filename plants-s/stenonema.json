    "intro": "Stenonema, commonly known as the \"false brooklime,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. These plants are typically small herbs with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. They produce clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Stenonema species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Their botanical features make them distinctive members of the Plantaginaceae family, with adaptations suited to their wetland habitats."
