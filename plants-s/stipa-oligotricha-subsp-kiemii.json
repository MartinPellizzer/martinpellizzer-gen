    "intro": "Stipa oligotricha subsp. kiemii, commonly known as the Kiem's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies."
