It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural settings."
