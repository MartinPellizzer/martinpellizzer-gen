    "intro": "Scilla verna var. odorata, commonly known as the sweet scilla, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant produces strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and is typically found in woodland habitats. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The variety 'odorata' is distinguished by its stronger fragrance compared to other scilla species."
