    "intro": "Salix lucida subsp. lasiandra, commonly known as slender willow, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Its growth habit and habitat preferences make it an important species for wetland ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender form compared to other members of the Salix lucida complex."
