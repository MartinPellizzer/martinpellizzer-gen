    "intro": "Stelis sesquipedalis, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees and wasps, which are attracted by its strong fragrance. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Stelis sesquipedalis is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
