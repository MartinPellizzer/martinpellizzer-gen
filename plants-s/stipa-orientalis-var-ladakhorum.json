    "intro": "Stipa orientalis var. ladakhorum, commonly known as the Ladakh needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant typically blooms with spikelets that bear small, pale green to brown florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
