    "intro": "Stevia lita, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is well-known for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. Stevia lita is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant suitable for various climates. Its use as a natural sweetener has gained popularity due to its low caloric content and health benefits."
