    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 viridis, commonly known as the green willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix caprea and Salix triandra. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on both sides. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The green willow is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
