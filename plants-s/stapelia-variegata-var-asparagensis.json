It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow\u82b1\u6735 with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. This variety is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
