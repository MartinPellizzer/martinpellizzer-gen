    "intro": "Stelis falcifera, commonly known as the sickle-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features lanceolate, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are often dark green and glossy. Its flowers are typically small, clustered, and come in shades of white or pale yellow, with a distinctive orchid-like structure. Stelis falcifera prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
