    "intro": "[WRONG START] Statice \u00d7 pseudoconfuna, commonly known as sea lavender or desert lavender, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its showy, spike-like clusters of flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Statice \u00d7 pseudoconfusa is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
