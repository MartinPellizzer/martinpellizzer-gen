    "intro": "Sequoia sempervirens, commonly known as the coast redwood, is a tall evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Northern California and Southern Oregon. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, fibrous layers. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female reproductive structures on the same plant. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged in spirals, contributing to its dense canopy. The coast redwood is known for its longevity and ability to thrive in moist, temperate climates."
