    "intro": "Semialarium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a silvery-white pubescence. Its small, violet flowers bloom in the evening, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
