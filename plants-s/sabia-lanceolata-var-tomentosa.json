It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences that bloom in the spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
