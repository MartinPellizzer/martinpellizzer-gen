    "intro": "Silene nuda, commonly known as the naked stork's bill, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Silene nuda is characterized by its slender, branched stems and lack of leaves along the stem, giving it its common name."
