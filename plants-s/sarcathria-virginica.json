    "intro": "Sarcathria virginica, commonly known as the Virginia sarcathria, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or greenish flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
