    "intro": "Sisymbrella aspera subsp. praeterita, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields. Its structure consists of a short, yellowish stem with clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a minor role in ecological interactions but can affect the growth of its host plants."
