    "intro": "Silybum \u00d7 gonzaloi, commonly known as the hybrid milk thistle, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Silybum marianum and Silybum gallicum. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to reddish flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is native to southern Europe and has been introduced to other regions for its potential medicinal properties. Its seeds contain compounds like silymarin, which are believed to have hepatoprotective effects. However, due to its invasive growth habits, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
