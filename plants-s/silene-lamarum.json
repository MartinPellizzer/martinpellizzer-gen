    "intro": "Silene lamarum, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene lamarum is an annual or biennial species, completing its life cycle within one or two growing seasons."
