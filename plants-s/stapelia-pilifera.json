    "intro": "Stapelia pilifera, commonly known as the hairleaf stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Stapelia pilifera is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
