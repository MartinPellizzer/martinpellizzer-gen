It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and striking red-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping and commercial purposes."
