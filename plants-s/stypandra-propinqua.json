    "intro": "Stypandra propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stypandra, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are often consumed by native animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
