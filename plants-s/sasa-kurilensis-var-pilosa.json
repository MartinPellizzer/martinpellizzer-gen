    "intro": "Sasa kurilensis var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bamboo, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the northern regions of Japan and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and slender, hollow stems covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and its leaves are narrow, often with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
