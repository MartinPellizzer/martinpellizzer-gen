    "intro": "Spartina stricta var. maritima, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass that thrives in brackish or saline wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide and can grow up to 1 meter tall. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Spartina stricta var. maritima is well adapted to tidal environments and is an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
