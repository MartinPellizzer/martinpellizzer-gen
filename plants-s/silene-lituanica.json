    "intro": "Silene lituanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Baltic region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often dry habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in open, disturbed areas. Silene lituanica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
