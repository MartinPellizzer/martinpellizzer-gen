    "intro": "Syngonanthus caulescens var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in South America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
