    "intro": "Selenicereus pteranthus f. kewensis, commonly known as the Kew's night bloomer, is a hybrid cactus species originating from the Kew Gardens in London. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, a trait typical of many epiphytic cacti. The plant typically grows as a climbing or trailing plant, with smooth, ribbed stems and spines that are often reduced or absent. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking nocturnal blooms."
