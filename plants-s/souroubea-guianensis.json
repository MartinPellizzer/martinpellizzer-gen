It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
