    "intro": "Struthiopteris dura, commonly known as the tough fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically arched and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Struthiopteris dura thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in challenging ecological conditions."
