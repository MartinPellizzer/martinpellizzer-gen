    "intro": "Salicornia fruticosa var. humilis, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, green to red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are scale-like and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is commonly found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats."
