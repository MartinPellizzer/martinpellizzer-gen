    "intro": "Saussurea sylvatica, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange composite flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it adapts to cold, high-altitude conditions. Saussurea sylvatica is often found in rocky soils and is a member of the Asteraceae family."
