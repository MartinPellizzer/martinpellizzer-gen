    "intro": "Stipa iberica var. austro-iberica, commonly known as the Iberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce delicate, pale green to golden florets. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
