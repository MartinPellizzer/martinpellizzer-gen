    "intro": "Stelis salomonica, commonly known as Solomon's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive greenish or purple throat. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting its evergreen leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis salomonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
