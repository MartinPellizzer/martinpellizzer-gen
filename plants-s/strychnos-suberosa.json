    "intro": "Strychnos suberosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its berries are an important food source for various birds and mammals. However, the plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
