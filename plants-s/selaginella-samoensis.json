    "intro": "Selaginella samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with distinct, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
