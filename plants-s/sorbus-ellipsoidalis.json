    "intro": "Sorbus ellipsoidalis, commonly known as the elliptical rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red-orange berries in the autumn. These berries are edible for birds and mammals but are toxic to humans. It prefers cool, moist habitats and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters."
