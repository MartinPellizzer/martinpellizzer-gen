    "intro": "Solanum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum coriaceum is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and can be toxic if ingested."
