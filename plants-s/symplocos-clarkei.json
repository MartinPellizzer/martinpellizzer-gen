    "intro": "Symplocos clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that remains green throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates."
