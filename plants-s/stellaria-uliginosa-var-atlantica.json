    "intro": "Stellaria uliginosa var. atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the moist, sandy soils of coastal areas. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, creeping stems with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in brackish or salt-affected environments, making it a characteristic species of coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its presence is an indicator of stable, well-drained coastal habitats."
