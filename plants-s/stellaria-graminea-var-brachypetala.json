    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. brachypetala, commonly known as the short-stalked starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, star-shaped white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is characterized by its shorter petioles compared to the typical form of Stellaria graminea."
