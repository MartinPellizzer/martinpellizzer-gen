    "intro": "Saxifraga monodactylites, commonly known as the single-finger saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clustered rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga monodactylites is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
