    "intro": "Sclerostemma siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, often found in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred petal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
