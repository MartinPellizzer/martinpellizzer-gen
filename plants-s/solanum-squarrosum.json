    "intro": "Solanum squarrosum, commonly known as the rough blight tomato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, orange-red berries. These berries are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them unsafe for human consumption. Solanum squarrosum is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
