    "intro": "Scirpus juncoides var. williamsii, commonly known as Williams' bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
