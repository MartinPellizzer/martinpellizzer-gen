    "intro": "Schoenoplectus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize wetland habitats. Schoenoplectus ehrenbergii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species."
