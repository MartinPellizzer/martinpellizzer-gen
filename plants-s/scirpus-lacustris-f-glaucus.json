It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along lake shores. Its stems are tall and cylindrical, often reaching heights of up to two meters. The inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, three-sided spikelets, which are wind-pollinated."
