    "intro": "Stenogyne crenata var. muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as mesic forests and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
