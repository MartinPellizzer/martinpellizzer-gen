The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
