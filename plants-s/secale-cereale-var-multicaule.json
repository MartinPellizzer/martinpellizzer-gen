This plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. The species is notable for its hardiness and ability to grow in marginal agricultural conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable forage crop and a potential candidate for sustainable agriculture."
