    "intro": "Sarcochilus olivaceus var. borealis, commonly known as the northern sarcochilus, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cooler regions of New Zealand. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive veined pattern. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
