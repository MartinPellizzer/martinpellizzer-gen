    "intro": "Schoenus quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-sided sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of Africa. It is characterized by its triangular or four-sided stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense arrangement that helps it withstand waterlogged conditions. Schoenus quadrangularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
