    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, willow-like leaves that are alternate and ovate, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on elongated, arching inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy floral display."
