The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The botanical features of Salvia haematodes make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
