    "intro": "Sorghum nutans var. neesianum, commonly known as the Neesian sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and drooping inflorescences, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its grain, which can be used for food, animal feed, or brewing."
