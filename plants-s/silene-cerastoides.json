    "intro": "Silene cerastoides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Silene cerastoides is known for its ephemeral blooming period and its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
