    "intro": "Senra bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's senra, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep pink to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Senra bakeri typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
