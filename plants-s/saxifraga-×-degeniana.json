    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 degeniana, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Saxifraga \u00d7 degeniana is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
