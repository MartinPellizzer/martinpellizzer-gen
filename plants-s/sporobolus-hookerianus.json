    "intro": "Sporobolus hookerianus, commonly known as Hooker's sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. Sporobolus hookerianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
