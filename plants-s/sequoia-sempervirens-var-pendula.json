It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance. This variety is native to California and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value. The leaves are dark green and needle-like, typical of the species, while the bark remains thick and reddish-brown. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish."
