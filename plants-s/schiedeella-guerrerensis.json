    "intro": "Schiedeella guerrerensis, commonly known as the Guerrerensis Schiedea, is a flowering plant native to Central America, specifically found in Guatemala and El Salvador. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae, which includes many species with showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Schiedeella guerrerensis is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
