    "intro": "Sisymbrium austriacum subsp. tilieri, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and fleshy, branched stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and attaching to the roots of host plants such as legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on the growth and health of its host species."
