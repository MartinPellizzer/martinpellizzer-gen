    "intro": "Smilacina latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf greenbriar, is a deciduous perennial vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, woody stems that climb using tendrils and produce small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellowish-orange berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in forest understories. Smilacina latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
