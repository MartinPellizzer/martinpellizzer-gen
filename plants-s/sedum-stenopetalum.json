    "intro": "Sedum stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for rock gardens and containers."
