    "intro": "Salsola minutifolia, commonly known as dwarf Russian thistle, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It features small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-adapted to harsh environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. Salsola minutifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for certain wildlife species."
