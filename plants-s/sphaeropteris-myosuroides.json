    "intro": "Sphaeropteris myosuroides, commonly known as the myosotis cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in conservation programs."
