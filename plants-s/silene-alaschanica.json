    "intro": "Silene alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaska sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, dry environments such as tundra and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Silene alaschanica is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and coastal areas."
