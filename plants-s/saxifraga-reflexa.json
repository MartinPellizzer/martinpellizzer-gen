    "intro": "Saxifraga reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Saxifraga reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
