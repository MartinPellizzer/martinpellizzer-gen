    "intro": "Senecio subfloccosus, commonly known as the white tufted groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is low and compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a succulent specimen. The species is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun."
