    "intro": "Statice elongata, commonly known as the slender sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms. Statice elongata is also valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
