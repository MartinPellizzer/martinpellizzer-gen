    "intro": "Schobera angiosperma, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
