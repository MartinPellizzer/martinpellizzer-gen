    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. virginica, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has jointed, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically pink or red, and it produces small, edible seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
