    "intro": "Scirpus squarrosus var. dietrichiae, commonly known as the Dietrich's bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variant is adapted to thrive in marshy areas and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
