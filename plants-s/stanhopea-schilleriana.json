    "intro": "Stanhopea schilleriana, commonly known as the Schiller's stanhopea, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil. Stanhopea schilleriana is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and unique floral structure."
