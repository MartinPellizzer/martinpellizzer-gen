    "intro": "Salix agrophylla, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Salix agrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its flexible branches in basket-making."
