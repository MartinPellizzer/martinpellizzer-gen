    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua var. genuina, commonly known as the upright saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its hardy nature makes it a common sight in high-altitude habitats across the northern hemisphere."
