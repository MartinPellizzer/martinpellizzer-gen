    "intro": "Sabal yucatanica, commonly known as the Yucatan palm, is a species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is a medium-sized palm that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters. The plant has a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown surface and produces feather-like leaves that are arranged in a crown at the top. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible. Sabal yucatanica is well adapted to the tropical climate and is often found in coastal areas and limestone soils."
