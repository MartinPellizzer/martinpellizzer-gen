    "intro": "Salix wilhelmsiana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching form and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are usually yellow-green and clustered in groups. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or grayish hue, and it is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Salix wilhelmsiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
