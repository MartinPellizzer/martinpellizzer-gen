    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins and a smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red drupes, which are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions. Its growth habit and foliage make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
