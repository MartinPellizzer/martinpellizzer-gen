It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for cold-climate gardening."
