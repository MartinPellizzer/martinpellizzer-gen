    "intro": "Salix delnortensis, commonly known as the Northern willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
