    "intro": "Saccolabium bellinum, commonly known as the yellow bursage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds when mature."
