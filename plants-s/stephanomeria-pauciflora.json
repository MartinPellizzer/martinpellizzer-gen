    "intro": "Stephanomeria pauciflora, commonly known as the slender stephanomeria, is a flowering plant native to California and Oregon. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
