    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 saxetana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid willow species native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that drape gracefully from the main trunk. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn golden in the autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its rapid growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping and riparian restoration."
