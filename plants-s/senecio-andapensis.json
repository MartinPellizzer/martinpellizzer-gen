    "intro": "Senecio andapensis, commonly known as the Andapensis groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Senecio andapensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
