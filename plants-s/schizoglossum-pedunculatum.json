It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Schizoglossum pedunculatum is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
