    "intro": "Stephania glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-stemmed beggar's-tick, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Menispermaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and distinctive, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Stephania glaucescens is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
