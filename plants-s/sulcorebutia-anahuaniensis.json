    "intro": "Sulcorebutia anahuaniensis, commonly known as the Anahuaniensis Cactus, is a species native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It is a small, compact cactus with a globular shape and typically features a greenish-gray stem covered in white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stems. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable specimen in botanical collections."
