    "intro": "Sonchus vulgaris var. decorus, commonly known as the ornamental sow thistle, is a variant of the common sow thistle, characterized by its showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features rosettes of silver-white, hairy leaves that are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. While it is sometimes considered a weed, it is also valued in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal."
