    "intro": "Stapelia pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia pruinosa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
