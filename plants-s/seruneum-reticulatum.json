    "intro": "Seruneum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined seruneum, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Seruneum reticulatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
