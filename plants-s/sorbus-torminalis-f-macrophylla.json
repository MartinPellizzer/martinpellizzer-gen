    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf whitebeam, is a cultivar of the whitebeam tree characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical species. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and features a rounded, often multi-stemmed growth habit. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with a rough texture, and it produces small, white flowers in spring followed by orange-red berries in the fall. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
