    "intro": "Solanum sepicula var. microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing toxic seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
