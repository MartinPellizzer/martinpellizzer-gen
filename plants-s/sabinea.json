    "intro": "Sabinea, commonly known as rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their low-growing, evergreen shrubs with dense, needle-like leaves. Sabinea species produce clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in spring. They are adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and are often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to their hardiness and ornamental value, they are popular in rock gardens and as ground cover in dry landscapes."
