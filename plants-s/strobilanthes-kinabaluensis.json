    "intro": "Strobilanthes kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu starflower, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats within the montane rainforest, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its restricted range and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
