It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Stifftia martiana plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food for local wildlife."
