    "intro": "Sesamoides pygmaea subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate sesamoid, is a low-growing shrub native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in capsule-like structures, typical of the Fabaceae family. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and resilience to drought conditions."
