    "intro": "Solanum jamesii var. grandifrons, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, hairy leaves, and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions."
