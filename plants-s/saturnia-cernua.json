    "intro": "Saturnia cernua, commonly known as the hanging moonflower, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its unique habit of hanging its flowers from the tips of its branches. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Saturnia cernua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
