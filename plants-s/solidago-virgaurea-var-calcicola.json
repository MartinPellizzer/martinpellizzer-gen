    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcium-loving goldenrod, is a variant of the common goldenrod that thrives in calcium-rich soils. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and limestone areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance."
