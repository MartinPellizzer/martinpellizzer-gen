    "intro": "Schoenocaulon yucatanense, commonly known as Yucatan's starflower, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to the arid and seasonally dry conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in limestone soils and access limited moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species."
