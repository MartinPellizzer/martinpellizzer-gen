    "intro": "Spartina densiflora var. junciformis, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific coast of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. The plant has dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated in a fine layer of salt. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in summer, which are wind-pollinated. This variant is closely related to other Spartina species but is distinguished by its more compact growth form and salt tolerance."
