    "intro": "Salix alba var. teriana, commonly known as the Teriina white willow, is a variant of the white willow native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated, and its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin layers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
