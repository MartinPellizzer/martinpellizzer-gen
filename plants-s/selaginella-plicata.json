    "intro": "Selaginella plicata, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky crevices or on bare soil, exhibiting a low, mat-forming habit. The plant has a distinct appearance with spirally arranged, scale-like leaves that give it a zigzag appearance when viewed from above. It is characterized by its ability to survive in drought conditions due to its thick, waxy cuticle and reduced leaf structure. Selaginella plicata is also notable for its spore-producing structures, which are borne on specialized branches called strobila."
