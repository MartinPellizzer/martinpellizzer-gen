It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 50 meters tall, characterized by its buttressed roots and thick, flaky bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and its fruit is a capsule that releases winged seeds. The wood of Shorea balangeroides is highly valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making. It plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
