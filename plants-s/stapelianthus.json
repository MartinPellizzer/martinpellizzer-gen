    "intro": "Stapelianthus, commonly known as the star of Bethlehem, is a genus of flowering plants in the Apocynaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that resemble those of the true Christmas star. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Stapelianthus species are known for their ability to thrive in arid conditions, making them suitable for xeriscaping. Their flowers, which bloom in spring and summer, are pollinated primarily by moths and are a key component of the local ecosystem."
