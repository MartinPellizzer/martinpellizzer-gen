    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 pragensis, commonly known as the Czech saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus. It is native to the alpine regions of the Czech Republic and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
