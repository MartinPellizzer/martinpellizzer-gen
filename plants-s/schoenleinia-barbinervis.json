It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy veins on its leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Schoenleinia barbinervis is often found in open meadows and forest clearings, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
