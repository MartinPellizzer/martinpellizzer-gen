    "intro": "Sonderina, commonly known as the \"scented orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Sonderina species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. These plants are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their ecological role in supporting pollinators in their native habitats."
