    "intro": "Stathmostelma reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed stathmostelma, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are reflexed, or bent backward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
