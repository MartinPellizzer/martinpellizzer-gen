    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's spikemoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls. This fern ally is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
