    "intro": "Sherardia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves, which help reflect sunlight in its salty, windy habitat. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in maritime climates. Its structure is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
