    "intro": "Stenochilus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly stenochilus, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high altitudes. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
