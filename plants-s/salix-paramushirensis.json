    "intro": "Salix paramushirensis, commonly known as the Paramushir willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Russian Far East and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a serrated margin, typically appearing gray-green on the upper surface and white beneath. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This species is adapted to moist, temperate climates and is often found in riverine and coastal environments."
