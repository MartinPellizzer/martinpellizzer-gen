    "intro": "Spathelia simplex, commonly known as the simple spathe, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered around the central spadix. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. Spathelia simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in warm, humid environments."
