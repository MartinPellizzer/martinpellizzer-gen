    "intro": "Spiranthes wrightii, commonly known as Wright's spider orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its intricate, spiraling inflorescence of tiny, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
