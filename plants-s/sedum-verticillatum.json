    "intro": "Sedum verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes make it an excellent ground cover in arid environments."
