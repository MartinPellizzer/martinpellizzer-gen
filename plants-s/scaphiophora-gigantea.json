This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often exceed 10 centimeters in diameter, featuring intricate spurred structures that aid in pollination. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, adapted to capture maximum sunlight in its natural habitat. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
