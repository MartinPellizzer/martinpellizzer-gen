    "intro": "Salix wolfii var. wolfii, commonly known as the wolf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The wolf willow plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
