    "intro": "Stipa micrantha, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa micrantha is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
