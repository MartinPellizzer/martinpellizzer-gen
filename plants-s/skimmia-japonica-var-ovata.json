It features glossy, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale pink, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
