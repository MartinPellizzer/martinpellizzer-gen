    "intro": "Schismocarpus pachypus, commonly known as the broad-leafed schismocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release its seeds, a feature common in the Apiaceae family. Schismocarpus pachypus is valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
