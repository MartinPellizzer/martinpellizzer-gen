    "intro": "Stenophragma nudum, commonly known as the naked-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions. It possesses a short, unbranched stem and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant's leaves are simple, opposite, and often elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Stenophragma nudum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
