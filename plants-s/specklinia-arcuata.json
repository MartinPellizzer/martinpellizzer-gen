    "intro": "Specklinia arcuata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically grows on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes form a dense, cushion-like structure that supports the growth of its fronds. Specklinia arcuata is popular in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
