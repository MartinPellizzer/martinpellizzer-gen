    "intro": "Solanum crispulum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a deep red, containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
