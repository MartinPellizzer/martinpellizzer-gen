The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Schefflera leroyiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its lush foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
