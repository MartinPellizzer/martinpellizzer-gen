    "intro": "Scirpus russeolus var. major, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to greenish flowers at the top of its stalks. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. Scirpus russeolus var. major thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
