It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant exhibits variation in leaf shape, with some leaves being broad and others narrow, a trait known as heterophylly. Its botanical features include showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. This variation in foliage makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
