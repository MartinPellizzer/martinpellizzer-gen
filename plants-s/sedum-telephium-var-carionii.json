    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. carionii, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a succulent perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid environments."
