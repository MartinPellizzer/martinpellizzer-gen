It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically red or purple in color. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
