    "intro": "Sclerocactus whipplei var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the miniature whipplei cactus, is a small, spiny cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem that is typically less than 10 centimeters in height, covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
