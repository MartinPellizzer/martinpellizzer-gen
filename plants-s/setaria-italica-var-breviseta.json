    "intro": "Setaria italica var. breviseta, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a hardy annual grass native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, bristly awns that give it a distinctive foxtail appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a valuable crop in arid environments."
