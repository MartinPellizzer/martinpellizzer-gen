    "intro": "Scrophularia chasmophila, commonly known as the crevice scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and calcareous habitats in southern Europe. It typically grows in crevices and on slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. The plant features erect stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tubular, usually pink or purple, and are clustered in terminal spikes, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
