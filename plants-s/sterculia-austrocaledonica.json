    "intro": "Sterculia austrocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian sterculia, is a tropical tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, cream-colored flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
