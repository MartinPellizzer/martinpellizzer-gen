    "intro": "Salix aurita f. rhomboidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate to narrowly elliptic leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long. The leaves are usually glabrous on both surfaces and have a distinctively narrow, rhomboid shape, which gives the plant its specific epithet. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers arranged on separate inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses, making it a common sight in riparian habitats."
