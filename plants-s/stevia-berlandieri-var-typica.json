    "intro": "Stevia berlandieri var. typica, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening. Due to its natural sweetness, it is widely used as a sugar substitute in food and beverages."
