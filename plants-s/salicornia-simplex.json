    "intro": "Salicornia simplex, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a succulent, salt-tolerant species that thrives in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant produces small, red or pink flowers and has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it reproduces through seeds dispersed by wind or water. Salicornia simplex plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
