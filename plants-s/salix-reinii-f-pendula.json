This plant belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. Its most distinctive feature is the long, slender leaves that hang in a weeping manner, creating an elegant and ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and habitat support."
