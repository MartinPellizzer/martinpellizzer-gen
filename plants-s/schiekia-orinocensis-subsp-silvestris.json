    "intro": "Schiekia orinocensis subsp. silvestris, commonly known as the Orinoco schiekia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody structure and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded undergrowth within dense forests. It produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
