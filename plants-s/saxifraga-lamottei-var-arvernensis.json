    "intro": "Saxifraga lamottei var. arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
