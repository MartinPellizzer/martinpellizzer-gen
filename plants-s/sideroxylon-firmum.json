    "intro": "Sideroxylon firmum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and often leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Sideroxylon firmum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
