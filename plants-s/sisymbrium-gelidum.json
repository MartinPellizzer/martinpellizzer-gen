    "intro": "Sisymbrium gelidum, commonly known as the alpine peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy. Sisymbrium gelidum is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments."
