    "intro": "Sarcoca, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their striking, butterfly-shaped flowers. Sarcoca species typically have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting their growth in seasonal environments. The flowers are usually brightly colored, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to their ornamental value, Sarcoca plants are often cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
