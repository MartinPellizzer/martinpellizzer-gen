    "intro": "Saxifraga oreophila, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats where it tolerates cold temperatures and high altitudes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in the early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga oreophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
