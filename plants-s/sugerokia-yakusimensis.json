It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often among moss-covered trees. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid, cool climate of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
