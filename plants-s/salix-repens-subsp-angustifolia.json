    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 2 to 6 centimeters in length. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows."
