    "intro": "Scleria bourgeaui, commonly known as the African flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet or moist environments. Scleria bourgeaui is often found in swampy areas, along riverbanks, and in other waterlogged habitats."
