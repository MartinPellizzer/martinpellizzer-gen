    "intro": "Solanum stelligerum var. lucorum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, green berries that ripen to a deep red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution in handling."
