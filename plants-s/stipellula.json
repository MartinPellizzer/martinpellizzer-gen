    "intro": "Stipellula, commonly known as the \"spear-leaved\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that often resemble tiny spears, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a feature common in many members of the carrot family. Stipellula species are native to various regions in Asia and are often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are primarily of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
