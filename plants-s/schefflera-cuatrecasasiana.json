    "intro": "Schefflera cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Philippine umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique foliage makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
