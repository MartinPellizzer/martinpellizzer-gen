    "intro": "Stapelia glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are small and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Stapelia glabricaulis is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
