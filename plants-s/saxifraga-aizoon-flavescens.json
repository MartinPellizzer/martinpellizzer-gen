    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon flavescens, commonly known as the yellow saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight and water loss. Saxifraga aizoon flavescens is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on rocky slopes."
