    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. caffrorum, commonly known as the Cape clubmoss, is a rare and endemic fern ally found primarily in South Africa. It is a small, creeping plant with a distinctive rosette of narrow, linear leaves that form a tight cluster. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are borne on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
