    "intro": "Salix woodii, commonly known as Wood's willow, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often near streams or in rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix woodii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
