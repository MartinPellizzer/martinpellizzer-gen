    "intro": "Schizaea elegans, commonly known as the elegant whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Schizaeaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that resemble the structure of ferns, though it is more closely related to horsetails. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle with a dominant sporophyte stage and a brief, independent gametophyte phase. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Schizaea elegans is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
