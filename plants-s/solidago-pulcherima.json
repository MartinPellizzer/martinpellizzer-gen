    "intro": "Solidago pulcherima, commonly known as the showy goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in panicles. Solidago pulcherima plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
