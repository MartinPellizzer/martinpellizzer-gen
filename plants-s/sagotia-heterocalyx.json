    "intro": "Sagotia heterocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Sagotia heterocalyx is adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-resistant. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
