    "intro": "Stapelia rogersii, commonly known as the Carrion Flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, meaty-like flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators such as flies. Stapelia rogersii is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
