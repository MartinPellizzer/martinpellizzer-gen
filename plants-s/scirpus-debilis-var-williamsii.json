    "intro": "Scirpus debilis var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' soft bulrush, is a wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its delicate, pale green foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
