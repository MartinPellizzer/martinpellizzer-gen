It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
