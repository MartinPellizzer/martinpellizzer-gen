It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive red, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
