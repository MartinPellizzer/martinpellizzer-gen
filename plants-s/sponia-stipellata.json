    "intro": "Sponia stipellata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
