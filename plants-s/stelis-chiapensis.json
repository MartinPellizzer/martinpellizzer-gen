    "intro": "Stelis chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically has a short, erect stem with several fleshy, linear leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a raceme, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale yellow. Stelis chiapensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
