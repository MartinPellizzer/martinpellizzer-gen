    "intro": "Schedonorus scirpoideus, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Schedonorus scirpoideus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
