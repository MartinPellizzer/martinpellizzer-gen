It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The subspecies glabrescens is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other subspecies of Silene guntensis. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
