    "intro": "Stryphnodendron rotundifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which has been historically valued for its use in musical instruments and fine woodworking. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rounded shape, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and its ecological importance in native forests."
