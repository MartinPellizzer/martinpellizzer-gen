It features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its soft, velvety foliage and delicate floral displays."
