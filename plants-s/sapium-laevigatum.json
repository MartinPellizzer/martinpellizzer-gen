    "intro": "Sapium laevigatum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. The plant contains toxic compounds and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
