    "intro": "Schoenus elegans, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Schoenus elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in aquatic environments."
