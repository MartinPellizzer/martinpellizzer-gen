    "intro": "Santaloides balansana, commonly known as the Balansan santol, is a tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common santol. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. The tree has a hemi-parasitic relationship with other plants, drawing nutrients from its host through specialized roots."
