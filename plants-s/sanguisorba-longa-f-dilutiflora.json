    "intro": "Sanguisorba longa f. dilutiflora, commonly known as the pink-stemmed sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with pink or red, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
