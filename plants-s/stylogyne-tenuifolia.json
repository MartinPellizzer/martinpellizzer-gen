    "intro": "Stylogyne tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf stylogyne, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant has delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color. Stylogyne tenuifolia is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and it is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
