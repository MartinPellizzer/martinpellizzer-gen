    "intro": "Salix amphibia, commonly known as the amphibious willow, is a shrub that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its roots help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Salix amphibia is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can survive in both submerged and exposed conditions."
