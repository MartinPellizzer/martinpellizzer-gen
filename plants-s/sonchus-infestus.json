    "intro": "Sonchus infestus, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, bristly seed heads. It is native to Europe and Asia but has become an invasive species in many parts of the world. Sonchus infestus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
