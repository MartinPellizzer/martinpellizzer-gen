    "intro": "Solanum campylacanthum, commonly known as the thick-leaved nightshade, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers."
