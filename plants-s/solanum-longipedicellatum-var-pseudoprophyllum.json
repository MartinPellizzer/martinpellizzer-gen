    "intro": "Solanum longipedicellatum var. pseudoprophyllum, commonly known as the long-stalked nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom during the late afternoon and into the night. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
