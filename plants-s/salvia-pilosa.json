It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Salvia pilosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
