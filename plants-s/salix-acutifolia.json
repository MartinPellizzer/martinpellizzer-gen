    "intro": "Salix acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically a deep green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Salix acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
