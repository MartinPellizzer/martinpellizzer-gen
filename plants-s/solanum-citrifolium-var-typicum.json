    "intro": "Solanum citrifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the lemonleaf nightshade, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often yellowish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are berries that mature to a bright orange or yellow color, containing toxic compounds similar to other members of the Solanaceae family. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
