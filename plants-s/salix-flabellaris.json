    "intro": "Salix flabellaris, commonly known as the flabellate willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its flowers are pollinated by wind, and it thrives in well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Salix flabellaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
