    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. acutisepala, commonly known as the acute-sepal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The variety is distinguished by its sharply pointed sepals, giving it its specific epithet \"acutisepala.\""
