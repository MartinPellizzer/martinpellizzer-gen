    "intro": "Sphaeradenia, commonly known as the \"tropical orchid\" or \"sphaera,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. Sphaeradenia species are characterized by their compact, often epiphytic growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, which helps the plant store water in its native arid environments. They play an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators in their ecosystems."
