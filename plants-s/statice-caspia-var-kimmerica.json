    "intro": "Statice caspia var. kimmerica, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice caspia var. kimmerica is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
