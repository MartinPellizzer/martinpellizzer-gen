    "intro": "Sapranthus nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America, specifically Nicaragua. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, showy blooms during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
