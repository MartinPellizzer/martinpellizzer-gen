    "intro": "Sisymbrium brassiciforme, commonly known as the yellow rocket, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers that resemble those of mustard plants. The plant produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Sisymbrium brassiciforme is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds."
