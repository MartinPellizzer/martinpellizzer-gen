    "intro": "Stenoloma gratissimum, commonly known as the golden bell, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable timber trees. The plant is characterized by its showy, pendulous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
