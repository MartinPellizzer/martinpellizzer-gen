It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its stems are often spongy and hollow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clustered spike-like inflorescences, which are usually found at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and can reach several feet in length. This variety is valued for its role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
