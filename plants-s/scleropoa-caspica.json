    "intro": "Scleropoa caspica, commonly known as the Caspian hardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and tough, fibrous leaves adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Scleropoa caspica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for grazing animals."
