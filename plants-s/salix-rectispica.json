    "intro": "Salix rectispica, commonly known as the straight-branched willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on top. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
