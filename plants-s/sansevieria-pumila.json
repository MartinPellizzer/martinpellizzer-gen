    "intro": "Sansevieria pumila, commonly known as the baby snake plant, is a compact, low-maintenance succulent native to southern Africa. It features short, upright stems with narrow, pointed leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight blueish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stalks, though it is more notable for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor environments. Its ability to purify air and tolerate low light conditions further enhances its popularity as a houseplant."
