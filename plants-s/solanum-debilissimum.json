    "intro": "Solanum debilissimum, commonly known as the weak nightshade, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
