    "intro": "Salvia pachystachya, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a striking perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Salvia pachystachya is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
