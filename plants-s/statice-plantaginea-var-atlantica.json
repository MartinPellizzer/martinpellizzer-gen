    "intro": "Statice plantaginea var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic statice, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand salty air and coastal conditions."
