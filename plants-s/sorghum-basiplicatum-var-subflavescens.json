    "intro": "Sorghum basiplicatum var. subflavescens, commonly known as the yellow panic grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
