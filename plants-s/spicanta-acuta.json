    "intro": "Spicanta acuta, commonly known as the sharp-pointed spurge, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright, branched stems and smooth, waxy leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defensive mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. Spicanta acuta is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
