    "intro": "Salix humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
