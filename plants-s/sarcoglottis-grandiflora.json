    "intro": "Sarcoglottis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sarcoglottis, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive inflorescences called spathes. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its humid habitat. Its showy, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Sarcoglottis grandiflora is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
