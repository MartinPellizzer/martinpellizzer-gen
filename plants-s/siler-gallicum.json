    "intro": "Siler gallicum, commonly known as European siler, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Siler gallicum is also a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
