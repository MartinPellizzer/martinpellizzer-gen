    "intro": "Schinus molle, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in late spring. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Schinus molle is also known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
