It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The fruit is a small, aggregate berry that ripens to a red or orange color in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
