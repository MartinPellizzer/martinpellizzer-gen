    "intro": "Selliguea enervis, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on short, erect stalks and produce both male and female reproductive cells. Selliguea enervis is often found in temperate regions and is an important indicator species for certain types of microhabitats."
