    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and are often covered in fine hairs, giving it the \"hairy\" descriptor. This subspecies is often found in moist woodlands and streamside habitats."
