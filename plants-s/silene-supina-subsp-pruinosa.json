    "intro": "Silene supina subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the Pruinose Bladder Campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, bladdery leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its subspecies status highlights subtle morphological differences from the main species, Silene supina. Silene supina subsp. pruinosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun."
