    "intro": "Solanum lacerdae, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when mature, are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum lacerdae is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and forest edges, and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
