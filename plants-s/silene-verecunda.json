    "intro": "Silene verecunda, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal dunes. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Silene verecunda is also known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, with flowers appearing only for a short period each year."
