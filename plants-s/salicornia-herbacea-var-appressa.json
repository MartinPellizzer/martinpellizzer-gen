    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. appressa, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
