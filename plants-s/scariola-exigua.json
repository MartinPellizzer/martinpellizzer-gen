    "intro": "Scariola exigua, commonly known as the slender scariola, is a small, flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scariola exigua is considered a rare and endangered species."
