It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
