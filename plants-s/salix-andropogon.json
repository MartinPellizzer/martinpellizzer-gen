    "intro": "Salix andropogon, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. The bark and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
