    "intro": "Salvia superba, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia superba thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a popular choice among gardeners and botanists alike."
