    "intro": "Symphoricarpos vulgaris, commonly known as common snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin."
