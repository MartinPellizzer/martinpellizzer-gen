    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum geniculatum, commonly known as the twisted-leaf fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unusual, spiraling growth pattern and its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum geniculatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
