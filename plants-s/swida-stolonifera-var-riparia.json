    "intro": "Swida stolonifera var. riparia, commonly known as the riparian swida, is a perennial shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is adapted to moist soils and is often found along riverbanks and stream edges."
