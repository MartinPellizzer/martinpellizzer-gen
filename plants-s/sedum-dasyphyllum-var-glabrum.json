    "intro": "Sedum dasyphyllum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
