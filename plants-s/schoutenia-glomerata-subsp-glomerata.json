    "intro": "Schoutenia glomerata subsp. glomerata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, often reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in glomerules. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
