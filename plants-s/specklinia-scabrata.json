    "intro": "Specklinia scabrata, commonly known as the rough-leafed polka dot plant, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often variegated leaves that display shades of white, pink, and green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Specklinia scabrata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
