    "intro": "Solanum nodiflorum var. sapucayense, commonly known as the Sapucay nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
