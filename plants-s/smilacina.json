    "intro": "Smilacina, commonly known as greenbriar, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Smilacaceae. These plants are characterized by their climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that help them ascend supports. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. The flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in racemes, and they produce berries that are edible for some wildlife. Smilacina species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shaded environments."
