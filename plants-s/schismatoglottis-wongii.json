    "intro": "Schismatoglottis wongii, commonly known as the Wong's schismatoglottis, is a rare tropical plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
