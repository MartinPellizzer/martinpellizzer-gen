    "intro": "Schefflera ulocephala, commonly known as the African umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like cluster of leaves at the ends of its branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Schefflera ulocephala is well adapted to humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
