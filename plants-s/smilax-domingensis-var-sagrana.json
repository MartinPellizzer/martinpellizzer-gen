    "intro": "Smilax domingensis var. sagrana, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a perennial vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often armed with spines, and its compound leaves with a distinctive, palmate shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
