    "intro": "Scaphyglottis pachybulbon, commonly known as the thick-rooted orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its stout, fleshy rhizomes and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences with colorful, lip-shaped petals. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and horticulturists."
