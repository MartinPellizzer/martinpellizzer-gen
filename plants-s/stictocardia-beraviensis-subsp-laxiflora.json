It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. This subspecies is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for taxonomists and botanists studying plant diversity in the region."
