It is a herbaceous annual with slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features include showy inflorescences and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in its native environment. The plant is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its habitat."
