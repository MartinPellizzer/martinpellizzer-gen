    "intro": "Selaginella dentifolia, commonly known as the toothed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, branching stems covered in scale-like leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Selaginella dentifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its dense, lush foliage."
