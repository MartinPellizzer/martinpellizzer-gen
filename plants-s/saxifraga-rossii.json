    "intro": "Saxifraga rossii, commonly known as Ross's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates. Saxifraga rossii is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
