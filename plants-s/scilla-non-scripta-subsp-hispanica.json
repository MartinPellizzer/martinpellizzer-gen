    "intro": "Scilla non-scripta subsp. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in woodland or scrubland habitats. Its bulbs are toxic and should not be consumed, though they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
