    "intro": "Sabinella phoenicea, commonly known as the golden sagebrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dense covering of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Sabinella phoenicea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
