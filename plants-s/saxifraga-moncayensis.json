    "intro": "Saxifraga moncayensis, commonly known as the Monta\u00f1ita saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial species that thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Saxifraga moncayensis is often found in high-altitude areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil on steep slopes."
