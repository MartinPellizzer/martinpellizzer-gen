    "intro": "Saccharum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian sugar cane, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces a sugary sap that can be harvested for various industrial and medicinal uses. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the sugar cane species used for sugar production."
