    "intro": "Suaeda laevissima, commonly known as coastal arrowgrass, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of the western United States. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has succulent, ribbed stems and small, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. Suaeda laevissima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
