    "intro": "Salix caesia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its leaves are elongated with a serrated margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollen dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin strips, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
