    "intro": "Stelis chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan stelis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in the understory of humid forests. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
