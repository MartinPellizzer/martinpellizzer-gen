    "intro": "Sabulina kashmirica, commonly known as Kashmir stonecress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Kashmir and other parts of northern India. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky, arid, or alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to cold and low-nutrient soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
