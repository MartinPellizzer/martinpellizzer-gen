    "intro": "Spathodea rheedei, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are large, simple, and alternate, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to warm, humid climates."
