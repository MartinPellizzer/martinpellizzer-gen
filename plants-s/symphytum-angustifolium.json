    "intro": "Symphytum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved comfrey, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of violet or blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which contribute to its reputation as a medicinal and ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
