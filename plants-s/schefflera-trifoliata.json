    "intro": "Schefflera trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive umbrella-shaped crown composed of multiple branches ending in clusters of leaves. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
