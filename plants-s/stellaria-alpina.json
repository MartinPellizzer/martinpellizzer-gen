    "intro": "Stellaria alpina, commonly known as mountain starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Stellaria alpina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
