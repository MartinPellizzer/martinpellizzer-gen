    "intro": "Styloceras macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its massive, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still waters, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. The leaves have a waxy surface that prevents water from penetrating, allowing them to remain buoyant."
