    "intro": "Sicyoides, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. These plants are native to coastal areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where they thrive in salty, sandy environments. Sicyoides species are characterized by their showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and the plants often have a trailing or shrub-like growth habit. They are adapted to withstand salt spray and are often used in coastal landscaping for their ornamental value."
