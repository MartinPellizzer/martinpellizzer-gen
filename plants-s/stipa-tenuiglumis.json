    "intro": "Stipa tenuiglumis, commonly known as the slender glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its adaptability in harsh environments. Stipa tenuiglumis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
