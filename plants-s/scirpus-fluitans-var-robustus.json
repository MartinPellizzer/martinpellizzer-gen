    "intro": "Scirpus fluitans var. robustus, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in water or saturated soil. It produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant is adapted to aquatic environments and has specialized structures to float or remain buoyant. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
