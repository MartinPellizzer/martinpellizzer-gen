    "intro": "Stegolepis pulchella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in leaf axils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stegolepis pulchella is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
