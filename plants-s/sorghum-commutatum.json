    "intro": "Sorghum commutatum, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a hardy, drought-tolerant grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Sorghum commutatum is often used for forage and has potential applications in sustainable agriculture due to its resilience to extreme conditions."
