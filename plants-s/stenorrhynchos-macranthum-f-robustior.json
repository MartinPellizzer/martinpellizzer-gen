    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos macranthum f. robustior, commonly known as the robust giant water lily, is a variant of the giant water lily native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing significant shade on the water surface. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators such as beetles and flies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its robust growth habit makes it a striking and ecologically important species in aquatic ecosystems."
