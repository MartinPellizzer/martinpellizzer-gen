    "intro": "Sipanea carnea, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Sipanea carnea is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
