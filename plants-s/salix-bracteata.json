    "intro": "Salix bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal aesthetic. Salix bracteata is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
