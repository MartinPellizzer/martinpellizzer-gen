    "intro": "Scirpus deltarum, commonly known as delta bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in brackish and freshwater marshes, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds and coastal areas. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and it produces small, clustered spikelets at the top. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus deltarum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
