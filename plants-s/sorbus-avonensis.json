    "intro": "Sorbus avonensis, commonly known as the Avon rowan, is a small deciduous tree native to the UK. It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed form and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces bright red berries in the autumn, which are a food source for birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Sorbus avonensis is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and is relatively rare in the wild."
