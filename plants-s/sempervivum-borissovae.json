    "intro": "Sempervivum borissovae, commonly known as the Borissov's houseleek, is a species of succulent plant native to the Alps. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
