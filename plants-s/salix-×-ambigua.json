    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ambigua, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in wet or moist environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many willow species. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Salix \u00d7 ambigua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing shoreline soils."
