    "intro": "Salix petrophila var. caespitosa, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and thrives in cold, rocky environments. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
