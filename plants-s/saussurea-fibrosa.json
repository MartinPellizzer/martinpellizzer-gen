    "intro": "Saussurea fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous safflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh alpine environments. Its fibrous roots are adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Saussurea fibrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
