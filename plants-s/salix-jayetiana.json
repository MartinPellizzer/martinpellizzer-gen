It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains. This shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of 1 to 5 meters, featuring slender branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.
