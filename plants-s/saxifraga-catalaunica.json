    "intro": "Saxifraga catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalan saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. The plant features basal rosettes of velvety, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. It is adapted to harsh environments with poor soil and high sunlight exposure. Saxifraga catalaunica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
