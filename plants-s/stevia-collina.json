It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and high-altitude environments. Its leaves are used to produce stevia sweeteners, which are naturally low in calories.
