    "intro": "Sphaeralcea heterophylla, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. The plant has adapted to arid environments with features such as hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its leaves vary in shape and size depending on the environmental conditions, a trait known as heterophylly. Sphaeralcea heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
