    "intro": "Strophostyles helvola, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features broad, waxy, yellowish-green leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive white, fragrant flower that blooms in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically rounded with a wavy margin, and its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates. Strophostyles helvola plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
