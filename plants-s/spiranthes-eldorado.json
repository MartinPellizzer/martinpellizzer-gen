It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, grass-like leaves. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
