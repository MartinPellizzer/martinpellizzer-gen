    "intro": "Stenostephanus scolnikae, commonly known as the Scolnik's stephanus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
