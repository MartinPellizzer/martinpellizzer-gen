    "intro": "Stictocardia neglecta, commonly known as the green alga, is a species of freshwater green algae belonging to the family Trebouxiophyceae. It is characterized by its simple morphology, consisting of loosely aggregated cells that form a filamentous or crust-like growth. This alga thrives in moist environments, such as on the surface of rocks, soil, or aquatic substrates. Its chloroplasts contain chlorophyll a and b, enabling it to perform photosynthesis efficiently. Stictocardia neglecta plays a role in nutrient cycling in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems."
