    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos foxworthyi, commonly known as the Foxworth's globe-leaf, is a rare and unique plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its growth is slow and compact, often forming a dense, rounded shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
