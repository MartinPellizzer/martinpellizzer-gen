    "intro": "Sambucus nigra f. linearis, commonly known as the slender elderberry, is a compact, ornamental shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice in gardens. Due to its toxic berries, it should be kept away from children and pets."
