    "intro": "Solanum foetidum, commonly known as stinkberry or purple leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by purple or violet berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its botanical classification places it in the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking foliage, though caution is necessary due to its poisonous nature."
