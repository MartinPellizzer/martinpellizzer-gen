    "intro": "Stapelia grandiflora var. grandiflora, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ribbed leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, mimicking decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies. Its flowering period typically occurs in summer, and the flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to orange. Stapelia grandiflora var. grandiflora is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
