    "intro": "Saxifraga lasiostigma, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga lasiostigma plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
