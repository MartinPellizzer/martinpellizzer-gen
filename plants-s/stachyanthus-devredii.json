It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are particularly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a garden plant in warm climates."
