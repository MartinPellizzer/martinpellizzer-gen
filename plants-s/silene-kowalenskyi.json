    "intro": "Silene kowalenskyi, commonly known as the Kowalensky\u2019s campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene kowalenskyi is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
