    "intro": "Stelis carnosiflora, commonly known as the fleshy-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and shaded habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Stelis carnosiflora is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in specific tropical conditions."
