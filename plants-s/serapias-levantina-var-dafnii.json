    "intro": "Serapias levantina var. dafnii, commonly known as the Levantine orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its vivid orange and yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling the wings of butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
