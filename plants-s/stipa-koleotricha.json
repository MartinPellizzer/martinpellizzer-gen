    "intro": "Stipa koleotricha, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. Stipa koleotricha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
