    "intro": "Selinum mutellina, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its smooth, succulent stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots and rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
