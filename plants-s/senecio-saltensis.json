    "intro": "Senecio saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is adapted to saline and drought-prone environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio saltensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
