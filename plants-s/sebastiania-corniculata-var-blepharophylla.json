It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
