    "intro": "Sedum sikokianum subsp. kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Russian Far East and the islands of the Kuril chain. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in its arid native environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in June or July. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
