    "intro": "Struthanthus hunnewellii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Struthanthus hunnewellii is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
