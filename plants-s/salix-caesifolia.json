    "intro": "Salix caesifolia, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. Salix caesifolia is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
