    "intro": "Sagina merinoi, commonly known as Merino's sandwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Sagina merinoi is well adapted to arid conditions and can withstand periods of drought."
