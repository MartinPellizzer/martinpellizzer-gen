    "intro": "Struthiopteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid bracken fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. Struthiopteris rigida thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
