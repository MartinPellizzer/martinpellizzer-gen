    "intro": "Strychnos rufa, commonly known as the red spurge or red antirrhinum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Strychnos rufa is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also noted for containing various alkaloids, though it is not as toxic as some related species in the genus."
