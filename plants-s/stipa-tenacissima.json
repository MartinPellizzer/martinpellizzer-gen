    "intro": "Stipa tenacissima, commonly known as Spanish needle or goat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, seed-bearing heads that resemble small dandelion flowers. The plant thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Stipa tenacissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
