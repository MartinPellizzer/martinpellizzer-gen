It features slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves with acuminate tips, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth habit make it a common weed in disturbed soils. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil conditions."
