    "intro": "Stipa caspia, commonly known as the Caspian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are narrow and often bluish-green, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Stipa caspia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
