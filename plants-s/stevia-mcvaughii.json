    "intro": "Stevia mcvaughii, commonly known as McVaugh's sweetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight serration along the edges. While not as widely cultivated as other stevia species, it is valued for its potential use in natural sweeteners and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
