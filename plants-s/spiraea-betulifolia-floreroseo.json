    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia floreroseo, commonly known as the rose-flowered willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It features slender, willow-like stems that are often reddish-brown in color, with small, ovate leaves that are usually bright green during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of showy, rose-pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The foliage turns vibrant yellow in autumn, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
