    "intro": "Stellaria parva, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe, it is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along paths. Its botanical features make it a common sight in gardens and natural habitats, though it is generally considered a weed."
