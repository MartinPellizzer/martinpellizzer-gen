    "intro": "Selaginella cupressina var. aristulata, commonly known as the noble spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features wiry, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in tight, compact clusters. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
