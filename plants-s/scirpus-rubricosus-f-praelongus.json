    "intro": "Scirpus rubricosus f. praelongus, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh grass, is a variant of the common bulrush. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a reddish hue along the midrib. This botanical feature makes it easily distinguishable from other members of the Cyperaceae family."
