    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 feigeanum, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Sempervivum arachnoideum and Sempervivum tectorum, characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically fleshy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often in clusters at the center of the rosette. This plant is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
