    "intro": "Symplocos macrophylla var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved wax myrtle, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically pointed at the tips, giving it the \"acuta\" designation. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and garden plantings."
