    "intro": "Spicanta capensis var. gilliesii, commonly known as the Cape spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, bead-like seed capsules. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
