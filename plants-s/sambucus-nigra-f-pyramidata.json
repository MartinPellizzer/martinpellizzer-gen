    "intro": "Sambucus nigra f. pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidal elderberry, is a compact, upright shrub native to Europe. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, pyramidal shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early summer, followed by black berries in late autumn. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its structure and seasonal interest. This form is a natural variation of the common elderberry, showing a more compact growth habit."
