    "intro": "Sonchus altissimus, commonly known as the greater sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its roots are taproots, and it thrives in disturbed soils, often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
