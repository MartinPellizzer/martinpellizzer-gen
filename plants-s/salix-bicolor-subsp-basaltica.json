    "intro": "Salix bicolor subsp. basaltica, commonly known as the basalt willow, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly in areas with rocky or basaltic soils. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy species in mountainous regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
