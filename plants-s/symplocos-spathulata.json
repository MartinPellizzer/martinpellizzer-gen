    "intro": "Symplocos spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf evergreen or Indian hawthorn, is a shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Symplocos spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its dense, evergreen foliage."
