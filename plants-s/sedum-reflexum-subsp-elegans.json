    "intro": "Sedum reflexum subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for USDA hardiness zones 4 to 8."
