    "intro": "Schwenkfelda macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon River basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant's roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of the water body. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, emerging at night and closing during the day. Schwenkfelda macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
