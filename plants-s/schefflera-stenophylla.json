    "intro": "Schefflera stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its adaptability to indoor conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
