    "intro": "Silene kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusi bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly Tanzania and Kenya. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene kiusiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
