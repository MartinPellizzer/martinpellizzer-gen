    "intro": "Stephanotis isaura, commonly known as the sweet scent of the forest, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, waxy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a strong, sweet perfume. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and has a woody stem that supports its climbing growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant in suitable climates."
