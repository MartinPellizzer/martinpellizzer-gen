    "intro": "Solidago vulgaris var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated or toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn, which are arranged in panicle inflorescences. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including dry, sandy, or rocky soils. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
