    "intro": "Sorbus gemella, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Sorbus gemella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact size and seasonal interest."
