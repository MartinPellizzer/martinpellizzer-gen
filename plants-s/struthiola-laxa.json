    "intro": "Struthiola laxa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Struthiola laxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
