    "intro": "Sarracenia flava f. rugelii, commonly known as the rugelii form of the yellow trumpet pitcher plant, is a striking variant of the species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vivid yellow, tubular pitchers that are often adorned with intricate red and orange patterns. The plant is a carnivorous species, using its modified leaves to trap and digest insects. Its pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid that aids in breaking down prey. This form is particularly noted for its robust growth and adaptability to wet, acidic soils in swampy habitats."
