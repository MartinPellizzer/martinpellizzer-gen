    "intro": "Scandentia monodon, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a tropical vine characterized by its long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and trail over other plants. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its flowers are showy, often with vibrant colors such as pink, purple, or white. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Scandentia monodon is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add vertical interest to landscapes."
