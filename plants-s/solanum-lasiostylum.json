    "intro": "Solanum lasiostylum, commonly known as the roughleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
