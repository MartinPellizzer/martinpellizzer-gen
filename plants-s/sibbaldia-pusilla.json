    "intro": "Sibbaldia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. Sibbaldia pusilla is an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
