    "intro": "Struthiopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican woodfern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded forest environments. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Struthiopteris jamaicensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to forest floor cover and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
