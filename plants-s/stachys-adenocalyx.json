    "intro": "Stachys adenocalyx, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
