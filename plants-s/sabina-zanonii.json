The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountainous conditions. Its botanical features include aromatic foliage and a compact growth habit, making it distinct within the Juniperus genus. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
