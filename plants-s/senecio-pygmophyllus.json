    "intro": "Senecio pygmophyllus, commonly known as the dwarf senecio, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
