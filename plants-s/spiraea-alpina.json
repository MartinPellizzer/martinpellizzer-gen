    "intro": "Spiraea alpina, commonly known as the alpine spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features slender stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often hairy. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Spiraea alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its delicate, springtime display."
