    "intro": "Silene wendelboi, commonly known as the Alpine catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and adjacent mountain ranges. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its leaves are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Silene wendelboi is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and low-nutrient environments."
