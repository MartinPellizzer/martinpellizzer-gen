    "intro": "Spiraea esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate blossoms and graceful form."
