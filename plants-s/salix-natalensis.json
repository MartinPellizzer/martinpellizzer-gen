    "intro": "Salix natalensis, commonly known as Natal willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in wet, sandy soils along riverbanks and coastal areas. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in autumn. Natal willow plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
