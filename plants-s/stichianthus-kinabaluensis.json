It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Stichianthus kinabaluensis is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the cool, moist climate of its mountainous habitat."
