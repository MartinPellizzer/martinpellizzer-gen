It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, adding a distinctive appearance to the plant."
