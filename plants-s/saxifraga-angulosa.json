    "intro": "Saxifraga angulosa, commonly known as the angular saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh environments with full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually lobed and have a distinctive angular shape, contributing to its common name. Saxifraga angulosa is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
