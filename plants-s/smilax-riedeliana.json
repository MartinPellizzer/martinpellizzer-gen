    "intro": "Smilax riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's catbrier, is a perennial vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils that aid in climbing and anchoring to supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruits are bright red berries that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. Smilax riedeliana is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local medicine."
