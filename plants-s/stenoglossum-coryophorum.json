It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive narrow lip, which is a key feature in its classification. It thrives in shaded, moist forest understories and is often found in association with other woodland flora. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
