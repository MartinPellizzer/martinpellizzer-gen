    "intro": "Schistocarpaea johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's schistocarpaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bracts that resemble small leaves. Schistocarpaea johnsonii is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for high-elevation ecosystems."
