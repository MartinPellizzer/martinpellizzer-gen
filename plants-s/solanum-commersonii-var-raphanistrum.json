    "intro": "Solanum commersonii var. raphanistrum, commonly known as the wild tomato or desert tomato, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to tomatoes but much smaller in size. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to harsh environments."
