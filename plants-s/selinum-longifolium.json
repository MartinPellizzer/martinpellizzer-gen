    "intro": "Selinum longifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, aromatic leaves. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive silvery coating that reflects sunlight. Selinum longifolium is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
