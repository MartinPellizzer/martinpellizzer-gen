It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with reddish or purplish hues, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh conditions, including drought and frost."
