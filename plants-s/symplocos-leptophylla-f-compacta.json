It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It is native to regions of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
