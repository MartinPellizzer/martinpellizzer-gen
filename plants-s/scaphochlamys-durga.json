    "intro": "Scaphochlamys durga, commonly known as the Durga's hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that resembles a protective covering over the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Scaphochlamys durga is considered endangered and is protected under several conservation initiatives."
