    "intro": "Synaedrys rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are typically reddish in color, which distinguish it from other flax species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall appearance. Synaedrys rufa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
