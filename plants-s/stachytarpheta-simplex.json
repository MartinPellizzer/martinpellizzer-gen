    "intro": "Stachytarpheta simplex, commonly known as purpletop vervain, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of vibrant violet to purple bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Stachytarpheta simplex is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in full sun."
