    "intro": "Saussurea neglecta, commonly known as the Himalayan goa or Indian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in compact clusters. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to high-altitude environments with cold and dry conditions. The plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils."
