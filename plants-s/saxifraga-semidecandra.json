    "intro": "Saxifraga semidecandra, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface, and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it is pollinated primarily by insects. Saxifraga semidecandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
