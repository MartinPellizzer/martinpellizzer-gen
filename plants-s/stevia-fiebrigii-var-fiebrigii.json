    "intro": "Stevia fiebrigii var. fiebrigii, commonly known as the \"sweetleaf\" or \"stevia,\" is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Stevia fiebrigii var. fiebrigii is widely cultivated for its sweetening properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
