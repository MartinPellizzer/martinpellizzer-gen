It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
