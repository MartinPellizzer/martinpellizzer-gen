    "intro": "Salix pseudomonticola, commonly known as the Sierra willow, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Salix pseudomonticola is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes."
