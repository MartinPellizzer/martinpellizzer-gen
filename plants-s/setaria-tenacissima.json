    "intro": "Setaria tenacissima, commonly known as foxtail millet, is an annual grass species native to warm temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, bristly inflorescence that resembles a fox\u2019s tail, giving it its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy crop in arid environments. Its seeds are small and oval, with a pale yellow to brown color, and are used for food, animal feed, and traditional crafts. Setaria tenacissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
