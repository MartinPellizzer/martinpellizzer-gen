    "intro": "Scirpus wightianus, commonly known as Wight's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in clusters at the base of the plant. Scirpus wightianus is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams."
