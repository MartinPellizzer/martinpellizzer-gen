It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
