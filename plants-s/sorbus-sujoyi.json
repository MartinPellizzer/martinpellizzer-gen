    "intro": "Sorbus sujoyi, commonly known as the Bhutanese whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and India. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils at moderate elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
