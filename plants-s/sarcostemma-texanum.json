    "intro": "Sarcostemma texanum, commonly known as Texas milkvine, is a climbing vine native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Sarcostemma texanum is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides in its native range."
