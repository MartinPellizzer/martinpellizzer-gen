    "intro": "Shortia uniflora f. albens, commonly known as the alabaster shortia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often in rich, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred environment. This horticultural form is notable for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in specialty gardens for its ornamental value."
