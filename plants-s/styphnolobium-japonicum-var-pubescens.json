It is characterized by its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen. The variety pubescens is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties of Styphnolobium."
