    "intro": "Stekhovia viscida, commonly known as the sticky stekhovia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give its stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough, leathery surface. Stekhovia viscida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
