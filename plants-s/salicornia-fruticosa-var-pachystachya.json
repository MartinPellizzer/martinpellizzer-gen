    "intro": "Salicornia fruticosa var. pachystachya, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and brackish wetlands, where it tolerates high levels of salinity. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid or salty conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish or reddish, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
