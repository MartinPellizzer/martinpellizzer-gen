    "intro": "Saxifraga hypericoides f. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with upright stems and basal leaves that are typically rounded and hairy. The flowers are small, white to pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its elongated petals, which set it apart from other forms of Saxifraga hypericoides."
