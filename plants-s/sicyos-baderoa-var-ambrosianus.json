    "intro": "Sicyos baderoa var. ambrosianus, commonly known as the Ambrosian giant hogweed, is a variant of the giant hogweed species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a tall, herbaceous plant that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature and potential health risks, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
