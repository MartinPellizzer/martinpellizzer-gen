It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its scientific name \"microphyllus.\" The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in garden settings with minimal maintenance."
