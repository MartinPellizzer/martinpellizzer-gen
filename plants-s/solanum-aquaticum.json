    "intro": "Solanum aquaticum, commonly known as water nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its stems and leaves often submerged or partially submerged. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture, and the plant has a shallow root system adapted to aquatic conditions. Solanum aquaticum is part of the nightshade family, which includes other toxic and economically important plants."
