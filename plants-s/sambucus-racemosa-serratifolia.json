    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa serratifolia, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It features compound leaves with serrated edges, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
