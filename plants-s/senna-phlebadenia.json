    "intro": "Senna phlebadenia, commonly known as the red sand senna, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a small shrub that produces yellow flowers with prominent, winged petals. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
