    "intro": "Saussurea remotifolia, commonly known as the remoteleaf saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizome is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
