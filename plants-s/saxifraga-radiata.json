    "intro": "Saxifraga radiata, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas where the climate is cool and the growing season is short. Saxifraga radiata is a hardy perennial that is popular in rock gardens and alpine gardens due to its ornamental value and resilience."
