    "intro": "Serianthes calycina var. calycina, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, fibrous bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
