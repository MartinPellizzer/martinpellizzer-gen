    "intro": "Semnostachya menglaensis, commonly known as the Mengla orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of pale yellow to orange-red flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
