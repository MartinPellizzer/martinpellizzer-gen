    "intro": "Styphelia hainesii, commonly known as Haines' wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Styphelia hainesii thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
