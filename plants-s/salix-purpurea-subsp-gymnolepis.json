    "intro": "Salix purpurea subsp. gymnolepis, commonly known as the purple willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in wetland habitats."
