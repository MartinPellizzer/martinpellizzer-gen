    "intro": "Sphaeradenia virella, commonly known as the small-leafed stone fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together, forming a dense, compact growth. Its fronds are usually dark green and lack the typical frond structure seen in other ferns, making it distinctive. Sphaeradenia virella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady, moist gardens."
