    "intro": "Stelis dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small, white or pale yellow, and are clustered in a raceme. Stelis dilatata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
