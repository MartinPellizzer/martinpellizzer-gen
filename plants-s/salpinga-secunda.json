    "intro": "Salpinga secunda, commonly known as the second tube flower, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant has a slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salpinga secunda is considered a vulnerable species."
