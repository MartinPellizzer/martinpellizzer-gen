    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 eugenes, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that give it a distinctive drooping appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist environments and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and riparian restoration projects."
