    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 laschiana, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Salix alba and Salix viminalis. It is noted for its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds."
