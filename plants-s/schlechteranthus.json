    "intro": "Schlechteranthus, commonly known as the \"golden cup\" or \"cup flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange-colored ray florets that resemble cups or shallow bowls. The plants typically have a compact growth habit with upright stems and are native to regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. Schlechteranthus species often thrive in dry, sunny environments and are adapted to well-drained soils. Their unique floral structure makes them popular among pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
