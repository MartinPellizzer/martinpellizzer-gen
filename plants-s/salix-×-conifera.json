    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 conifera, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found near water sources."
