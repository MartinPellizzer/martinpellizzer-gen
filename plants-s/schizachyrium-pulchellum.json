    "intro": "Schizachyrium pulchellum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and reddish stems. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental quality to the landscape. Little bluestem is drought-tolerant and plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife in native habitats. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable plant for restoration and conservation projects."
