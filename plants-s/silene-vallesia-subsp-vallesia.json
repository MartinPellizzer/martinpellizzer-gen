It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
