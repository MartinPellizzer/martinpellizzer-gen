    "intro": "Salix taishanensis var. glabra, commonly known as the Tai Shan smooth willow, is a shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are important for pollination. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
