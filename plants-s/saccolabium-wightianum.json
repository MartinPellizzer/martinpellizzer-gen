    "intro": "Saccolabium wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's saccolabium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, adapting to harsh, dry environments with its deep root system. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, leathery pods that contain the seeds. Saccolabium wightianum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
