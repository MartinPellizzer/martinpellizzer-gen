    "intro": "Scorzonera coriacea, commonly known as the rough scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, branched root system that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a valuable forage plant. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of stiff, hairy tissue, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow or orange, with five petals and a central yellow disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. Scorzonera coriacea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
