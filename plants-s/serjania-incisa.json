    "intro": "Serjania incisa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Serjaneae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Serjania incisa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its wood, which is prized in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
