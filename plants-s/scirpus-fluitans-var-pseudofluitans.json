    "intro": "Scirpus fluitans var. pseudofluitans, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often float on the water's surface, supported by air-filled tissues that provide buoyancy. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in shallow waters, forming dense stands. This variant is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to water filtration and habitat for aquatic life."
