It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Silene dichotoma subsp. euxina is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
