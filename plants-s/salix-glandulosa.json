    "intro": "Salix glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in glandular dots. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Salix glandulosa is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist environments."
