    "intro": "Stevia trichopoda, commonly known as sweetleaf or sugarleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Stevia trichopoda is widely cultivated for its sweet-tasting leaves, which are used as a natural alternative to sugar."
