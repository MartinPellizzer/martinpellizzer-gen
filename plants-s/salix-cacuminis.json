    "intro": "Salix cacuminis, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, grayish branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, catkin-like structures that appear in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Salix cacuminis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
