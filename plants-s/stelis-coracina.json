    "intro": "Stelis coracina, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Stelis coracina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
