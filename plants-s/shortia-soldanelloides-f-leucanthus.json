    "intro": "Shortia soldanelloides f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered shortia, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and showy white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, where it thrives in the dappled light of the forest understory. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are clustered in umbels and have a subtle, sweet fragrance. This unique botanical feature makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
