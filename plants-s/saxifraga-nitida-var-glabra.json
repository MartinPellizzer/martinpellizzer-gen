    "intro": "Saxifraga nitida var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a whitish or grayish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, decorative plants."
