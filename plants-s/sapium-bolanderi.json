    "intro": "Sapium bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often unusual floral structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Sapium bolanderi is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
