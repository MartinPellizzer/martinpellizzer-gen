    "intro": "Stelis callosa, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, fleshy stem with a distinctive hairy appearance, which is characteristic of its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip. Stelis callosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
