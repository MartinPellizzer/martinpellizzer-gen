    "intro": "Stapelia inodora, commonly known as the odorless stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, waxy flowers that resemble insect-like structures. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Stapelia inodora is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
