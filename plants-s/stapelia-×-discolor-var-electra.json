    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 discolor var. electra, commonly known as the electric stapelia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are often bright yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
