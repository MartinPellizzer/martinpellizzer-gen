    "intro": "Silene firma f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy firm silene, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is a subspecies of Silene firma and is noted for its ornamental value in gardens."
