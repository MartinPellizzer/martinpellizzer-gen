    "intro": "Saccoglossum, commonly known as the sac-like sea slug, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Sacoglossidae. It is characterized by its elongated, sac-like body that is often transparent or semi-transparent, allowing the internal organs to be visible. The plant-like structures on its body, called cerata, are used for feeding and respiration. Saccoglossum is primarily found in shallow coastal waters and feeds on algae, using a specialized radula to scrape food from surfaces. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in marine ecosystems."
