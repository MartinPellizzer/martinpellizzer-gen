It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with a distinctive, bitter taste. Due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, it is highly toxic and should be handled with care."
