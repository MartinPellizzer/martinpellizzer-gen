    "intro": "Semiaquilegia adoxoides, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It thrives in moist environments, such as wetlands and stream banks, and is characterized by its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer and early autumn. Semiaquilegia adoxoides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
