    "intro": "Shiia fissa, commonly known as the fissured fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds with a deeply divided, fissured appearance. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
