    "intro": "Saxifraga lepida, commonly known as the fairy slipper or dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga lepida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
