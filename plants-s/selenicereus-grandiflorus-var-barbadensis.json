    "intro": "Selenicereus grandiflorus var. barbadensis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators like moths. The plant is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil."
