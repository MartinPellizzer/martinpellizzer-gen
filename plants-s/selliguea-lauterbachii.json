    "intro": "Selliguea lauterbachii, commonly known as the African moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. Selliguea lauterbachii is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid climates and its role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
