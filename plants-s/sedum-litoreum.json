    "intro": "Sedum litoreum, commonly known as sea sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in salty, sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and cliffs. The plant has fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces small, yellow star-shaped flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal landscaping and as a ground cover in dry, sunny areas."
