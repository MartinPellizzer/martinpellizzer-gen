    "intro": "Salix lucida var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland environments and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
