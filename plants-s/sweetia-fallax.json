    "intro": "Sweetia fallax, commonly known as the false sweet potato, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its tuberous roots, while not as commonly cultivated as true sweet potatoes, are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Sweetia fallax is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and delicate flowers."
