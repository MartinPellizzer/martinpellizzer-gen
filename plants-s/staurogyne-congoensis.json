    "intro": "Staurogyne congoensis, commonly known as Congo water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse via water. Staurogyne congoensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
