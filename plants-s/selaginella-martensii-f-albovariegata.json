    "intro": "Selaginella martensii f. albovariegata, commonly known as the variegated spikemoss, is a compact, low-growing evergreen plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, which enhances its ornamental value. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the rosette. It thrives in moist, acidic soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
