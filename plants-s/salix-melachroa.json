    "intro": "Salix melachroa, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks, wetlands, and floodplains. The plant has slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are catkins, which are usually male and female, and they appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is dark and smooth, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
