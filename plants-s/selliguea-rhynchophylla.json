    "intro": "Selliguea rhynchophylla, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or decaying wood. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the phyllids. Selliguea rhynchophylla plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
