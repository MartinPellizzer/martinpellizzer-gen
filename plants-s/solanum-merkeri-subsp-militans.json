    "intro": "Solanum merkeri subsp. militans, commonly known as the military nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in high-altitude regions. It produces small, toxic berries that are used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
