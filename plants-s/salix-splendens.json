    "intro": "Salix splendens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn a striking golden-yellow in the autumn. Salix splendens thrives in moist soils and is often found near waterways, making it a common sight in wetland environments."
