It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with smooth, often reddish stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruits are small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Solanum subelineatum is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
