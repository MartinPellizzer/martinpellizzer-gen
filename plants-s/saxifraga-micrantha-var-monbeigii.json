    "intro": "Saxifraga micrantha var. monbeigii, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It typically features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its delicate nature, it is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in horticulture."
