    "intro": "Sorbus macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is gray and fissured, and it often develops distinctive, flaky exfoliating bark as it matures. Sorbus macrophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
