    "intro": "Spadonia polymorpha var. sordida, commonly known as the sooty spadonia, is a lesser-known fern species characterized by its dark, almost blackish fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low light conditions. The plant's fronds are lanceolate and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive dark coloration that helps it blend into its surroundings. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to humid, temperate climates and its role in maintaining soil stability in forest ecosystems."
