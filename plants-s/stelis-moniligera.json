    "intro": "Stelis moniligera, commonly known as the lace orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns resembling lace. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Stelis moniligera is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
