    "intro": "Stevia bisecta, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are harvested and used as a natural sweetener, making it a popular alternative to sugar. Stevia bisecta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for both ornamental and commercial cultivation."
