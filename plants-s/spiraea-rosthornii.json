    "intro": "Spiraea rosthornii, commonly known as the Rosthorn spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features multiple stems that are often sparsely branched. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on elongated, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin. Spiraea rosthornii is adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
