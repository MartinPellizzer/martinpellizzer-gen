    "intro": "Sorocea ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are leathery and have a distinctive reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Sorocea ilicifolia thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal habitats."
