    "intro": "Solanum hasslerianum var. genuinum, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, serrated leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture but is of interest in botanical studies."
