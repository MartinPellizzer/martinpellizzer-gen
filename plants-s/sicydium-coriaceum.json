It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
