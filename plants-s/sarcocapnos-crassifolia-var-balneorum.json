    "intro": "Sarcocapnos crassifolia var. balneorum, commonly known as the Balneum sarcocapnos, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources."
