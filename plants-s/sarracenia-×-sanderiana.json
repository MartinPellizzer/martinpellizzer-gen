    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures to trap and digest insects. The plant's bright red or orange hues, often with intricate patterns, are adapted to attract prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and ample sunlight for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and ecological studies."
