    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 richenii, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the wetlands of China. It is a hybrid between Salix matsudana and Salix babylonica, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parent species. The plant is notable for its cascading branches that hang in long, drooping clusters, creating a striking visual effect. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wet meadows. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside."
