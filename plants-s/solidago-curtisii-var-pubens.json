    "intro": "Solidago curtisii var. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its specific variety name. The plant produces showy yellow inflorescences in the late summer and early fall, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy habitats. This variant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with rich, organic soil."
