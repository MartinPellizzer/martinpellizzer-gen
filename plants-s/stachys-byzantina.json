    "intro": "Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Carpet Bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Stachys byzantina is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
