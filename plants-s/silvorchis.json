    "intro": "Silvorchis, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments within dense forests. Silvorchis species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers and specialized root systems that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plants usually have strap-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Due to their habitat preferences, many Silvorchis species are threatened by habitat loss and deforestation."
