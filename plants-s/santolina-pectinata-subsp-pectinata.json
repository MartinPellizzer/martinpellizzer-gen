It features compact, low-growing foliage with silvery-gray, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Santolina pectinata subsp. pectinata is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
