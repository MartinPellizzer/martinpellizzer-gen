It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. Its fruits are notable for their ability to produce a soapy foam when crushed, which has been traditionally used for cleaning purposes."
