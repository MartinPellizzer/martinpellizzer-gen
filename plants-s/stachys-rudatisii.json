    "intro": "Stachys rudatisii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Stachys rudatisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and delicate floral display."
