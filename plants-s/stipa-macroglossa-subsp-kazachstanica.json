It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments with low nutrient availability."
