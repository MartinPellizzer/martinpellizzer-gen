    "intro": "Spaniopappus ruckeri, commonly known as the Texas spaniopappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
