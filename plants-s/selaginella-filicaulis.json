    "intro": "Selaginella filicaulis, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique form of resurrection, capable of surviving extreme desiccation and reviving when water becomes available. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant's rhizomes allow it to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil. Its structure and life cycle make it an important subject in the study of plant adaptation and survival strategies."
