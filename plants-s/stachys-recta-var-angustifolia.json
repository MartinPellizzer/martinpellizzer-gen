    "intro": "Stachys recta var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
