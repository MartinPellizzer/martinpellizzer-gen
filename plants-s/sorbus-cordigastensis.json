    "intro": "Sorbus cordigastensis, commonly known as the Transcaucasian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that are typically yellow or red. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
