    "intro": "Sesleria haynaldiana var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender woodland grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a fine texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender flowering stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover in suitable climates."
