    "intro": "Statice minuta var. remotispicula, commonly known as dwarf statice, is a compact, flowering plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring tiny, narrow leaves and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. It is also valued for its use in floral arrangements and as a cut flower."
