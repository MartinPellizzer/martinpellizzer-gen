    "intro": "Scirpus fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges. Scirpus fauriei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
