    "intro": "Solanum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain animals. Its leaves are typically oval with a distinctive net-like vein pattern, contributing to its common name. Solanum reticulatum is often found in dry, open habitats and can be invasive in some regions."
