    "intro": "Solanum balansae var. lyratifidum, commonly known as the lyreleaf nightshade, is a species native to parts of South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
