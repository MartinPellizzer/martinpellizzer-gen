    "intro": "Sabulina sublineata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a rosette structure, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Sabulina sublineata is a member of the Montiaceae family and is often found in tundra and high-altitude habitats."
