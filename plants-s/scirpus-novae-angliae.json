    "intro": "Scirpus novae-angliae, commonly known as the New England bulrush, is a tall, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like clusters of small, white to brown flowers. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies. Scirpus novae-angliae plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
