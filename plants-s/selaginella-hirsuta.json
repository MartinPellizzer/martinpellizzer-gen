    "intro": "Selaginella hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in dry conditions. Its unique morphology and ability to tolerate drought make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
