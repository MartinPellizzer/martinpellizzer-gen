    "intro": "Stannia metensis, commonly known as the silverleaf stannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, silver-haired leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting specific pollinators. Stannia metensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
