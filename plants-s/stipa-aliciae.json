    "intro": "Stipa aliciae, commonly known as the Alicia needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Stipa aliciae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of steppe and grassland ecosystems."
