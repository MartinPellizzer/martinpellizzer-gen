    "intro": "Scorzoneroides autumnalis subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern autumn bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are bell-shaped, typically ranging in color from pale pink to white, and bloom in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
