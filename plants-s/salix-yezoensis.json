    "intro": "Salix yezoensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually yellow-green in hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions. Salix yezoensis is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture."
