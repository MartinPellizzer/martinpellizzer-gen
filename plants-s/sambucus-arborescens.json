    "intro": "Sambucus arborescens, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and has palmately lobed leaves with a serrated edge. Its berries are toxic when unripe but become edible once fully mature, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Sambucus arborescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
