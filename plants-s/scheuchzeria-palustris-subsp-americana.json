    "intro": "Scheuchzeria palustris subsp. americana, commonly known as the American marsh fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally spreading rhizomes and its fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is not closely related to true ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic peat bogs and is adapted to waterlogged soils. It plays a significant ecological role in maintaining the structure and biodiversity of its wetland habitats. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
