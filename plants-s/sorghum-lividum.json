    "intro": "Sorghum lividum, commonly known as the purple false lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets. Sorghum lividum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
