    "intro": "Sorghum sativum, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a highly adaptable plant that thrives in poor soils and requires minimal water, making it a resilient crop for arid environments. The plant produces upright stalks that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny grains. Its seeds, which are rich in carbohydrates and protein, are used for food, animal feed, and even biofuel production. Sorghum sativum is also valued for its ability to withstand drought and its role in sustainable agriculture."
