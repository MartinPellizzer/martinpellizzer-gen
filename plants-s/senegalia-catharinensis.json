    "intro": "Senegalia catharinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian burr legume, is a shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny pods. The plant is adapted to dry, tropical climates and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Senegalia catharinensis is also valued for its potential in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
