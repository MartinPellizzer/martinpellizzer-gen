    "intro": "Selaginella squamifolia, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and sporophyte phase. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of certain ecosystems."
