    "intro": "Scleropyrum mekongense, commonly known as the Mekong boxwood, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Mekong River basin. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
