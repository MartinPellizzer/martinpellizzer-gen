    "intro": "Sedum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to North America. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Sedum dentatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
