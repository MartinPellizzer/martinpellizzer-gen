    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia var. mollis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. This variety is closely related to other saxifrage species and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
