    "intro": "Sideroxylon rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaf ironwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland forested areas. The leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
