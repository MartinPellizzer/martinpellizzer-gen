It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
