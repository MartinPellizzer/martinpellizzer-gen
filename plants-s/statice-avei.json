    "intro": "Statice avei, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, salt-tolerant growth habit and its showy, pink to purple flower heads. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Statice avei is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value."
