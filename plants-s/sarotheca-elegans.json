It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Sarotheca elegans thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
