    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos unijuga, commonly known as the single-jug star, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features a single, spherical flower head composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow florets arranged in a star-like pattern. Its leaves are narrow and pinnate, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sphaerostephanos unijuga is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
