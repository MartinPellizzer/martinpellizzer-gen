It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain numerous seeds. Senna caudata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of dye."
