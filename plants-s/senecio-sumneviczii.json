    "intro": "Senecio sumneviczii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is a perennial herb with a mat-forming growth habit, characterized by its dense cluster of basal leaves and slender, flowering stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
