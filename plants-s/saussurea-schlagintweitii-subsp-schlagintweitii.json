    "intro": "Saussurea schlagintweitii subsp. schlagintweitii, commonly known as the Afghan gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow to orange in color and bloom during the summer months."
