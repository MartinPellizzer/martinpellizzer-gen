    "intro": "Scutellaria paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox scutellaria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. Scutellaria paradoxa is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
