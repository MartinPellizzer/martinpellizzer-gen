    "intro": "Selinum mandenovae, commonly known as the Siberian parsley, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Russia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
