    "intro": "Sticherus orthocladus, commonly known as the upright sticherus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy shoot system, and its leaves are usually arranged in a dense, overlapping manner. Sticherus orthocladus is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its role in soil stabilization. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage and produce spores for propagation."
