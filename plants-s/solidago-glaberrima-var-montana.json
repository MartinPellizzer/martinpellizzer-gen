It is characterized by its hairy stems and clustered, yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. Mountain goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late season."
