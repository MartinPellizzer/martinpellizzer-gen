    "intro": "Spennera dichotoma var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf spennera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
