    "intro": "Steffensia tuberculata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed steffensia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
