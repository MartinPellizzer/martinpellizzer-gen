    "intro": "Sobralia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping sobralia, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that often wraps around tree trunks, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of tropical flora."
