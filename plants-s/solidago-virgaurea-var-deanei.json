    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. deanei, commonly known as the Deane's goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks. The plant features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn, are arranged in dense, panicle-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
