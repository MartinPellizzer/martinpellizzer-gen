    "intro": "Schedonorus nutans, commonly known as the nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive nodding inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in early summer. Schedonorus nutans is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates."
