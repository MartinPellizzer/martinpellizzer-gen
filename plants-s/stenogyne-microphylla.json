    "intro": "Stenogyne microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests and streamside habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
