    "intro": "Sida tenax, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming throughout the growing season. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. Sida tenax is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
