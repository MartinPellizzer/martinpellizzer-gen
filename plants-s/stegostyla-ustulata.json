    "intro": "Stegostyla ustulata, commonly known as the waxy leaf water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water surface. Stegostyla ustulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
