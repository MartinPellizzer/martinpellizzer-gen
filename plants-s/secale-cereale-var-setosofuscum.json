    "intro": "Secale cereale var. setosofuscum, commonly known as the black rye or a variant of rye, is a less commonly cultivated form of rye characterized by its dark-colored grains and unique morphological traits. This variety exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to standard rye, with shorter and stiffer inflorescences. Its leaves are typically darker green and have a coarser texture, contributing to its distinct appearance. The plant is adapted to cooler climates and is often found in temperate regions with well-drained soils. Due to its specific traits, it is of interest in botanical studies and has limited use in agriculture."
