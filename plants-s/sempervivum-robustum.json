    "intro": "Sempervivum robustum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, often bluish-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sempervivum robustum is also known for its hardiness and ability to form dense mats over time."
