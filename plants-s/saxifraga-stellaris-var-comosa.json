    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. comosa, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help to retain moisture in harsh environments. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to cold, rocky habitats. It is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
