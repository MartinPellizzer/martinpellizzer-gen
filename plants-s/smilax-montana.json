    "intro": "Smilax montana, commonly known as the mountain smilax, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and anchor itself to trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a pointed tip and a rough texture. Smilax montana is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
