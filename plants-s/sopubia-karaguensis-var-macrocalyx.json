    "intro": "Sopubia karaguensis var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered sopubia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, reducing water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens and landscapes."
