    "intro": "Styphelia montana, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Styphelia montana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural conditions."
