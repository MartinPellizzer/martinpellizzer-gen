    "intro": "Salacia viridiramis, commonly known as the emerald-veined evergreen, is a tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy green leaves with intricate, vein-like patterns that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, Salacia viridiramis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
