    "intro": "Saussurea reinii, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and pale yellow to brownish flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in its arid and mountainous habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Saussurea reinii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its native environment."
