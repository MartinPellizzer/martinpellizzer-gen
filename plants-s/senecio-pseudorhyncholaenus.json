    "intro": "Senecio pseudorhyncholaenus, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across its native range. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
