    "intro": "Sphacophyllum lastii, commonly known as the lastii liverwort, is a type of moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a dense, greenish-yellow appearance with a flattened thallus and is often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Sphacophyllum lastii is characterized by its ability to retain water, which helps it survive in humid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
