    "intro": "Solanum graciliflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. Solanum graciliflorum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant taxonomy and ecology."
