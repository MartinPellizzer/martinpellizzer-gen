    "intro": "Styphelia spuria, commonly known as the slender sandpiper plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Styphelia spuria is an important component of coastal heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
