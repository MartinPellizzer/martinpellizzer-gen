    "intro": "Selago rudolphii, commonly known as the Natal sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes covered with fine hairs, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Selago rudolphii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
