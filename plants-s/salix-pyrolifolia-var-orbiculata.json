    "intro": "Salix pyrolifolia var. orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaf willow, is a variant of the narrowleaf willow. It is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features slender, woody stems with opposite, oval to round leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically male, and it produces small, woody fruits called samaras. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
