    "intro": "Salix forbesiana, commonly known as Forbes' willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. Forbes' willow thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
