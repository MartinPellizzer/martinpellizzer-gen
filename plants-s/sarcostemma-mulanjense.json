    "intro": "Sarcostemma mulanjense, commonly known as the Mulanje moonvine, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Malawi. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Sarcostemma mulanjense is adapted to grow in rocky and limestone soils, often found in humid, shaded environments."
