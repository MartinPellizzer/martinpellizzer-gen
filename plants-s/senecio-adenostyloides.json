    "intro": "Senecio adenostyloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It features succulent, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
