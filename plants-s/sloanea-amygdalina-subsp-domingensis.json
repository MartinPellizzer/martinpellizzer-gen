    "intro": "Sloanea amygdalina subsp. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican mahogany, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica and other islands in the Lesser Antilles. The plant is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its ecological and economic significance, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
