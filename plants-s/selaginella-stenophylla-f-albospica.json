    "intro": "Selaginella stenophylla f. albospica, commonly known as the white-spined clubmoss, is a rare and distinctive fern ally native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are typically white or pale in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
