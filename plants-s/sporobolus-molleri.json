    "intro": "Sporobolus molleri, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a grass species characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Sporobolus molleri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
