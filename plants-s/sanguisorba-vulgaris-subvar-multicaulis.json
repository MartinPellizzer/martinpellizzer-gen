    "intro": "Sanguisorba vulgaris subvar. multicaulis, commonly known as the common dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Sanguisorba vulgaris subvar. multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
