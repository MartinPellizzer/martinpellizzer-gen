    "intro": "Spigelia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's spigelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Spigelia palmeri is also notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the seed pods explosively release seeds upon maturity."
