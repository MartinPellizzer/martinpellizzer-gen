It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale blue in color. Schizococcus nissenianus is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can be found in regions such as North Africa and the Middle East."
