It features upright, branching stems covered in fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
