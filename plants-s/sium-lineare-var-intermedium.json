It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. It plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
