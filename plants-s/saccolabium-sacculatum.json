    "intro": "Saccolabium sacculatum, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Saccolabium sacculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
