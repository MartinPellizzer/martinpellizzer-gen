    "intro": "Sclerocactus wetlandicus, commonly known as the wetland spine cactus, is a rare and specialized cactus species adapted to wetland environments. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive moisture loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the saturated soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Sclerocactus wetlandicus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
