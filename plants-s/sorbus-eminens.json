    "intro": "Sorbus eminens, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of rocky and forested areas."
