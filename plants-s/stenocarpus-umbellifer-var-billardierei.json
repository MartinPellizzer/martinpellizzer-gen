    "intro": "Stenocarpus umbellifer var. billardierei, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing drought tolerance, while its flowers are often visited by native bees and birds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
