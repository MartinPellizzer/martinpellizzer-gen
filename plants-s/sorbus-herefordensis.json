    "intro": "Sorbus herefordensis, commonly known as Hereford rowan, is a small deciduous tree native to the UK. It is characterized by its white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces distinctive, clustered fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
