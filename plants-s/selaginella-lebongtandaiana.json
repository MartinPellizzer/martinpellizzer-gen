    "intro": "Selaginella lebongtandaiana, commonly known as the Lebong Tandaiana spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss found in the montane rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, moss-like structure with small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized reproductive structures. It typically grows on rocky substrates and is often found in shaded, humid habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
