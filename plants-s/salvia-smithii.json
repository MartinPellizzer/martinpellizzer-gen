It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
