    "intro": "Statice effusa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and along shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Statice effusa is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a symbol of resilience in challenging environments."
