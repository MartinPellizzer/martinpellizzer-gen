It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its compact shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible when ripe, though they can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, sunny climates. Solanum rubidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its potential culinary uses."
