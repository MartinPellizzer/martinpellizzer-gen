    "intro": "Senegalia manubensis, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often shed during dry periods, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which have been used by local communities for food and traditional medicine. Senegalia manubensis is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions. It also plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
