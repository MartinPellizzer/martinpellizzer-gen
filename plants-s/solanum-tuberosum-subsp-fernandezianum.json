    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum subsp. fernandezianum, commonly known as the Fernandezian potato, is a lesser-known subspecies of the potato plant. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. This subspecies is characterized by its small, tuberous roots and distinct foliage with a more compact growth habit compared to the common potato. It exhibits a range of flower colors, including white, purple, and pink, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and underutilized species in agricultural contexts."
