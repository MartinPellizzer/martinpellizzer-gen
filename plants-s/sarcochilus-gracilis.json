    "intro": "Sarcochilus gracilis, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests or under dense vegetation. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival during dry periods. Sarcochilus gracilis is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
