    "intro": "Struthiopteris spicant var. pradae, commonly known as the Prada's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often serrated along the edges. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. The spores are produced in fertile fronds that develop toward the tips of the plant, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
