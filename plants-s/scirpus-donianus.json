It typically grows in shallow waters, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. The flowering spikes are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes, a characteristic known as dioecious."
