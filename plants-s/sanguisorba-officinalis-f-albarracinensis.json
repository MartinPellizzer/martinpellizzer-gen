    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis f. albarracinensis, commonly known as the white-stemmed lady's fingers, is a rare botanical variant of the common sweet everlasting. It is characterized by its pale green to white stems and reduced leaf morphology compared to the typical form. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Spain, where it thrives in rocky or dry habitats. Its flowers, while similar to the parent species, are often smaller and less showy. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
