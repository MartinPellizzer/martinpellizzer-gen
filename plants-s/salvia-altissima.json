    "intro": "Salvia altissima, commonly known as tall beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, supporting clusters of violet-blue to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of down, giving them a soft texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
