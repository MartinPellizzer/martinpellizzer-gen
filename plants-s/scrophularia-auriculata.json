    "intro": "Scrophularia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are tubular with two lips, resembling those of other figwort family members. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Scrophularia auriculata is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
