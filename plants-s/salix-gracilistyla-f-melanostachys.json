    "intro": "Salix gracilistyla f. melanostachys, commonly known as the black-stamen willow, is a unique variant of the slender willow. It is characterized by its dark-colored stamens, which distinguish it from other willow species. This shrub typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often near streams or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
