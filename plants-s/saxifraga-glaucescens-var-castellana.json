It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, arid environments."
