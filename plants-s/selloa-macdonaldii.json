    "intro": "Selloa macdonaldii, commonly known as the MacDonald's selloa, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Selloa macdonaldii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive periods of drought. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline."
