    "intro": "Sorghum heteroclitum, commonly known as the red sorghum, is a grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, reddish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in traditional farming and as a forage crop."
