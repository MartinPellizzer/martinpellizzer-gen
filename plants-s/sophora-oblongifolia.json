    "intro": "Sophora oblongifolia, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces striking blue to purple pea-like flowers in early summer, which are followed by long, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
