    "intro": "Silene keiskei, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique ability to survive in harsh, salty environments, often growing on rocky shores and dunes. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against strong winds. Silene keiskei is also known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, with flowers appearing only briefly before wilting."
