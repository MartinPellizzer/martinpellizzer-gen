    "intro": "Sinapis arvensis var. retrohirsuta, commonly known as hairy\u7530\u91ce mustard, is a variant of the field mustard species native to Europe. It is an annual herb characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its seeds are small and spherical, often containing glucosinolates, which are defensive compounds against herbivores. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
