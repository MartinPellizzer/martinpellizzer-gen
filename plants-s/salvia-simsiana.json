    "intro": "Salvia simsiana, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. Salvia simsiana also attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
