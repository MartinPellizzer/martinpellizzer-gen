    "intro": "Spiranthes lindmaniana, commonly known as the Lindman's spiral orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of flowers along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a delicate, spiral-like pattern that gives it its common name. It produces small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
