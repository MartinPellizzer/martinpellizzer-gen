    "intro": "Spondias angolensis, commonly known as the African satinash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the rainy season. Its fruit is a drupe, typically yellow or orange when ripe, and is edible, though some varieties may have a mild toxicity. The plant is often found in savannas and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
