    "intro": "Siphocampylus ruber, commonly known as the red-leafed siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage and small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are often densely packed and have a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
