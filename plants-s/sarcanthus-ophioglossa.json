    "intro": "Sarcanthus ophioglossa, commonly known as the lesser sword fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
