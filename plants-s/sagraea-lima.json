It is an annual legume that produces pods containing edible seeds, which are widely used in global cuisine. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers. Its root system fixes nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable crop for soil enrichment. The seeds are rich in protein and are cultivated for both human consumption and animal feed."
