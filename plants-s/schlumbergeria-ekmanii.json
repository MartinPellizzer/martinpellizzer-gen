    "intro": "[WRONG START] Schlumbergereria ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that form a branching, bushy structure. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the winter months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schlumbergeria ekmanii is a popular ornamental plant due to its long blooming period and ease of care."
