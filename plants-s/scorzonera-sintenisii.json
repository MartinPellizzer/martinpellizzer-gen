    "intro": "Scorzonera sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' scorzonera, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a distinctive, often hairy texture. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers, which bloom in summer and attract various pollinators. Scorzonera sintenisii is known for its robust root system, which can grow quite deep, and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
