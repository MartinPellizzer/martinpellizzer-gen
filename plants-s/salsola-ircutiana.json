    "intro": "Salsola ircutiana, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is an annual or biennial plant native to Eurasia and is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh conditions and is sometimes considered a weed. Salsola ircutiana is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind."
