    "intro": "Salix chlorophylla var. pellita, commonly known as the pale chlorophyll willow, is a variant of the chlorophyll willow, characterized by its reduced chlorophyll content in its leaves. This plant belongs to the Salicaceae family and is typically found in moist, temperate regions. Its leaves are narrow and often exhibit a pale green to almost white coloration due to the lower chlorophyll concentration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical catkins. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
