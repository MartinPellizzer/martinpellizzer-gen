    "intro": "Salvia candelabriformis, commonly known as the candlestick sage, is a striking perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive, candle-like inflorescences that consist of dense clusters of violet-blue flowers. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to both garden landscapes and native plant collections."
