    "intro": "Scirpus pauciflorus f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a rare and diminutive variant of the bulrush genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced floral structures compared to the typical species. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps near the water's edge. The inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination."
