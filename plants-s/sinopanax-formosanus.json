    "intro": "Sinopanax formosanus, commonly known as the Taiwan arrowhead plant, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound, pinnately arranged leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
