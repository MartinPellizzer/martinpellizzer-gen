    "intro": "Selaginella mettenii, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its whorled arrangement of leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage, with the sporophyte producing spores on specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella mettenii is also noted for its ability to survive in adverse conditions, making it a resilient and adaptive species."
