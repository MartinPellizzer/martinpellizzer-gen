    "intro": "Sorbus aria, commonly known as whitebeam, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges. The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, adding to its distinctive appearance."
