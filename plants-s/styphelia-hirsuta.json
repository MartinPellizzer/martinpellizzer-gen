    "intro": "Styphelia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy whorled greenbriar, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Styphelia hirsuta thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
