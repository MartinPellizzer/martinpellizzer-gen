    "intro": "Stenocereus eichlamii, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with ribbed structures and spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Stenocereus eichlamii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem to survive prolonged droughts."
