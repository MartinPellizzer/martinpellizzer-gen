    "intro": "Saxifraga crassicarpa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas where the climate is cold and the growing season is short. The plant features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help to insulate it against harsh weather conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. The leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in environments where moisture is scarce."
