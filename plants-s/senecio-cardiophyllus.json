    "intro": "Senecio cardiophyllus, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
