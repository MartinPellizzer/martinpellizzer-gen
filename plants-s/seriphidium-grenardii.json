    "intro": "Seriphidium grenardii, commonly known as Grenard's wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Seriphidium grenardii produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
