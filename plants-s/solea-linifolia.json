    "intro": "Solea linifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf sole, is a marine flatfish native to the Atlantic Ocean. It has a distinctive silver sheen on its upper side and a pale, often mottled underside. The species is characterized by its flattened body shape, which allows it to lie on its side on the seafloor. Its skin is covered in small, scaleless patches that provide camouflage in its natural habitat. The fish is typically found in sandy or muddy substrates at depths ranging from 10 to 200 meters."
