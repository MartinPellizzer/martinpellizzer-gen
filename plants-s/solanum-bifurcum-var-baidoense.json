    "intro": "Solanum bifurcum var. baidoense, commonly known as the Baidoense nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit, which is typically a small, fleshy berry, contains seeds and is often used in traditional medicine. However, like many members of its family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
