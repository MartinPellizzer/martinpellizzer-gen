    "intro": "Sphaeroma julii, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in the Mediterranean Sea. It belongs to the family Aeolidiidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body covered in a layer of mucus. The plant-like appearance of Sphaeroma julii is due to its ability to secrete a gelatinous substance that resembles algae. It feeds on sponges and other marine organisms, using its radula to rasp food from surfaces. Despite its name, it is not a true plant but a marine gastropod mollusk with unique botanical-like features."
