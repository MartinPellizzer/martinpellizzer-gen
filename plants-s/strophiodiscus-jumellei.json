    "intro": "Strophiodiscus jumellei, commonly known as the golden star water moss, is a species of freshwater green algae belonging to the Chlorophyceae class. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow coloration, which is due to the presence of carotenoids. The plant forms dense, floating mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies. It has a filamentous structure composed of branching, cylindrical cells that are often covered in small, star-shaped projections. Strophiodiscus jumellei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
