    "intro": "Symplocos robinsonii var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy symplocos, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage, with leaves that are typically elliptical and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by berries that mature to a dark red color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this variant."
