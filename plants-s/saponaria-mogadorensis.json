    "intro": "Saponaria mogadorensis, commonly known as the Mogador soapwort, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are often covered in a soapy substance when crushed, giving it its common name. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
