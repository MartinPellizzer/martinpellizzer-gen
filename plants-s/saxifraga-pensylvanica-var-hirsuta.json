    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rockfoam, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, such as stream banks and woodland edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences at the tips of the stems. This variety is characterized by its hirsute (hairy) foliage, which distinguishes it from other members of the Saxifraga genus."
