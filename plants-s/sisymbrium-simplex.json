    "intro": "Sisymbrium simplex, commonly known as the narrowleaf winter cress, is an annual flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped and hairy. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring, followed by the production of slender, pod-like fruits that release tiny seeds. Sisymbrium simplex is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural fields."
