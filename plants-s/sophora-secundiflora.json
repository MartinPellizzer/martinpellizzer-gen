    "intro": "Sophora secundiflora, commonly known as the Texas rainflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are dispersed when the pods dry and split open. Sophora secundiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for native pollinators."
