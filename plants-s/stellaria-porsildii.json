    "intro": "Stellaria porsildii, commonly known as the Arctic starwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a creeping habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh conditions. Stellaria porsildii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its alpine and tundra habitats."
