It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in mangrove areas. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Sorema litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
