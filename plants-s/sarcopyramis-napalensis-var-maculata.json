It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating, and the varietal name \"maculata\" refers to the distinctive spotted or mottled pattern on its foliage. This species is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
