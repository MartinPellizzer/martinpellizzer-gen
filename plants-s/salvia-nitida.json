    "intro": "Salvia nitida, commonly known as silver sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia nitida is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
