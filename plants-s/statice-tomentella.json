    "intro": "Statice tomentella, commonly known as woolly glasswort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in dunes and tidal marshes. Statice tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
