    "intro": "Solanum aculeatum f. typicum, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. Its botanical features include hairy foliage and a distinctive, aromatic scent. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a weed in some agricultural regions."
