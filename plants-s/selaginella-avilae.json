It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with a prostrate stem and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. Selaginella avilae is notable for its ability to reproduce via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. This plant is also recognized for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
