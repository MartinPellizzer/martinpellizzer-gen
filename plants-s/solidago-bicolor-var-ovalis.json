    "intro": "Solidago bicolor var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaved goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its lanceolate to ovate leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The oval-leaved goldenrod is an important nectar source for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
