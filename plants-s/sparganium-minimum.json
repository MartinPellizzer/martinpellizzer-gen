    "intro": "Sparganium minimum, commonly known as the lesser bur-reed, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spiky, woody fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Sparganium minimum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
