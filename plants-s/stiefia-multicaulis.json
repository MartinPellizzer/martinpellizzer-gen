    "intro": "Stiefia multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered stiefia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with multiple stems emerging from a central base. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Stiefia multicaulis is notable for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments and support local biodiversity."
