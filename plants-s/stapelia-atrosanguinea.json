    "intro": "Stapelia atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fleshy stems that store water, typical of many succulents. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are usually orange to reddish in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for arid environments."
