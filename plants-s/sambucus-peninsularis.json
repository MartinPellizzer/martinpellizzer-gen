    "intro": "Sambucus peninsularis, commonly known as the Florida elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity. Sambucus peninsularis is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
