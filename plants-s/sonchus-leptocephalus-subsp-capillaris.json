It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is characterized by its upright stem and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy texture.
