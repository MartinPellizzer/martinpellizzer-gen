    "intro": "Saxifraga hieraciifolia subsp. czukczorum, commonly known as the Czukczer saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
