    "intro": "Saxifraga galacifolia, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-gray leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga galacifolia is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
