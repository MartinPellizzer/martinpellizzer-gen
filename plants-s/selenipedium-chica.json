    "intro": "Selenipedium chica, commonly known as the giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, spindly stem and large, showy flowers that resemble spiders. The plant produces large, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns, and it blooms infrequently, typically once every few years. Selenipedium chica is known for its slow growth and is often found growing in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and habitat destruction, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
