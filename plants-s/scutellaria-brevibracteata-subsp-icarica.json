It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its small, ovate bracts that are shorter than the calyx, giving it its specific epithet. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
