It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, arranged in dense rosettes. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
