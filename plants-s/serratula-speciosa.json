    "intro": "Serratula speciosa, commonly known as the showy golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has serrated leaves and a branched stem, which are typical features of the genus Serratula. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
