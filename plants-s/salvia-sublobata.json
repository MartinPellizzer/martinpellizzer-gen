    "intro": "Salvia sublobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in grayish-white hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia sublobata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
