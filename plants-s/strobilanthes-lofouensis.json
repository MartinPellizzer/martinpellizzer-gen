    "intro": "Strobilanthes lofouensis, commonly known as the Lofou endemic or Lofou's strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to the island of Vanuatu. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the tropical rainforests of the South Pacific. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its flowers display vibrant colors, often in shades of red and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
