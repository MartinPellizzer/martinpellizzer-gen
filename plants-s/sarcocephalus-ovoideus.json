It is characterized by its distinctive, egg-shaped, fleshy fruits that are typically green when mature and turn yellow or red when ripe. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
