    "intro": "Stylotrichium, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery foliage and small, pod-like fruits. The leaves are typically compound, with a unique arrangement of small, stiff, hair-like structures called trichomes. Stylotrichium species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are adapted to thrive in poor soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
