    "intro": "Shortia uniflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower shortia, is a rare and endangered herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and a single, showy white or pink flower that blooms in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils within shaded forest understories. Its reproductive system relies on specific pollinators, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
