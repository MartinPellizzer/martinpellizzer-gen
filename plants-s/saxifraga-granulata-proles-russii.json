    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata proles russii, commonly known as the Russian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga granulata proles russii is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
