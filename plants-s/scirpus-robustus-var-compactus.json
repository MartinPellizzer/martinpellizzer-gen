    "intro": "Scirpus robustus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its compact form and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in wetland ecosystems."
