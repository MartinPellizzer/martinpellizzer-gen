    "intro": "Sophronitis reginae, commonly known as the Queen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive greenish tinge. The plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence that bears several blooms, each with a unique, intricate pattern of markings. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sophronitis reginae is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
