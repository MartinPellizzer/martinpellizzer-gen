    "intro": "Suaeda corniculata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sea bladder, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, green leaves that store water, typical of plants in arid or coastal regions. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and salt marshes. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in high-salinity and low-nutrient conditions."
