    "intro": "Sempervivum compactum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. Its ability to form offsets, or \"chicks,\" makes it easy to propagate and maintain. Sempervivum compactum is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
