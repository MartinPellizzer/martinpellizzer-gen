    "intro": "Syngonanthus bisumbellatus var. bisumbellatus, commonly known as the two-branched clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense clusters of spirally arranged leaves. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its unique branching pattern and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
