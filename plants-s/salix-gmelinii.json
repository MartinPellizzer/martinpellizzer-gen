    "intro": "Salix gmelinii, commonly known as the Mongolian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, and it produces catkins as its reproductive structures. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and mountainous regions. Salix gmelinii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
