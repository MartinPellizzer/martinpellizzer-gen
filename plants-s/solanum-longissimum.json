    "intro": "Solanum longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple in color. Its berries are initially green and turn red when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and requires caution when handling."
