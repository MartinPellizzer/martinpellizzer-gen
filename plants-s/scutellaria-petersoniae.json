    "intro": "Scutellaria petersoniae, commonly known as Peterson's bluehead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
