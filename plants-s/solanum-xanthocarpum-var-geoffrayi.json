    "intro": "Solanum xanthocarpum var. geoffrayi, commonly known as Geoffray's yellow fruit morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that are edible but have a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and twining. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
