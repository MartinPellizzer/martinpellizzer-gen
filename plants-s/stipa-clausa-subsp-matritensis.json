    "intro": "Stipa clausa subsp. matritensis, commonly known as the Matritensis needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
