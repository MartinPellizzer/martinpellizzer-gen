It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features dense, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The flowers, which can be red, orange, or yellow, are pollinated by hummingbirds and other insects."
