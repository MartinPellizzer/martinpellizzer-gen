    "intro": "Steveniella satyrioides var. iranica, commonly known as the Persian satyr orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Iran. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles the shape of a satyr, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and receives partial sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
