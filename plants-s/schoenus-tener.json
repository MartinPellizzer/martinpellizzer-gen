    "intro": "Schoenus tener, commonly known as the soft grass or slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Schoenus tener produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems."
