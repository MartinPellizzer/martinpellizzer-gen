It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and containers."
