    "intro": "Spiranthes lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's spiral orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and swampy areas. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown seed pods after flowering. This species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
