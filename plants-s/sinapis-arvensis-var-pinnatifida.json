    "intro": "Sinapis arvensis var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved mustard, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately divided leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
