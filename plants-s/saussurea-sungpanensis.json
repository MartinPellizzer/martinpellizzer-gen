    "intro": "Saussurea sungpanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Saussurea sungpanensis is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
