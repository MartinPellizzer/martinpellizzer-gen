    "intro": "Solanum thomasiifolium var. lobatum, commonly known as the lobate nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lobed, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct serrated edge. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
