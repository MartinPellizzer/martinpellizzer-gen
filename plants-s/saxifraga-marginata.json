    "intro": "Saxifraga marginata, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Saxifraga marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
