    "intro": "Schoenus rugosus, commonly known as the rough sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Schoenus rugosus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
