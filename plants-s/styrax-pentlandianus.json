    "intro": "Styrax pentlandianus, commonly known as the purple styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy, dark green surface. Styrax pentlandianus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
