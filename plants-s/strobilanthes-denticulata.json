    "intro": "Strobilanthes denticulata, commonly known as the \"Kangkong flower\" or \"Ceylon flame,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing as a fiery display during the dry season. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in open areas with well-drained soil. Strobilanthes denticulata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in certain regions."
