    "intro": "Sparganium neglectum var. subsimplex, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burrweed, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed heads that help in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
