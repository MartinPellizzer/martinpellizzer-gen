    "intro": "Schleinitzia insularum, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and rare plant native to the Socotra Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It is a coniferous tree characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and twisted, gnarled trunk. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely packed, giving it a dense appearance. It thrives in the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat, showing remarkable adaptations to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
