    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
