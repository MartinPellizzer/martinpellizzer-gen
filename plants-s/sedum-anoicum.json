    "intro": "Sedum anoicum, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Sedum anoicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
