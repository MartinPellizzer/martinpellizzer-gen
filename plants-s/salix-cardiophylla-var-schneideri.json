    "intro": "Salix cardiophylla var. schneideri, commonly known as Schneider's willow, is a variant of the heart-leaved willow native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as riverbanks and wet meadows. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological succession. The species exhibits adaptations to its habitat, including flexible stems and efficient water retention mechanisms."
