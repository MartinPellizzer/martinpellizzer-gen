    "intro": "Sciaphila subhermaphrodita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique ability to produce both male and female reproductive structures on the same flower, a trait known as hermaphroditism. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing epiphytically on trees or rocks. Its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers are adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
