    "intro": "Stenactis annua, commonly known as the annual stenactis, is an annual flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Stenactis annua is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
