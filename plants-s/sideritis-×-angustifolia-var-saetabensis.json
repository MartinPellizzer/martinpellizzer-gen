    "intro": "Sideritis \u00d7 angustifolia var. saetabensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
