    "intro": "Saxifraga pallida var. monbeigii, commonly known as the pale saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
