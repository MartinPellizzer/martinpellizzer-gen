It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Scutellaria intermedia is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and antispasmodic properties."
