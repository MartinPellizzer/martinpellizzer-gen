    "intro": "Spiraea pseudocrenata, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring arching stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. Spiraea pseudocrenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
