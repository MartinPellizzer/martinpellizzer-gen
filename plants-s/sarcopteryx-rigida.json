    "intro": "Sarcopteryx rigida, commonly known as the rigid sarcoteryx, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its distinctive leaf structures and often vibrant floral displays. The plant features upright, woody stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and typically exhibit shades of red or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcopteryx rigida is considered a species of conservation concern."
