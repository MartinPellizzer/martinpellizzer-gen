    "intro": "Sonchus macranthus, commonly known as the giant sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
