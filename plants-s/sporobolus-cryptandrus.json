    "intro": "Sporobolus cryptandrus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Sporobolus cryptandrus is drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
