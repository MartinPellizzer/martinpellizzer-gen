    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 cythereis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Serapias acaulis and Serapias orchidioides. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. Serapias \u00d7 cythereis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
