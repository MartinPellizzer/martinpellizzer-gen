    "intro": "Sinapis arvensis, commonly known as field mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. The plant produces long, slender pods called siliques that contain numerous small, round seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Field mustard is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural fields."
