    "intro": "Sannantha bidwillii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking perennial herb native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study. Sannantha bidwillii is also noted for its medicinal properties and historical use by Indigenous Australians."
