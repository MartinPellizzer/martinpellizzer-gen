It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that split open to release its seeds.

The plant is often found in forest understories and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
