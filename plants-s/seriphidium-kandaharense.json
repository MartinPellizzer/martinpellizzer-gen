    "intro": "Seriphidium kandaharense, commonly known as the Kandahar dwarf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
