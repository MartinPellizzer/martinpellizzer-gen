    "intro": "Senra nubica var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alpine senra, is a compact, low-growing plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely arranged along its stems, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
