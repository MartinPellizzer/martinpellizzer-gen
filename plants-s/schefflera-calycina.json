    "intro": "Schefflera calycina, commonly known as the laceleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage, with leaves that are typically palmately lobed and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Schefflera calycina is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
