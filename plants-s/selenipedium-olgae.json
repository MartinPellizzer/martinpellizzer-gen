    "intro": "Selenipedium olgae, commonly known as the Olgas' ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in length, bearing numerous pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree trunks and branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a very limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat destruction and its rarity, Selenipedium olgae is considered critically endangered."
