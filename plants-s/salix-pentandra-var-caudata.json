    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. caudata, commonly known as the willow-leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive willow-like appearance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
