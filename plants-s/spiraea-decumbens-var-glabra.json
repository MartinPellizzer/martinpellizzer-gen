    "intro": "Spiraea decumbens var. glabra, commonly known as smooth spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on the tips of the stems. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
