    "intro": "Staphidiastrum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the understory of shaded forests in tropical regions. It possesses finely divided, arching fronds that create a dense, fern-like appearance, adapted to low-light conditions. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in moist, organic-rich soils. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, humid environments."
