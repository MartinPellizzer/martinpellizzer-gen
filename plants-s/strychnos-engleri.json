    "intro": "Strychnos engleri, commonly known as the African bitter apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its fruit is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine, which make it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
