    "intro": "Salix oreophila, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a deciduous shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Salix oreophila thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various alpine fauna and contributing to soil stabilization in mountainous regions."
