    "intro": "Sporobolus homblei, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has wiry, bristly stems and spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, a feature that aids in its survival and spread across sandy and rocky soils. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Sporobolus homblei plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
