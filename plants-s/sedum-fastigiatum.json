    "intro": "Sedum fastigiatum, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features compact, upright growth with fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and requires minimal water once established. Sedum fastigiatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
