    "intro": "Sciaphila thomassetii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. Sciaphila thomassetii requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
