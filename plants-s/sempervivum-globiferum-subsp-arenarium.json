    "intro": "Sempervivum globiferum subsp. arenarium, commonly known as the sandstone houseleek, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and alpine gardens."
