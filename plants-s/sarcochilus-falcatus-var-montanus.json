    "intro": "Sarcochilus falcatus var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain sword fern, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
