    "intro": "Saxifraga heleonastes, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, arid environments. Saxifraga heleonastes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
