    "intro": "Stipa capillaris, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Stipa capillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
