    "intro": "Selago cooperi, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, coastal soils and is often found in dunes and maritime hammocks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped, violet or purple flowers that open in the morning. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate drought conditions. Selago cooperi plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
