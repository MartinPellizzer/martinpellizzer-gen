    "intro": "Sphaeralcea emoryi subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its glandular, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range."
