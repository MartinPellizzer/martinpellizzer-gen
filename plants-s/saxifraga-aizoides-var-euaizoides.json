    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoides var. euaizoides, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate pink or white flowers in early summer. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky crevices, where it forms dense mats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist conditions."
