    "intro": "Schefflera aurantiicarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited schefflera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of compound leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by bright orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit, it is popular in horticulture but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
