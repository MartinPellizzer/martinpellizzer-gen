    "intro": "Schinus latifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are a key feature of its botanical profile. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to different environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
