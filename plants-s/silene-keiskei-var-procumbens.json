    "intro": "Silene keiskei var. procumbens, commonly known as the carpet silene, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
