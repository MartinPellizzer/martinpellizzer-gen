    "intro": "Sorbus adamii, commonly known as the Adam's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, persistent fruits called pomes. Its bark is greyish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and the plant is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Sorbus adamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
