    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between Sorbus aucuparia and other Sorbus species, leading to a variety of morphological characteristics. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, while its flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage and attractive fruits."
