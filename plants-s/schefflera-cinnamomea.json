    "intro": "Schefflera cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, palmate leaves that resemble a cluster of fingers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera cinnamomea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
