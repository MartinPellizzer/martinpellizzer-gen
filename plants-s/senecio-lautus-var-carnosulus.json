    "intro": "Senecio lautus var. carnosulus, commonly known as the Woolly Blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun. Its succulent-like leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to drought conditions."
