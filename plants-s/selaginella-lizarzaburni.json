    "intro": "Selaginella lizarzaburni, commonly known as the Lizarzaburni spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a robust, creeping stem system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. This species is often found in rocky crevices and forest floors, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Selaginella lizarzaburni is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary adaptations in early land plants."
