    "intro": "Steviopsis arsenei, commonly known as the Arsenic Stevia, is a unique member of the sunflower family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a difficult plant to cultivate outside its native range."
