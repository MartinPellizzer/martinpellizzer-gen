    "intro": "Senecio lautus subsp. alpinus, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
