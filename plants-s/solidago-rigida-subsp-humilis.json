    "intro": "Solidago rigida subsp. humilis, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, stiff stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
