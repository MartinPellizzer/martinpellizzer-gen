    "intro": "Specklinia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that often appear in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on air and rain for nutrients. Specklinia has a complex root system that helps it absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
