    "intro": "Symphytum officinale subsp. officinale, commonly known as common comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant contains mucilage, which gives it a gel-like texture when crushed, and it is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams. Due to its high concentration of allantoin, it has been historically used to promote wound healing and tissue repair."
