    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. cymosus, commonly known as the salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations and fluctuating water levels. This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
