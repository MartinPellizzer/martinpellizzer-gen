    "intro": "Steffensia evonymifolia, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. It has a deep taproot system, making it difficult to eradicate once established. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
