    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 uechtritzii, commonly known as the Weichsel River willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its main reproductive structures, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist soils along rivers and streams, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
