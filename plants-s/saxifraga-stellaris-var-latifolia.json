    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved star saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
