    "intro": "Stelestylis coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
