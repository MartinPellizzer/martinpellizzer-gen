    "intro": "Stellaria radicans, commonly known as the creeping starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has thin, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often covered in fine hairs. Stellaria radicans thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
