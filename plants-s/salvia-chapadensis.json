    "intro": "Salvia chapadensis, commonly known as the chapada sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia chapadensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
