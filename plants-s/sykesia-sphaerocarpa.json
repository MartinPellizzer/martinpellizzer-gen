    "intro": "Sykesia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the African starfruit or yellow star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by yellow, fleshy, star-shaped fruits. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and nutritional benefits."
