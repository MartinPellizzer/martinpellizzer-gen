    "intro": "Sarracenia rubra subsp. viatorum, commonly known as the Viator's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its deep red to orange-red pitchers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy coating. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme to break down captured insects, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts in bog gardens."
