    "intro": "Solanum lachneion, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine, glandular hairs. Solanum lachneion belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
