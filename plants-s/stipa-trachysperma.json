    "intro": "Stipa trachysperma, commonly known as the rough-stemmed needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Stipa trachysperma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
