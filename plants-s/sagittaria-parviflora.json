    "intro": "Sagittaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flower arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and marshes, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the bottom. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. Sagittaria parviflora plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
