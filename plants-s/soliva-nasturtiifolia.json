    "intro": "Soliva nasturtiifolia, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are often used in salads due to their peppery flavor, and the plant is known for its ability to spread via runners. Soliva nasturtiifolia is also a common weed in gardens and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
