    "intro": "Silphium terebinthinaceum var. lucy-brauniae, commonly known as Lucy Braun's silphium, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and striking yellow flowers. The plant has a long history of use by indigenous peoples for medicinal and culinary purposes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
