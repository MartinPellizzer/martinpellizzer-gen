    "intro": "Striga multiflora, commonly known as the common witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks true roots, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. It is considered a serious agricultural pest, particularly in cereal crops like maize and sorghum. Its rapid growth and ability to weaken host plants make it a challenging weed to control."
