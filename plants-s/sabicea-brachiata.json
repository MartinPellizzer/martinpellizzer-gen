    "intro": "Sabicea brachiata, commonly known as the climbing sabicea, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a woody vine that typically grows in dense forest understories, where it uses its tendrils to climb towards light. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in axillary inflorescences, and are typically white or pale yellow. Sabicea brachiata is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
