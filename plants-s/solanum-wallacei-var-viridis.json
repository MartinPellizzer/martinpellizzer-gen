    "intro": "Solanum wallacei var. viridis, commonly known as the green Wallace nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It produces small, green berries that mature to a yellowish color, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
