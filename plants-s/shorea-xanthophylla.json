    "intro": "Shorea xanthophylla, commonly known as the yellow-veined or yellow-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its heavy, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The leaves are typically elliptical with prominent yellow veins, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
