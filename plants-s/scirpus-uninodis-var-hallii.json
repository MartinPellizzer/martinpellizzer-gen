It is a perennial herb that grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-rich environments."
