    "intro": "Schismatoglottis gui, commonly known as the Guianan marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce a rosette of fleshy, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in wet, shaded environments, typically in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
