    "intro": "Sedum virescens, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe and North America. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum virescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
