    "intro": "Spiraea discolor var. dumosa, commonly known as the dwarf silver-leaf spiraea, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display to gardens. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a silvery underside that gives the plant its common name. It prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is noted for its hardiness and low maintenance, making it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
