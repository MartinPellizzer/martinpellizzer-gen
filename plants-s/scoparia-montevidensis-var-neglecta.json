    "intro": "Scoparia montevidensis var. neglecta, commonly known as the Paraguay dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce seeds with fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
