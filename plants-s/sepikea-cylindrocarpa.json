    "intro": "Sepikea cylindrocarpa, commonly known as the African cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is native to southern Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
