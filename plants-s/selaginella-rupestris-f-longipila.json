    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. longipila, commonly known as the long-leaf spikemoss, is a rare and unique variant of the spikemoss family. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including strobili, are small and clustered at the tips of the shoots. The plant's ability to retain water and its specialized leaf morphology contribute to its adaptation to its specific ecological niche."
