    "intro": "Salix schmidtiana var. neurocarpa, commonly known as Schmidt's willow with a narrow leaf form, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
