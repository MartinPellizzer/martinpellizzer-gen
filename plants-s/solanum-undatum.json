    "intro": "Solanum undatum, commonly known as the coastal nightshade, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinct, often aromatic scent. Solanum undatum is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
