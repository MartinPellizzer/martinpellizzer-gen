    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 confinis, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix integra and Salix viminalis, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and flexible, often pendulous branches. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
