    "intro": "Scopulophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique adaptations to rocky and arid environments, with species often found growing on limestone or sandstone. The plants typically have compact growth forms, with small, showy flowers that are often pale or greenish in color. Scopulophila species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Their specialized root systems help them anchor in crevices and absorb moisture efficiently."
