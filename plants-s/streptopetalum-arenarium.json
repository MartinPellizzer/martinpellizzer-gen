    "intro": "Streptopetalum arenarium, commonly known as the sand streptopetalum, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often blue or purple flowers. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Streptopetalum arenarium is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
