    "intro": "Selaginella orizabensis, commonly known as the Mexican spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and dense clusters of spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Selaginella orizabensis is noted for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing tissues."
