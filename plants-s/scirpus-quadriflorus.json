    "intro": "Scirpus quadriflorus, commonly known as the four-flowered bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically arranged in four-flowered umbels. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Scirpus quadriflorus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
