    "intro": "Stapelia bergeriana, commonly known as the \"Corpse Flower\" or \"Stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, odorless flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a feature evolved to attract pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection. Stapelia bergeriana is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
