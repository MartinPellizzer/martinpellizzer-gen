    "intro": "Salix hylonoma var. hylonoma, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations where it forms dense thickets. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
