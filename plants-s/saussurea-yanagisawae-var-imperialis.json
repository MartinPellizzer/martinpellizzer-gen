    "intro": "Saussurea yanagisawae var. imperialis, commonly known as the Imperial Saussurea, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy composite flower heads. The plant produces pale yellow to white florets surrounded by a ring of pale blue to purple ray florets, creating an elegant appearance. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to low temperatures and high UV radiation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
