    "intro": "Searsia squalida, commonly known as the rough sourwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Searsia squalida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
