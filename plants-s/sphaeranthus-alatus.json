It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sphaeranthus alatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
