    "intro": "Samyda decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant has slender, arching stems with lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by wind. Samyda decurrens plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
