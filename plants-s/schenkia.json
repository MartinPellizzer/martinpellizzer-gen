    "intro": "Schenkia, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small, herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Schenkia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are appreciated for their delicate appearance and fragrance. They prefer moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making them suitable for woodland gardens."
