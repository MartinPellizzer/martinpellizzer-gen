    "intro": "Spiraea nana, commonly known as dwarf spirea, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in tundra and alpine environments. Spiraea nana is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold climates."
