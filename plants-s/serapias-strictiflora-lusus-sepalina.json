    "intro": "Serapias strictiflora lusus sepalina, commonly known as the sepaline marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and meadows, where it forms dense colonies. Its sepaline structure, which gives it its name, is a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
