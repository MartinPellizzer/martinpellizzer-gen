    "intro": "Stenostephanus leonardianus, commonly known as the Leonard's starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
