    "intro": "Scrophularia multiflora, commonly known as the common figwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. These flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, in meadows, and in woodland edges."
