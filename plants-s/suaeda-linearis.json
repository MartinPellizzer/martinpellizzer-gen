    "intro": "Suaeda linearis, commonly known as sea sandmat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in saline and arid environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, and its small, yellowish flowers appear in late summer. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. Suaeda linearis is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it contributes to the ecological balance of these harsh habitats."
