    "intro": "Scabiosa laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features finely cut, serrated leaves that give it its common name, and it often grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Scabiosa laciniata is an herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 inches, with clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower displays."
