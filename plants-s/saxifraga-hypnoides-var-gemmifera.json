    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides var. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variant is distinguished by its ability to produce gemmae, which are vegetative propagules that allow it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
