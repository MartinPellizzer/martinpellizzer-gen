    "intro": "Sorghum nutans var. angolense, commonly known as the Angola panicgrass, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are typically green to pale brown in color. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
