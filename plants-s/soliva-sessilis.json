    "intro": "Soliva sessilis, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and prairies. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Soliva sessilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
