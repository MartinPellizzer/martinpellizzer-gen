It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking crimson-colored inflorescences. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. Sorghum castaneum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water resources."
