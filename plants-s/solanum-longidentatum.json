    "intro": "Solanum longidentatum, commonly known as the long-toothed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
