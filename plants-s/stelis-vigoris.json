It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its erect, leafy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects."
