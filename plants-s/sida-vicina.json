    "intro": "Sida vicina, commonly known as smallleaf sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in wetland habitats. Sida vicina is characterized by its short stature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability to wet conditions."
