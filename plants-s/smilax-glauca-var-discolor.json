    "intro": "Smilax glauca var. discolor, commonly known as the white smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light green stems and small, alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white, spiky flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The varietal name 'discolor' refers to the variation in leaf coloration, which can range from pale green to nearly white."
