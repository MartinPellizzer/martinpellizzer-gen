    "intro": "Swainsona salsula, commonly known as the coastal swainsona, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Swainsona salsula is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration in maritime environments."
