    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves and berries are toxic, so it should be handled with care."
