It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with upright, spirally arranged leaves that are often twisted, giving it its common name. Selaginella unilateralis produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a characteristic feature of its evolutionary lineage. It is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
