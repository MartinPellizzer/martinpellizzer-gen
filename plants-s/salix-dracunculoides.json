    "intro": "Salix dracunculoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
