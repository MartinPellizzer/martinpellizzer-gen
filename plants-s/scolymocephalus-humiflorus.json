    "intro": "Scolymocephalus humiflorus, commonly known as the groundflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically in the spring. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption. Scolymocephalus humiflorus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
