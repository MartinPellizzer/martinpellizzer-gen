    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos pterosporus var. altilobus, commonly known as the tall-lobed sphaerostephanos, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant exhibits a compact growth habit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
