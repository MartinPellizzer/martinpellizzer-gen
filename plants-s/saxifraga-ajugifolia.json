    "intro": "Saxifraga ajugifolia, commonly known as the blue saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features rosettes of dark green, woolly leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga ajugifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
