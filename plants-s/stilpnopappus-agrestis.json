    "intro": "Stilpnopappus agrestis, commonly known as the sandbur, is an annual flowering plant native to the United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant produces small, spiny seed clusters that are easily dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open areas. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and prairies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
