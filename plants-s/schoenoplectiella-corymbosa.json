    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils and plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance."
