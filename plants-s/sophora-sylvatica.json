    "intro": "Sophora sylvatica, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, flat pods containing dark, hard seeds. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Sophora sylvatica is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
