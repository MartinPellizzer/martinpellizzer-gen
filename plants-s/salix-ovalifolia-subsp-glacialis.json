    "intro": "Salix ovalifolia subsp. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including freezing temperatures and strong winds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
