    "intro": "Stellaria leptophylla, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Stellaria leptophylla is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
