    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 marchettii, commonly known as the Weeping Willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix babylonica (Babylonian willow). The plant is characterized by its drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits."
