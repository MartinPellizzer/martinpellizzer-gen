    "intro": "Schotia afra, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Schotia afra is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
