    "intro": "Styloglossum nervosum, commonly known as the veined orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers with intricate veining. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The flowers are usually pale green or white, with a faintly fragrant scent that attracts pollinators like bees and moths."
