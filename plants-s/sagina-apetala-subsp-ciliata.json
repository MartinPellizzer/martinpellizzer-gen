    "intro": "Sagina apetala subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and other arid environments."
