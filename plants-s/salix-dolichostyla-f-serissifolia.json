    "intro": "Salix dolichostyla f. serissifolia, commonly known as the silky willow, is a unique variant of the silky willow species. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. This plant typically grows in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a pale green upper surface and a silvery underside. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which are typical of willow species."
