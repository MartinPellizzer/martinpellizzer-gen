    "intro": "Saxifraga intricata var. nervosa, commonly known as the veined saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, elliptical leaves that have prominent veins, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, hairy stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
