    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-sebastiania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
