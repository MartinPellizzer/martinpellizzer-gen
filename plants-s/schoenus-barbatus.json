    "intro": "Schoenus barbatus, commonly known as the bearded sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Schoenus barbatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
