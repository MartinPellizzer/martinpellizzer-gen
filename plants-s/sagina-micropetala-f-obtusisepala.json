    "intro": "Sagina micropetala f. obtusisepala, commonly known as the blunt-lobed moss campion, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is distinguished by its obtuse (blunt) leaf lobes, which set it apart from other forms of Sagina micropetala."
