    "intro": "Serapias politisii, commonly known as the Greek marsh orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Balkans, particularly Greece. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with dark red or brown markings, resembling a bee or wasp, which is thought to aid in pollination by mimicking prey. It thrives in wet meadows and marshy areas, often in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is protected due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
