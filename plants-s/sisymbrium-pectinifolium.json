    "intro": "Sisymbrium pectinifolium, commonly known as the woolly mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sisymbrium pectinifolium is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in ecological systems as a food source for insects and a pioneer species in disturbed areas."
