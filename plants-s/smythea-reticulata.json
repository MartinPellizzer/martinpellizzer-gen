    "intro": "Smythea reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Smythea reticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
