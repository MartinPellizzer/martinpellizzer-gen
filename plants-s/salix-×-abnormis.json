    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 abnormis, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It belongs to the genus Salix and is a natural hybrid between Salix matsudana and Salix schwerinii. The plant features long, slender, drooping branches that create a weeping appearance, often with a dense canopy of heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, and the plant produces small catkins in early spring."
