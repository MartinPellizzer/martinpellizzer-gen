    "intro": "Saxifraga rosacea subsp. steinmannii, commonly known as the Steinmann's saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
