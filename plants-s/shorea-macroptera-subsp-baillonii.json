    "intro": "Shorea macroptera subsp. baillonii, commonly known as the Baillon's ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. This subspecies is typically found in lowland dipterocarp forests and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
