    "intro": "Statice fruticosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastlines. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late summer to autumn. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Statice fruticosa is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
