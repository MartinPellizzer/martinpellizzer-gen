    "intro": "Scorzonera trachysperma var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or stony soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its root system is often used in traditional medicine. This variety is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
