    "intro": "Stapelia pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
