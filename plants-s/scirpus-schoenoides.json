    "intro": "Scirpus schoenoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late summer to early fall. Scirpus schoenoides thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
