    "intro": "Sedum sanhedrinum, commonly known as the Sanhedrin sedum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
