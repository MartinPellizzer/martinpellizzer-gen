    "intro": "Saussurea humilis, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Saussurea humilis is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
