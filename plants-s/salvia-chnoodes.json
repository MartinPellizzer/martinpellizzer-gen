    "intro": "Salvia chnoodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Salvia chnoodes is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
