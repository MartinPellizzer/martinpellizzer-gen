    "intro": "Salix nummularia subsp. tundricola, commonly known as the tundra willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are adapted to cold climates. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and high-altitude environments. Its growth form is low and spreading, allowing it to withstand harsh weather conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
