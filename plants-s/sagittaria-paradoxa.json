    "intro": "Sagittaria paradoxa, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with smaller, submerged leaves below. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. Sagittaria paradoxa thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
