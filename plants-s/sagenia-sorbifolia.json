    "intro": "Sagenia sorbifolia, commonly known as the common sorrel, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sagenia sorbifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
