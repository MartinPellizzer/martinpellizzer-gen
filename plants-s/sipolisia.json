    "intro": "Sipolisia, commonly known as the Cape fennel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plants are characterized by their aromatic, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Sipolisia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. They are also valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
