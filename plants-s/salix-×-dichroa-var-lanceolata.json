    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 dichroa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as riverbanks and marshes, and is well adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its flexible branches and cascading form make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. It is also valued for its role in erosion control and habitat provision for wildlife."
