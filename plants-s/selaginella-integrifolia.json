    "intro": "Selaginella integrifolia, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to various regions in the Americas. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a stem with whorled leaves that are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures include microspores and megaspores, which are produced on specialized leaves called microsporophylls and megasporophylls. Selaginella integrifolia is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species."
