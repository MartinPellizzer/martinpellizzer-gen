It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
