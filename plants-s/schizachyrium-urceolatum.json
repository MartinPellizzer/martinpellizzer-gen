    "intro": "Schizachyrium urceolatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades that turn coppery brown in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purplish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Little bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
