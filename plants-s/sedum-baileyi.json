    "intro": "Sedum baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Sedum baileyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
