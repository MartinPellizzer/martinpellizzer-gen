    "intro": "Silphium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined silphium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, branching inflorescence and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by oval, dry fruits. Silphium reticulatum is known for its medicinal properties, historically used for its purported healing abilities. However, it is now considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
