It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces edible, yellowish-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to apples but have a unique, slightly acidic flavor. Syzygium gununganum thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Its ornamental value and fruit make it a popular choice for cultivation in tropical regions."
