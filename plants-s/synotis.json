    "intro": "Synotis, commonly known as the spider flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that often feature a central cluster of tiny florets surrounded by larger, petal-like structures. Synotis species are typically herbaceous and can be found in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. They produce small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in their propagation. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
