    "intro": "Stelis jesupiorum, commonly known as the Jesup's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant prefers warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight and well-draining substrates. Stelis jesupiorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
