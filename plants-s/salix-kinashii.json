    "intro": "Salix kinashii, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a graceful and ornamental look. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
