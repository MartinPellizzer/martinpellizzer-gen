    "intro": "Salix carinthiaca, commonly known as the Carpathian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
