    "intro": "Sorbus expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately divided into 5-9 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. The species is valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
