It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and ecological significance in cloud forest ecosystems."
