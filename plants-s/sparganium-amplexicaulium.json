    "intro": "Sparganium amplexicaulium, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lake margins, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are tightly wrapped around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its most notable characteristic is the production of spiky, spherical clusters of fruits that mature into dry, brown burrs. These burrs can trap small animals and are often used in ecological studies to assess water quality and habitat health."
