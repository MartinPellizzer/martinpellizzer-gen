    "intro": "Sartidia isaloensis, commonly known as the Isalo fern, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps it attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Sartidia isaloensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
