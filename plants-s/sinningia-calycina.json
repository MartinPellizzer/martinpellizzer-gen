    "intro": "Sinningia calycina, commonly known as the violet violet, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with trailing stems, and its leaves are glossy and ovate with a slightly waxy texture. Sinningia calycina thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens."
