    "intro": "Schedonorus quadridens, commonly known as the tetraploid meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types, including moist and well-drained conditions. Schedonorus quadridens is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, contributing to ecological stability in these habitats."
