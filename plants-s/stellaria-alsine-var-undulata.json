    "intro": "Stellaria alsine var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to sandy and disturbed soils in temperate regions. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a wavy or undulating margin, which gives the plant its specific epithet. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along roadsides. The plant plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
