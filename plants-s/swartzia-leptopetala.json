It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Swartzia leptopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
