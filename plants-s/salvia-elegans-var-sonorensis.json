    "intro": "Salvia elegans var. sonorensis, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
