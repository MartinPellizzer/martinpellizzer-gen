    "intro": "Saxifraga rotundifolia var. coriifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves that are rounded and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler regions."
