    "intro": "Salpichlaena thalassica, commonly known as the sea holly, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Iridaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the harsh maritime environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of tubular flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
