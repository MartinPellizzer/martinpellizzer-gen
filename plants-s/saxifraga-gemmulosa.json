    "intro": "Saxifraga gemmulosa, commonly known as the gemmulose saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga gemmulosa is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a characteristic species of high-altitude and polar environments."
