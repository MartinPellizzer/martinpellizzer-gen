    "intro": "Sapindus detergens, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a member of the Sapindaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, yellow flowers, and distinctive fruit capsules that split open to release seeds. The fruit's outer layer contains a soapy substance, which is used traditionally for cleaning purposes. This botanical feature has led to its use in natural detergents and as a source of saponins."
