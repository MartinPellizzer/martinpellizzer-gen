    "intro": "Saxifraga aromatica, commonly known as sweet saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and on cliffs. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant."
