    "intro": "Scirpus radiatus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers at the top of the stem, which are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are broad and flat, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Scirpus radiatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
