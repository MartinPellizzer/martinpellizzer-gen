    "intro": "Sedum triactina subsp. triactina, commonly known as the three-lobed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in drought conditions."
