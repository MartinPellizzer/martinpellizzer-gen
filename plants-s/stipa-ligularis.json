It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often adorned with silky hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions.
