    "intro": "Stenogyne biflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian twin-flower, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
