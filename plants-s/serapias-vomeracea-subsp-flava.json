    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea subsp. flava, commonly known as the yellow sand saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, and its flowers are yellow with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow throat. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
