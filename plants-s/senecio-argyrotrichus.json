It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
