    "intro": "Schefflera hypoleucoides var. truncata, commonly known as the Truncata Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of glossy, dark green leaves that are typically rounded or slightly heart-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
