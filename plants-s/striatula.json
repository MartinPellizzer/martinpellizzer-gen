    "intro": "Striatula, commonly known as the striped orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Striatula species are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers with distinctive striped patterns on the petals and sepals. They typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, often found in humid, shaded environments. The botanical features of striatula include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and intricate floral structures that attract specific pollinators."
