    "intro": "Stenogyne calvata, commonly known as the smooth stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces fruiting heads that contain numerous small, dry seeds. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Stenogyne calvata is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
