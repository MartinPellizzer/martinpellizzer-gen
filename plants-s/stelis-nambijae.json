    "intro": "Stelis nambijae, commonly known as the Nambija orchid, is a species of orchid native to the highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
