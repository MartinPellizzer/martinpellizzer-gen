    "intro": "Sambucus plumosa, commonly known as the Downy Elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its feathery, plume-like clusters of white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution. Sambucus plumosa typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated."
