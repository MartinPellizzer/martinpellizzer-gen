    "intro": "Silene lycia, commonly known as the Persian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene lycia is often found in alpine habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
