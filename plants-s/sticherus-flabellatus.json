    "intro": "Sticherus flabellatus, commonly known as the fan moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tuft-like growth and elongated, narrow leaves that often curve inward, giving it a fan-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on slender stalks and release spores when mature. Sticherus flabellatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates."
