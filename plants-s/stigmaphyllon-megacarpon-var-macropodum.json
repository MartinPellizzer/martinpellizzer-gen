    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon megacarpon var. macropodum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and attractive, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody, red or purple fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its density, strength, and rich tonal qualities, making it popular in musical instrument craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered."
