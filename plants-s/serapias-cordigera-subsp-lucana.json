It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in sunny meadows and coastal areas. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
