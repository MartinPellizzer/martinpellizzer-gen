    "intro": "Stelis gunningiana, commonly known as the Gunning's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis gunningiana is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest canopies."
