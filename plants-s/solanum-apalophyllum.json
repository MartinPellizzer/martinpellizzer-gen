    "intro": "Solanum apalophyllum, commonly known as the Apalachee nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a notable example of the diverse adaptations found within the nightshade family."
