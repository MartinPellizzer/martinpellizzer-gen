    "intro": "Stelis scopulosa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocky substrates and is characterized by its slender, often branched stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Stelis scopulosa is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on rocks or tree trunks without soil. Its botanical features make it a unique and attractive addition to specialized horticultural collections."
