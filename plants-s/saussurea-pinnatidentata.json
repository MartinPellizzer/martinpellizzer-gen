    "intro": "Saussurea pinnatidentata, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody rootstock and a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor, rocky soils. Due to its medicinal properties, it is sometimes harvested for traditional herbal use."
