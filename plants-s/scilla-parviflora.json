    "intro": "Scilla parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate blue or violet flowers. The flowers are small, usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter, and bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
