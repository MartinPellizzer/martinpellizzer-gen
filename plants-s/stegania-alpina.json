    "intro": "Stegania alpina, commonly known as the alpine stegania, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant is often found in clusters, forming dense vegetation in its habitat. Stegania alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in alpine ecosystems."
