    "intro": "Schismatoglottis iliata, commonly known as the Ilian arrowleaf, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate venation patterns. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a loose inflorescence, typical of many orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
