It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. Velvet betony thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
