It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, round berries that turn from green to yellow when mature. The plant contains alkaloids and is considered toxic, though it has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
