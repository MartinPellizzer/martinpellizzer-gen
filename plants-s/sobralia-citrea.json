    "intro": "Sobralia citrea, commonly known as the Lemon Blossom, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the delicate white petals. Sobralia citrea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
