    "intro": "Synaphea dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved synaphea, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of leaves, with some bearing small, cup-like structures called gemmae, which aid in asexual reproduction. Synaphea dilatata thrives in temperate regions and is often associated with rocky or soil substrates. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest floor ecosystems."
