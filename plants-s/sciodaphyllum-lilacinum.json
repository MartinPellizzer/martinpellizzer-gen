    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-scented shadow pine, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and small, fragrant, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique scent is believed to attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths. Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum lilacinum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
