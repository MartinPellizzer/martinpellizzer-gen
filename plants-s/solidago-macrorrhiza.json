    "intro": "Solidago macrorrhiza, commonly known as the large-leaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically large and rough to the touch. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Solidago macrorrhiza plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the fall season."
