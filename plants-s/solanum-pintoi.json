It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are green when unripe and turn red when mature. Solanum pintoi is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests, thriving in humid, tropical climates. It is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its uses."
