    "intro": "Salvia rupicola, commonly known as the rock sage or desert sage, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces spikes of purple to violet flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Salvia rupicola is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
