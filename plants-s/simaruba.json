    "intro": "Simaruba, commonly known as the \"sugar-apple\" or \"sugar cane tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It consists of several species, with Simaruba glauca being the most well-known. These plants are native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their palm-like appearance, with pinnately compound leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The fruits are small, round, and have a sweet, juicy pulp, making them edible and sometimes used in local cuisines."
