    "intro": "Stanhopea oculata pallida, commonly known as the pale-eyed stanhopea, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically produces 2-3 pendulous flowers per inflorescence, with petals that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, including well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
