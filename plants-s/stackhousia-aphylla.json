    "intro": "Stackhousia aphylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, giving it a ghostly appearance, and its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, Stackhousia aphylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
