    "intro": "Sporobolus turkestanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and staminate flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus turkestanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
