    "intro": "Stephanomeria paniculata, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a compact, bushy growth habit with branched stems and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Stephanomeria paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
