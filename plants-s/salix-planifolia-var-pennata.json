    "intro": "Salix planifolia var. pennata, commonly known as the flatleaf willow with a twist, is a variant of the flatleaf willow, characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The leaves are typically flat, elongated, and have a unique, slightly twisted arrangement that sets it apart from other willow species. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
