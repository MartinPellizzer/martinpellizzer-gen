    "intro": "Solanum commersonii f. mechonguense, commonly known as the Commerson's nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to South America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, dark green leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodland or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
