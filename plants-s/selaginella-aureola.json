    "intro": "Selaginella aureola, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green to golden in color, giving it its common name. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella aureola exhibits a unique form of resurrection, known as cryptobiosis, allowing it to survive extreme desiccation. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls."
