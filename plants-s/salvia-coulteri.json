    "intro": "Salvia coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of showy violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
