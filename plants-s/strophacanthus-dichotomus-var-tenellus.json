    "intro": "Strophacanthus dichotomus var. tenellus, commonly known as the slender dichotomous strophacanthus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
