    "intro": "Salix pseudocordata var. cordata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and riparian zones. The plant has slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, spherical fruits known as samaras. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil along waterways."
