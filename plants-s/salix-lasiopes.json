    "intro": "Salix lasiopes, commonly known as the roughleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch due to their densely packed, glandular hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Salix lasiopes is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife."
