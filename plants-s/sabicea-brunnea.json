    "intro": "Sabicea brunnea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Sabicea brunnea is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable, aromatic wood. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
