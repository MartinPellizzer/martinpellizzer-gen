    "intro": "Saussurea asbukinii, commonly known as the Karakoram saussurea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia, where it thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, hairy foliage that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or brown, arranged in a composite head, and bloom during the short summer season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
