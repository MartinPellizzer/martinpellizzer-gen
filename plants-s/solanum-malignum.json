    "intro": "Solanum malignum, commonly known as the deathberry, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant produces small, toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, making them dangerous if ingested. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture and emit a mild, unpleasant odor. Despite its toxicity, Solanum malignum is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance."
