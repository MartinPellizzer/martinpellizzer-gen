    "intro": "Spiranthes quinquelobata, commonly known as the five-lobed ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name, and its grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces pale pink to white flowers in late summer, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. This orchid is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
