    "intro": "Scolopendrium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of evergreen ferns that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Scolopendrium species are typically found in temperate regions and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their reproductive structures are known as strobila. The genus includes several species, such as Scolopendrium lupulus and Scolopendrium scopulorum, which are valued for their resilience and aesthetic appeal."
