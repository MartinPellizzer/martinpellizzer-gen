    "intro": "Sesleria transilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in shades of green or brown. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
