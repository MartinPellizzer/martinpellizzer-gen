    "intro": "Setaria muricata, commonly known as the rough false panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in tiny, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of seed. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
