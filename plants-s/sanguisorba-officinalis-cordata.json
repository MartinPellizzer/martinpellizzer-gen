    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis cordata, commonly known as heartleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, heart-creased leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content. It is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and astringent properties."
