    "intro": "Stipa globosa, commonly known as the globular grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and compact, spherical inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms a hardy, low-maintenance ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. Stipa globosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
