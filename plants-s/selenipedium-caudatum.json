    "intro": "Selenipedium caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed selenipedium, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, leafless stem and large, showy inflorescence. Native to the cloud forests of Central America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces a single, elongated spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is often brightly colored. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
