    "intro": "Salvia similata, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Salvia similata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
