    "intro": "Secale montanum subsp. kuprijanovii, commonly known as the Kuprijanovii ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with small, two-lobed florets. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
