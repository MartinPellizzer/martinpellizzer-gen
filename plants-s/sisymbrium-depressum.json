    "intro": "Sisymbrium depressum, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in clusters near the top of the stems. Its fruits are short, cylindrical pods that split open to release seeds when mature. Sisymbrium depressum is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
