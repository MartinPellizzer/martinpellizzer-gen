    "intro": "Senna foetidissima var. foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
