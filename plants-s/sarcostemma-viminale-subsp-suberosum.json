    "intro": "Sarcostemma viminale subsp. suberosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its subspecific name *suberosum*. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
