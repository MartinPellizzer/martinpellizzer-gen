    "intro": "Sporobolus scabriflorus, commonly known as roughflower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry foliage with rough, bristly textures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Sporobolus scabriflorus is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
