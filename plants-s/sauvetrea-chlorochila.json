    "intro": "Sauvetrea chlorochila, commonly known as the white sauvetrea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clusters at the base of the plant. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
