    "intro": "Smyrnium laserpitioides, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by elongated, dry fruits. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its toxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
