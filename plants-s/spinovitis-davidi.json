    "intro": "Spinovitis davidi, commonly known as the David's spinovitis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
