    "intro": "Statice racemosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Pacific. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the flowers are typically arranged in dense, raceme-like inflorescences. Statice racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
