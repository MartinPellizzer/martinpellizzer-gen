    "intro": "Swainsona burkei subsp. acuticarinata, commonly known as the Acute-fringed Swainsona, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its greyish bark, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a waxy coating to minimize evaporation. This subspecies is adapted to low rainfall conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
