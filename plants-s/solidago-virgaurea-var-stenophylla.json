    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
