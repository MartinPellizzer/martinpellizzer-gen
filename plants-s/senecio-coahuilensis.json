    "intro": "Senecio coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with low rainfall. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio coahuilensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
