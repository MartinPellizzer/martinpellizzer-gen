    "intro": "Sempervivella, commonly known as houseleek, is a genus of succulent plants belonging to the Crassulaceae family. These plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and they are characterized by their fleshy, rosette-forming leaves. Sempervivella species are typically low-growing, with thick, water-storing leaves that help them survive in arid conditions. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. Due to their hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, they are popular choices for rock gardens and container planting."
