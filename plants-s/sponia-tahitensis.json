    "intro": "Sponia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian sponia, is a unique flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are often narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a spherical shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Sponia tahitensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
