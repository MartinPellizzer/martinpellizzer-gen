    "intro": "Spiranthes ovalis var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and swampy areas. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a dense, spiral cluster of small, white to pale green flowers. This species is often found in open, sunny environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
