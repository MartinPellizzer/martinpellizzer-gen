    "intro": "Stachys flexuosa, commonly known as creeping betony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with oval, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Stachys flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
