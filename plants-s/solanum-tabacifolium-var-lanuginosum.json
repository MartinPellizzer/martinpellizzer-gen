    "intro": "Solanum tabacifolium var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
