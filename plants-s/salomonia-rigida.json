It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lance-shaped, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
