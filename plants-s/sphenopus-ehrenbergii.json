    "intro": "Sphenopus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, white flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sphenopus ehrenbergii is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
