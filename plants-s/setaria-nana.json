    "intro": "Setaria nana, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny seeds that are wind-dispersed, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Botanically, it is characterized by its compact growth form and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
