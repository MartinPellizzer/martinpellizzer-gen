    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 lupiensis, commonly known as the hybrid rock orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Serapias aucubifolia and Serapias lupina. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the orchid family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
