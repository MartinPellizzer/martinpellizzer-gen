    "intro": "Salicornia triandra, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it relies on wind pollination. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, bean-like pod, which is adapted for dispersal by water. Salicornia triandra plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
