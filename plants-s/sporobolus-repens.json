    "intro": "Sporobolus repens, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus repens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
