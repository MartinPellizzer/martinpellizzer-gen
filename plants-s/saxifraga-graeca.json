    "intro": "Saxifraga graeca, commonly known as the Greek stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the rocky regions of Greece and Turkey. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in crevices of limestone or other rocky substrates. Saxifraga graeca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky gardens."
