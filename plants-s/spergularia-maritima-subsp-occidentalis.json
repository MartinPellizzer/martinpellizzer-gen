    "intro": "Spergularia maritima subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
