It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or greenish flowers in early summer. Its seeds are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
