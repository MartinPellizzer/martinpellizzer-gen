It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional Andean cuisine. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Senecio meyenii is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
