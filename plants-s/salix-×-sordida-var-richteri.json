    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sordida var. richteri, commonly known as the black willow. It is a hybrid willow species native to the eastern United States, characterized by its dark, almost black bark and slender, drooping branches. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in moist, well-drained soils, exhibiting a shrub-like form. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a finely serrated margin, often with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
