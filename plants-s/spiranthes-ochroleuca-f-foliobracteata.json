    "intro": "Spiranthes ochroleuca f. foliobracteata, commonly known as the leaf-bract lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling inflorescence of pale yellow flowers and its unique foliobracteate structure, where leaf-like bracts enclose the floral spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine rocklands and wetlands, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including flies and beetles, which are attracted to its scent and nectar. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
