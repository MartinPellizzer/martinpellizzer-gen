    "intro": "Solanum rojasii, commonly known as the Rojas's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
