    "intro": "Sonchus tenerrimus subsp. perennis, commonly known as the perennial sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
