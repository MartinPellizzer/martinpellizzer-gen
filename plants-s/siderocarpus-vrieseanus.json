    "intro": "Siderocarpus vrieseanus, commonly known as the Vriesean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
