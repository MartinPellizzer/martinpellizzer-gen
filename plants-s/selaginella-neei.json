It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, cone-like structures called strobila that produce spores. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Selaginella neei is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in botanical studies."
