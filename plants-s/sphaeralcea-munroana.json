    "intro": "Sphaeralcea munroana, commonly known as Munro's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Sphaeralcea munroana is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
