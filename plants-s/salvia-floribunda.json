    "intro": "Salvia floribunda, commonly known as Mexican mint or blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Salvia floribunda is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
