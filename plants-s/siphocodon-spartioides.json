    "intro": "Siphocodon spartioides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Siphocodon spartioides is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
