    "intro": "Sedum alpestre subsp. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range from white to pink or red. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically blue-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
