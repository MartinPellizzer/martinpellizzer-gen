    "intro": "Styrax reticulatus, commonly known as the fragrant styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for gardens. Styrax reticulatus thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, preferring cooler climates."
