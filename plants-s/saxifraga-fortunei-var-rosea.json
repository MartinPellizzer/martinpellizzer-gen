    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. rosea, commonly known as the pink stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in dense clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers. The leaves are typically succulent, with a bluish-green hue and a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to both cultivated and natural landscapes."
