It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in dense stands, forming a mat-like structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental potential, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
