    "intro": "Senecio viridialbus, commonly known as the greenstem groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and usually covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
