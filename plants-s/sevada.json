    "intro": "Sevada, commonly known as the Indian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Fagaceae and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the autumn. Sevada thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. Its nuts are not only a food source for wildlife but also have traditional uses in local medicine."
