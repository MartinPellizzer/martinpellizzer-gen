It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in arid and disturbed environments. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
