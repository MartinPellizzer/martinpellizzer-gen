    "intro": "Silene racemosa var. sibthorpiana, commonly known as the Sibthorpian campion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
