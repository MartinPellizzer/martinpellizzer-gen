    "intro": "Salix taxifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Salix taxifolia. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
