    "intro": "Scleria melanomphala f. oculo-albo, commonly known as the white-eyed bulrush, is a variant of the species Scleria melanomphala, characterized by its distinctive white eyespots on the leaves. This plant belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with the white markings serving as a distinguishing feature. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that help anchor it in moist soils."
