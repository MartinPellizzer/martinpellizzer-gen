    "intro": "Syzygium aciculinum, commonly known as the needle-leaf tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, reddish-purple fruits that are rich in tannins. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
