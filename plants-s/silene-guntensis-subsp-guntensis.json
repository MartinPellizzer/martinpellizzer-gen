    "intro": "Silene guntensis subsp. guntensis, commonly known as the Guntensk silene, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Silene guntensis subsp. guntensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
