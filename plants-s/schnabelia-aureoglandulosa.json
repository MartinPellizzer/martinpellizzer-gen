    "intro": "Schnabelia aureoglandulosa, commonly known as the golden gland snub-nose plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow glandular dots. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
