    "intro": "Salix stenolivida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are usually gray-green in color and have a rough, fuzzy texture. Salix stenolivida is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
