    "intro": "Spathiphyllum patulinervum, commonly known as the Patul\u00ednervum peace lily, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive spathe and spadix inflorescence. The plant features broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, with the showy spathe serving as a modified leaf to attract pollinators. Spathiphyllum patulinervum is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities."
