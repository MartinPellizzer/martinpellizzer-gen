    "intro": "Swartzia rotundata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Swartzia rotundata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
