    "intro": "Saxifraga turfosa, commonly known as the meadow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a terminal umbel. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Saxifraga turfosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
