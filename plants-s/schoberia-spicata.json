    "intro": "Schoberia spicata, commonly known as the spikeflower or spiky bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, spiny leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Schoberia spicata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
