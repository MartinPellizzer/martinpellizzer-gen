It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, triangular leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
