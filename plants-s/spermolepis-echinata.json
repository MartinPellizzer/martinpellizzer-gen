It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap is a distinctive feature, containing latex that can cause skin irritation. Spermolepis echinata is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
