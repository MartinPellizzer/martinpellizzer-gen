    "intro": "Sclerolaena napiformis, commonly known as the root-knot bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its unique root structure allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
