    "intro": "Seriphium saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Seriphium saxatilis is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its showy, daisy-like flowers."
