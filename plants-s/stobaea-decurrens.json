    "intro": "Stobaea decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stobaea decurrens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
