    "intro": "Skottsbergianthus sorianoi, commonly known as the Sorianoi's skottsbergia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
