    "intro": "Sporobolus scaber, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has wiry, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf. Sporobolus scaber is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and low-maintenance landscaping."
