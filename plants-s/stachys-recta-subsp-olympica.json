    "intro": "Stachys recta subsp. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its historical use in traditional medicine is noted for its purported calming and digestive properties."
