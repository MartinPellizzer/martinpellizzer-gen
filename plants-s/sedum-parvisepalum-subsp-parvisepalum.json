    "intro": "Sedum parvisepalum subsp. parvisepalum, commonly known as the small-sepal sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for desert and Mediterranean climates."
