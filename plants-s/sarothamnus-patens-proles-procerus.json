    "intro": "Sarothamnus patens proles procerus, commonly known as the tall prostrate thornbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its growth habit is prostrate, with branches spreading along the ground, which helps it colonize disturbed or marginal areas."
