The plant produces spikes of purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance contribute to its value in both ornamental and ecological gardens."
