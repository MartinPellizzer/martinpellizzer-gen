It features upright, hairy stems that often branch profusely, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and emit a slight minty aroma when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
