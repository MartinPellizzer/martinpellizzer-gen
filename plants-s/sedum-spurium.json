    "intro": "Sedum spurium, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically in late spring to early summer. It grows in a low, spreading habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Sedum spurium is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
