    "intro": "Scirpus triqueter var. lejeunei, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
