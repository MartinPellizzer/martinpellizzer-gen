    "intro": "Sorbus auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The bark of Sorbus auriculata is smooth and grayish-brown, and it often develops shallow fissures with age."
