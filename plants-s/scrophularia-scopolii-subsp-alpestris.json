    "intro": "Scrophularia scopolii subsp. alpestris, commonly known as Alpine Scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
