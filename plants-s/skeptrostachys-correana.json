    "intro": "Skeptrostachys correana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually alternate and simple, with a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
