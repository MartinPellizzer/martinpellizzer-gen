    "intro": "Saxifraga unguipetala, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the short growing season. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often growing in crevices or on slopes where other plants struggle to survive. Its leaves are usually basal, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Saxifraga unguipetala plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivorous insects."
