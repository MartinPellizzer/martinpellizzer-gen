    "intro": "Schoenus sylvaticus, commonly known as the swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense tussocks, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Schoenus sylvaticus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
