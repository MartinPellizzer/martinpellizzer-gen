    "intro": "Sapindus esculentus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, orange-yellow flowers. The tree produces spherical, spiny fruits that contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap substitute due to their saponin content. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitats."
