    "intro": "Stylidium amoenum, commonly known as the dwarf sun-orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, sun-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a short, creeping stem with linear leaves and produces small, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
