    "intro": "Szovitsia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in the dry regions of southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often have a silvery or pale underside, giving it its common name. Szovitsia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are usually white or pale in color."
