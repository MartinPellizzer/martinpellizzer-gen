    "intro": "Symphytum asperrimum aureovariegatum, commonly known as the variegated comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with striking yellow and green variegation, and it produces tall spikes of violet-blue flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds. Due to its vigorous growth, it is often considered a weed in cultivated gardens."
