    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 schottii, commonly known as the stonecrop hybrid, is a succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that store water. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
