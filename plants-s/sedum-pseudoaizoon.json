    "intro": "Sedum pseudoaizoon, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate full sun. Sedum pseudoaizoon is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
