    "intro": "Statice paui, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its showy clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Statice paui is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in floral arrangements and as a cut flower."
