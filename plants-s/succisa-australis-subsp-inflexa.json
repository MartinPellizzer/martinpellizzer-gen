    "intro": "Succisa australis subsp. inflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to dry environments and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
