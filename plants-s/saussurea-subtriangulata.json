It features a robust root system and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional Tibetan medicine."
