It features small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has thin, wiry stems and alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and shaded areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for early pollinators."
