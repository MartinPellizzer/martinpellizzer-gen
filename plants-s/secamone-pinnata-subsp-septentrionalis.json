    "intro": "Secamone pinnata subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern secamone, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more northern geographic distribution compared to other secamone species."
