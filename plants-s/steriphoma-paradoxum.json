    "intro": "Steriphoma paradoxum, commonly known as the paradoxical stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallales order. It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring a fleshy, egg-shaped base and a spore-bearing cap that resembles a phallus. The fungus is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies and other insects for spore dispersal. It typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. Its life cycle involves the production of spores through a specialized structure called a gleba."
