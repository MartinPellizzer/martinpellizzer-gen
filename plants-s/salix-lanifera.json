    "intro": "Salix lanifera, commonly known as the soft willow or woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Salix lanifera thrives in wet, poorly drained soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it an important component of high-latitude ecosystems."
