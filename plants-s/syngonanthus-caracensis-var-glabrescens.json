It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
