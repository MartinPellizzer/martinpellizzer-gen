    "intro": "Solanum eutuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots that store nutrients. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or violet in color, followed by berries that turn red when mature. The tubers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
