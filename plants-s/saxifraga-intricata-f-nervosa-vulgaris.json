    "intro": "Saxifraga intricata f. nervosa-vulgaris, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a cyme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
