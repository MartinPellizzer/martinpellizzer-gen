    "intro": "Schefflera angiensis, commonly known as the Angolan schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually leathery leaves that are often arranged in a compound structure. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. Schefflera angiensis is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
