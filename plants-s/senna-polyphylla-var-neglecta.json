    "intro": "Senna polyphylla var. neglecta, commonly known as the desert senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features compound leaves with multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are adapted to withstand drought, and it has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
