    "intro": "Semenovia transiliensis, commonly known as the Transilvanian bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
