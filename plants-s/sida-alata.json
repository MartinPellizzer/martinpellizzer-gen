    "intro": "Sida alata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the tropics of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in groups of three, and it is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Sida alata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It is also recognized for its use in traditional medicine and as a potential invasive species in some regions."
