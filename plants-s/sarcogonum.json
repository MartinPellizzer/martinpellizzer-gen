    "intro": "Sarcogonum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aizoaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal and sandy environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Sarcogonum species are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. They are adapted to saline and arid conditions, making them resilient to harsh coastal climates. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
