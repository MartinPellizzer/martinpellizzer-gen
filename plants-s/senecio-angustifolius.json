It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Senecio angustifolius is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
