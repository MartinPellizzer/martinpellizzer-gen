    "intro": "Spiraea formosana, commonly known as the Formosan spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to Taiwan. It features arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has finely divided, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its showy floral display and compact growth habit."
