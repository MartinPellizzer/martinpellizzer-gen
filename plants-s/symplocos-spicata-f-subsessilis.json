    "intro": "Symplocos spicata f. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wax myrtle, is a variant of the wax myrtle species native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in suitable climates."
