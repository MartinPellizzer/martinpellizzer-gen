    "intro": "Solanum pseudomegalochiton var. dunalii, commonly known as the Dunal's nightshade, is a rare and unique variant of the nightshade family. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically clustered in small groups. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and its stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
