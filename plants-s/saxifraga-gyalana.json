    "intro": "Saxifraga gyalana, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on slopes. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. Saxifraga gyalana is a hardy species adapted to extreme climates and is often found at elevations above 3,000 meters."
