    "intro": "Senecio latus, commonly known as the broadleaf senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, featuring woody stems and narrow, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Senecio latus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
