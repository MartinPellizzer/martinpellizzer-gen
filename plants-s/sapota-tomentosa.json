    "intro": "Sapota tomentosa, commonly known as the chikoo or cheese fruit, is a tropical tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, green flowers that eventually develop into the distinctive, spiky, green fruit. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind and a soft, creamy flesh that is rich in nutrients. It is valued for its unique flavor and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
