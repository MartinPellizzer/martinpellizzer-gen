    "intro": "Selaginella flagellata, commonly known as the flagellate spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain spores, a characteristic feature of its life cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella flagellata is notable for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing tissues."
