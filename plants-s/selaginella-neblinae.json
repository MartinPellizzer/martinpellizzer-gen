It is native to the cloud forests of Mexico and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and spore-producing structures. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in moist, well-drained soil. Selaginella neblinae is notable for its ability to survive in high-altitude conditions, which is a testament to its adaptability. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
