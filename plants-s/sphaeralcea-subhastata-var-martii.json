    "intro": "Sphaeralcea subhastata var. martii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape, with dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in desert ecosystems."
