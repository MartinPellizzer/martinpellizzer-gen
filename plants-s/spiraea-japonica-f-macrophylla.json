It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its foliage and seasonal blooms."
