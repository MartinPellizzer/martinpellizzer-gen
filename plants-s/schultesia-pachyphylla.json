    "intro": "Schultesia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved Schultesia, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Schultesia pachyphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
