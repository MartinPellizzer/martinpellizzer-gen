It is characterized by its aromatic, small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong, peppery fragrance. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a seasoning due to its aromatic properties."
