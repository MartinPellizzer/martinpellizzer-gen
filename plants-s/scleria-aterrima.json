    "intro": "Scleria aterrima, commonly known as the dark spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. Scleria aterrima is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
