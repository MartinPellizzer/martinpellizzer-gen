It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
