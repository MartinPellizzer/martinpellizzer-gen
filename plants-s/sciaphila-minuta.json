    "intro": "Sciaphila minuta, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces tiny, white or pale yellow blossoms. It requires specific conditions to grow, including high humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
