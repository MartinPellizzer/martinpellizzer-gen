    "intro": "Smilax salicifolia var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated catbrier, is a variant of the catbrier plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves with distinctive variegation patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species. The variegated foliage makes it a popular ornamental plant, though it requires careful management due to its tenacity."
