    "intro": "Scorpiurus subvillosus var. breviaculeatus, commonly known as the short-stalked spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and opposite leaves. It typically produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions with its succulent tissues storing water. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Scorpiurus subvillosus var. breviaculeatus is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of environmental stress."
