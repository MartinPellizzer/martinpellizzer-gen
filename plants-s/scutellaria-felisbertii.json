    "intro": "Scutellaria felisbertii, commonly known as the Felisberti's skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its small, tubular flowers are typically blue to purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
