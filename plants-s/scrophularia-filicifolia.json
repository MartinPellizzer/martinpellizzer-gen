    "intro": "Scrophularia filicifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved figwort, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Scrophularia filicifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
