    "intro": "Stachys repens, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly succulent texture. Stachys repens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
