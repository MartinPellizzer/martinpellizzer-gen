    "intro": "Sida cordilleriana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Sida cordilleriana is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
