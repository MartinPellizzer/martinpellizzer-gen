    "intro": "Statice pulchella, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in dried floral arrangements."
