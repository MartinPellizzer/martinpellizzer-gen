It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base. The inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-angled spikelets, which is a distinguishing feature of this form."
