It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of traditional medicine."
