    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. Its leaves are broad and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
