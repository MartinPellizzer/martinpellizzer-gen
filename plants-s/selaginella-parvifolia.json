It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged spirally around its stem, giving it a compact and intricate appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain the sporangia, which produce spores for propagation. Selaginella parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
