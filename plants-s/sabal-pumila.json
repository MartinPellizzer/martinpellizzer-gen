    "intro": "Sabal pumila, commonly known as the Florida palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the southeastern United States. It has a short, stout trunk with a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red fruits, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along the edges of marshes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
