    "intro": "Scirpus aegialites, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in saline or brackish environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Scirpus aegialites plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
