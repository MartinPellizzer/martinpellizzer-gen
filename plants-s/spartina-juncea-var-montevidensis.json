    "intro": "Spartina juncea var. montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand saltwater and fluctuating water levels. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland species."
