    "intro": "Selaginella biauriculata, commonly known as the two-lobed spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
