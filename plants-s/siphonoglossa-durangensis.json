    "intro": "Siphonoglossa durangensis, commonly known as the Durango siphonoglossa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
