    "intro": "Sibiraea angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf sandarac, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is historically valued for its resinous sap, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Sibiraea angustata typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters."
