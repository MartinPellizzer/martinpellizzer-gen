It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean flora and a subject of ecological study."
