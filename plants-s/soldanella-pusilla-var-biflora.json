    "intro": "Soldanella pusilla var. biflora, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a low-growing rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its compact form and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
