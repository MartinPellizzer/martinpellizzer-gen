    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subvar. elatior, commonly known as the tall saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically basal, rosette-forming, and have a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This subvariety is distinguished by its taller stature compared to the typical form of Saxifraga cespitosa."
