    "intro": "Sphaeralcea caespitosa var. caespitosa, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a low, mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. Its leaves are succulent and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
