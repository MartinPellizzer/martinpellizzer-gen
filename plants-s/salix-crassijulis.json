    "intro": "Salix crassijulis, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically produced in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix crassijulis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
