    "intro": "Salvia clarendonensis, commonly known as the Clarendon sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native habitat."
