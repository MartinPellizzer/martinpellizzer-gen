    "intro": "Salix ganderi, commonly known as Gander's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salix genus, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
