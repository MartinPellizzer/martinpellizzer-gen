    "intro": "Sporobolus hockii, commonly known as Hock's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray tint, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Sporobolus hockii is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
