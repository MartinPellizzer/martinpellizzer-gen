    "intro": "Smilax subsessiliflora, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed devil's backbone, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features dark green, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its berries are red when mature and contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Smilax subsessiliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets."
