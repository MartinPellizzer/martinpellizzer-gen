    "intro": "Styphelia macraei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of southeastern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental appeal to its compact form. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and forest margins. Styphelia macraei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
