    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with separate male and female flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in riparian ecosystems."
