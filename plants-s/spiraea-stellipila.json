    "intro": "Spiraea stellipila, commonly known as the starflower spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Spiraea stellipila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
