    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos parvulum, commonly known as the small-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse conditions to ensure its survival."
