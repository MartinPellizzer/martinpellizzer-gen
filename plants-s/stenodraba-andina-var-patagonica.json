    "intro": "Stenodraba andina var. patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. The plant has compact, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh habitat. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the extreme conditions of the Patagonian region."
