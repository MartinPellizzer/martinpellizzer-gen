    "intro": "Schkuhria anthemoidea var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in elongated clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments with minimal water availability."
