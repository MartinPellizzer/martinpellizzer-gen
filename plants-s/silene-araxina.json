    "intro": "Silene araxina, commonly known as the Armenian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene araxina is often found in open, sunny areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
