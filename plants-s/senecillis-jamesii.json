    "intro": "Senecillis jamesii, commonly known as the James' goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small golden spheres. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue tint that helps reduce water loss."
