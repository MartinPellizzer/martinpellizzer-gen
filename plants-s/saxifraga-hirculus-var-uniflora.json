    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower, usually a pink or purple bell-shaped bloom, during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
