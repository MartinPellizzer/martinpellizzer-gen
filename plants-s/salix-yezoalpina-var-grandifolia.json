    "intro": "Salix yezoalpina var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
