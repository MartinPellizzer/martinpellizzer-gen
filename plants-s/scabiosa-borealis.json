It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapting to the low-nutrient conditions of its habitat. Scabiosa borealis plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native ecosystems."
