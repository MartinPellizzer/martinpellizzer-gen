    "intro": "Sorbus sibirica subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the Siberian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which give way to red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The subspecies glabrata is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) stems and leaves, setting it apart from other varieties within the Sorbus sibirica species complex."
