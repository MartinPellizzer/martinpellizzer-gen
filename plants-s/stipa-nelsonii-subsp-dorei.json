    "intro": "Stipa nelsonii subsp. dorei, commonly known as Dore's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
