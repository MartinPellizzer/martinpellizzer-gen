    "intro": "Solanum pyriforme var. uniflorum, commonly known as the one-flowered nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features ovate to elliptic leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces solitary, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant bears small, yellow, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
