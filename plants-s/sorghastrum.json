    "intro": "Sorghastrum, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a genus of grasses native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically small and arranged in panicles, often with a distinctive silver or white hue. Sorghastrum species are drought-tolerant and thrive in sandy or well-drained soils. They are often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
