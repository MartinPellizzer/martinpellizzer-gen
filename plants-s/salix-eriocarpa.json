    "intro": "Salix eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Salix eriocarpa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
