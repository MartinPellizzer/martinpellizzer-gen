    "intro": "Strychnos gracillima, commonly known as the slender-stemmed strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing toxic seeds. Due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, it is considered poisonous and should be handled with care. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in toxicology and plant morphology."
