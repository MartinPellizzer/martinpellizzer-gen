    "intro": "Syzygium waterhousei, commonly known as Waterhouse\u2019s tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Syzygium waterhousei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is considered a species of conservation concern."
