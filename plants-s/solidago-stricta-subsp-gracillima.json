    "intro": "Solidago stricta subsp. gracillima, commonly known as the slender goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant features erect, slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late summer. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a distinctive grayish-green color due to the presence of fine pubescence. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
