    "intro": "Salsola arborescens var. richteri, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its adaptations include deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces that reduce water loss. This species is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion."
