    "intro": "Schradera montana, commonly known as the mountain schradera, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes other genera such as Oncidium and Epilobium. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptation to cold, mountainous environments. Schradera montana is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
