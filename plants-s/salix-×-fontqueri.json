    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fontqueri, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Salix nigra and Salix discolor, characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a finely toothed margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. Salix \u00d7 fontqueri is often found in moist, shaded areas such as stream banks and woodland edges."
