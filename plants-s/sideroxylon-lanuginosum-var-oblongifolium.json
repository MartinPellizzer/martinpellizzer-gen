    "intro": "Sideroxylon lanuginosum var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the woolly ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical or oblong in shape, hence the species name oblongifolium. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, elongated fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils."
