    "intro": "Samolus nudicaulis, commonly known as the small-flowered samolus, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, branched stems that are covered with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are often surrounded by a ring of small, leaf-like bracts. Samolus nudicaulis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
