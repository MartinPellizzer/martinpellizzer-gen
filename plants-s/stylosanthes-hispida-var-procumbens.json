    "intro": "Stylosanthes hispida var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate stylosanthes, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to cover the ground effectively, often used in erosion control and as a forage crop. Stylosanthes hispida var. procumbens is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and resilience in harsh conditions."
