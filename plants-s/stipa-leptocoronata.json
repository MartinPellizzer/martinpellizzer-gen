    "intro": "Stipa leptocoronata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to golden spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Stipa leptocoronata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
