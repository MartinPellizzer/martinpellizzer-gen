    "intro": "Scleria canaliculatotriquetra var. adpressohirta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact, bulbous rhizomes. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often compressed and hirsute, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically during the spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, making it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
