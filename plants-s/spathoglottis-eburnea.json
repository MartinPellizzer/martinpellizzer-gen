    "intro": "Spathoglottis eburnea, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, often as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the air and rainwater. The leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its humid environment."
