It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its delicate appearance and unique floral structure make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
