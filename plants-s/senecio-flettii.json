    "intro": "Senecio flettii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh desert conditions with its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio flettii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
