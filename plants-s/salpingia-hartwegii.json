    "intro": "Salpingia hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a trap for insects, a feature typical of the genus Salpingia. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a reddish tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments such as greenhouses."
