    "intro": "Sunania filiformis f. amabilis, commonly known as the Amabilis form of the slender sunania, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and shaded environments, thriving at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its foliage is evergreen, with narrow, leathery leaves that provide a dense canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
