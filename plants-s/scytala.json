These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, yellowish to reddish composite flowers. Scytala species are typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They have fibrous roots and produce a milky sap that is often latex-like. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture."
