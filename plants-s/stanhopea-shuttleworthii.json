    "intro": "Stanhopea shuttleworthii, commonly known as the Shuttleworth's stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white, with intricate patterns that resemble the wings of a butterfly. The plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence that can reach up to 30 cm in length, bearing several blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid gardens."
