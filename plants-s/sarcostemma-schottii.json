    "intro": "Sarcostemma schottii, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing the seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and wastelands, and is adapted to grow in dry and semi-arid conditions. Sarcostemma schottii is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
