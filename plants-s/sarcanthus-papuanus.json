    "intro": "Sarcanthus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Sarcanthus papuanus is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
