    "intro": "Sinapis integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth mustard, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustard. The plant is characterized by its erect stem, alternate leaves that are entire or slightly lobed, and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular pod, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Sinapis integrifolia is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a cover crop in agriculture."
