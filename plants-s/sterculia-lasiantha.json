It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
