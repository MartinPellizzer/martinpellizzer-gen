It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in summer, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native gardens and conservation efforts."
