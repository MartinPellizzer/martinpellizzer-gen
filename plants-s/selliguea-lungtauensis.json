    "intro": "Selliguea lungtauensis, commonly known as the Lungtau moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely spaced, overlapping leaves. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct midrib, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Selliguea lungtauensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
