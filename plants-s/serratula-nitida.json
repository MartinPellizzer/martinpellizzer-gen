    "intro": "Serratula nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf tansy, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, contributing to its silvery hue. Serratula nitida is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
