    "intro": "Solanum indicum subsp. zechii, commonly known as the Indian nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and\u5375\u5f62 (ovate) leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
