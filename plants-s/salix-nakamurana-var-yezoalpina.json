    "intro": "Salix nakamurana var. yezoalpina, commonly known as Yezo alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Hokkaido, Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, typically flowering in early spring. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
