    "intro": "Sphaerocionium prionema, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow to orange coloration, which is due to the presence of carotenoids. The plant has a thallus that is typically lobed and covered with small, rounded structures called gemmae, which aid in vegetative reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Sphaerocionium prionema is a non-vascular plant that plays an important role in soil stabilization and habitat formation for microorganisms."
