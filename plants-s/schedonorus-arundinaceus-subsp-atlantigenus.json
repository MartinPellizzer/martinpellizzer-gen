    "intro": "Schedonorus arundinaceus subsp. atlantigenus, commonly known as the Atlantic meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
