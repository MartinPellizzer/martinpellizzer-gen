    "intro": "Sedum caffrum, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
