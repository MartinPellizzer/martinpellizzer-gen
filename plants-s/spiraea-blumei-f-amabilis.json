    "intro": "Spiraea blumei f. amabilis, commonly known as the amiable spiraea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a deep green, providing a striking contrast to its clusters of white, cone-shaped flowers. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
