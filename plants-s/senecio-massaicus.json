    "intro": "Senecio massaicus, commonly known as the Massaicus groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Senecio massaicus is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their composite flower heads."
