    "intro": "Sagina maritima subsp. rodriguezii, commonly known as the Rodriguez's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and along rocky shores. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. This subspecies is well-suited to coastal habitats due to its salt tolerance and ability to withstand wind exposure."
