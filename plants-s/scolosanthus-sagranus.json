    "intro": "Scolosanthus sagranus, commonly known as the mountain onion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy bulbs that are often used in traditional Andean medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Scolosanthus sagranus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
