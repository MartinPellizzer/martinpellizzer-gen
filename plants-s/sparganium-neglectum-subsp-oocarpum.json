    "intro": "Sparganium neglectum subsp. oocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers. Its fruiting structures, called nutlets, are covered in spiny projections, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged environments."
