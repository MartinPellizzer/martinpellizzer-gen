    "intro": "Saxifraga rivularis var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats, such as stream banks and mountain meadows. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other saxifrage species."
