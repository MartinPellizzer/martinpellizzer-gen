    "intro": "Saxifraga tigrina, commonly known as the tiger's tooth saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves that resemble the jagged teeth of a tiger, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments. Saxifraga tigrina is adapted to cold climates and is typically hardy in USDA zones 4 to 7."
