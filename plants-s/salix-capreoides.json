    "intro": "Salix capreoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix capreoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or mountainous habitats."
