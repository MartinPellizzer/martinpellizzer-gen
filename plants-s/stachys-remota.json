    "intro": "Stachys remota, commonly known as the remote hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Stachys remota is often found in rocky or disturbed soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
