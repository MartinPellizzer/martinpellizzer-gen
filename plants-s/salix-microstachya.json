    "intro": "Salix microstachya, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing form, typically reaching heights of only a few centimeters, and its slender, flexible stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Salix microstachya plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic wildlife species."
