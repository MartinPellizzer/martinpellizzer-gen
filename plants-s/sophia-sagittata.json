    "intro": "Sophia sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often arrowhead-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wetland indicator species and its use in ecological restoration projects."
