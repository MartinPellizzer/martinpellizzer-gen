    "intro": "Schizonotus discolor var. dumosus, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble those of true dandelions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
