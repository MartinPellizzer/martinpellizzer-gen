    "intro": "Spinacia oleracea var. bullata, commonly known as the bullate spinach, is a variant of spinach characterized by its distinctive, warty leaves. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is cultivated for its edible leaves, which are slightly more bitter than regular spinach. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The leaves are typically harvested before they become too tough, usually around 45 to 60 days after sowing. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and nutritional content, similar to other spinach varieties."
