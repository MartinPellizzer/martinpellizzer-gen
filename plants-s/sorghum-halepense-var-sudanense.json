    "intro": "Sorghum halepense var. sudanense, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, sword-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types. Sudan grass is often used as forage for livestock and for erosion control due to its vigorous growth and deep root system."
