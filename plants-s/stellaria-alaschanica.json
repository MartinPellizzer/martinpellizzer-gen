    "intro": "Stellaria alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaska starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Stellaria alaschanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
