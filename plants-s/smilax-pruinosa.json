    "intro": "Smilax pruinosa, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with a distinctive grayish-silver coating, which gives it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Smilax pruinosa is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and thickets."
