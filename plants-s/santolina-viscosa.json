    "intro": "Santolina viscosa, commonly known as woolly lavender or Spanish santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which give it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina viscosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
