    "intro": "Spigelia polita, commonly known as the smooth spigelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of red, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their color and shape. Spigelia polita is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
