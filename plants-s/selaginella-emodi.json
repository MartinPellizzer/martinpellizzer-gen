    "intro": "Selaginella emodi, commonly known as the Himalayan spike moss, is a species of spikemoss found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments on rocky substrates. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves and a creeping stem system. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Selaginella emodi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
