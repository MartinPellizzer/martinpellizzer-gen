    "intro": "Salix eburnea, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white to pale green bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces catkins, which are its flowers, and is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies. This species is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments."
