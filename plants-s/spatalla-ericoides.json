    "intro": "Spatalla ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Spatalla ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
