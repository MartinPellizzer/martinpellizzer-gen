    "intro": "Salix hibernica, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix hibernica is valued for its fast growth and ability to stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
