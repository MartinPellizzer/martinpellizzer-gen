    "intro": "Salix cerasifolia, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are bright green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, white layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is closely related to other willow species and is often found in moist, temperate habitats."
