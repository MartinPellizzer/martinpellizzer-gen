    "intro": "Senecillis caloxantha, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a short, woody stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Senecillis caloxantha is considered a rare and endangered species."
