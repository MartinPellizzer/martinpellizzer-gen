    "intro": "Scleromitrion kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in dry climates."
