    "intro": "Senecio cerrateae, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio cerrateae produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
