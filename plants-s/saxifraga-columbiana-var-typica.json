    "intro": "Saxifraga columbiana var. typica, commonly known as the Cascade saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with cool, humid conditions."
