    "intro": "Sagittaria arifolia var. tenuor, commonly known as narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or rise from the water, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's edge. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sediments make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
