    "intro": "Salix daguanensis, commonly known as the Daguan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
