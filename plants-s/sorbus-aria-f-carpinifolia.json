    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. carpinifolia, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth and smaller leaves compared to the typical Sorbus aria."
