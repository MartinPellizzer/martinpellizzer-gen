    "intro": "Scrophularia papillaris, commonly known as the rough scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The plant features upright stems that are covered in fine, papillate (bump-like) structures, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem, and bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
