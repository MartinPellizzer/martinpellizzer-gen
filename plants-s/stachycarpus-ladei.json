    "intro": "Stachycarpus ladei, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a tall, tree-like fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a trunk that is covered in fibrous, woody tissue. The plant has feather-like fronds that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the trunk, and it produces spores in specialized structures called soruses. Stachycarpus ladei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
