    "intro": "Sassafras officinarum, commonly known as wild sarsaparilla, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its roots and leaves have been historically used in herbal medicine for their aromatic and purported medicinal properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
