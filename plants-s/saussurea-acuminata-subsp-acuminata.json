    "intro": "Saussurea acuminata subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and pale yellow to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, achene-like seeds. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
