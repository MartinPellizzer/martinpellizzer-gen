    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. microstachia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are grouped in clusters and serve as the primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for erosion control and habitat restoration."
