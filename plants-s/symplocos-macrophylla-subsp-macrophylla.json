It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
