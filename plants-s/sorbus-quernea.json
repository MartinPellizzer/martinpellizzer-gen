    "intro": "Sorbus quernea, commonly known as the blackthorn or European rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive black fruits. Sorbus quernea is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
