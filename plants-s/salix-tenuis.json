    "intro": "Salix tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and wetlands. Salix tenuis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
