    "intro": "Senegalia pennata, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species for dry environments. Senegalia pennata is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
