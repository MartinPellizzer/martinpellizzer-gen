    "intro": "Sorbus albopilosa, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its white or pale yellow leaves, which are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Sorbus albopilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native environment."
