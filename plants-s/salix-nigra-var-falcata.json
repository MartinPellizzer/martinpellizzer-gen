    "intro": "Salix nigra var. falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow or black willow variant, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. Its root system is fibrous and can help stabilize soil, making it useful in riparian areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands."
