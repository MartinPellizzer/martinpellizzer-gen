    "intro": "Stachys palustris f. hispidula, commonly known as hairy water betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a reddish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a reddish or purple hue, contributing to its ornamental value. This subspecies is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks."
