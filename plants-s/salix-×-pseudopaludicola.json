    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pseudopaludicola, commonly known as the black willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland areas of North America. It is a hybrid between Salix nigra (black willow) and Salix lucida (swamp willow), exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant has slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is often found in moist soils along streams, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
