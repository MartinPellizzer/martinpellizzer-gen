It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, often weeping growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it typically blooms in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and landscape design."
