    "intro": "Stipa pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, showing adaptability to arid conditions. Stipa pavlovii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
