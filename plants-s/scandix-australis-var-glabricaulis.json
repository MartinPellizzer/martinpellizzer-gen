    "intro": "Scandix australis var. glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed southern scaldweed, is a flowering plant native to southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, smooth-stemmed structure and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often arranged in whorls around the stems. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through its reduced leaf surface area. It plays a minor ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators."
