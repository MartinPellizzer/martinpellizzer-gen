    "intro": "Salvia paupercula, commonly known as the poor man's sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Salvia paupercula is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
