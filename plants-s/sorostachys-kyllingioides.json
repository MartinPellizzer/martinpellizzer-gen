    "intro": "Sorostachys kyllingioides, commonly known as the golden star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
