    "intro": "Saxifraga matt-viridish, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Saxifraga matt-viridish is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
