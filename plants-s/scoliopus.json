    "intro": "Scoliopus, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Saururaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. Scoliopus species are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. They have simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Scoliopus lanceolatus and Scoliopus tetraphyllus, which are native to North America."
