    "intro": "Senna oxyphylla, commonly known as the yellow senna, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is notable for its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and the plant can grow up to several meters in height. Senna oxyphylla is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
