    "intro": "Sorghum amplum, commonly known as the tall sorghum, is a robust annual grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a striking plant in both natural and cultivated settings. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, typically in shades of red, purple, or green, depending on the variety. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Sorghum amplum is often grown for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional agriculture for grain production."
