    "intro": "Solanum congestiflorum var. pannosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. These flowers give way to berries that start green and mature to a deep red or black color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
