It features broad, dark green, waxy leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by bright yellow berries. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its air-purifying qualities and elegant foliage make it both ornamental and beneficial for indoor environments."
