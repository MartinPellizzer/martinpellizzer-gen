    "intro": "Solanum indicum subsp. olivaceum, commonly known as the Indian nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berry-like fruits, which are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
