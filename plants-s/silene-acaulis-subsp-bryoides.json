    "intro": "Silene acaulis subsp. bryoides, commonly known as the cushion sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, thriving in conditions of high sunlight and low moisture. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops."
