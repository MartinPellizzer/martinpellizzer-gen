    "intro": "Salix urbaniana monstr. nematadenia, commonly known as the urbaniana willow, is a rare and unique willow species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow catkins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, often turning reddish in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
