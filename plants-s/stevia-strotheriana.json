    "intro": "Stevia strotheriana, commonly known as the Strother's stevia, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Stevia strotheriana is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of natural sweeteners in alternative medicine and food products."
