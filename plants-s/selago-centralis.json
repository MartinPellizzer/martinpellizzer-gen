    "intro": "Selago centralis, commonly known as the central selago, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a subtle, spicy scent. Selago centralis is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers."
