    "intro": "Senecio caespitosus, commonly known as the ice plant or white ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments."
