    "intro": "Sisymbrium titicacense, commonly known as the Andean rocket, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
