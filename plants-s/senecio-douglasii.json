    "intro": "Senecio douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
