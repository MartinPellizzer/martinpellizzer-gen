    "intro": "Sedum aureum, commonly known as the golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to Eurasia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its low maintenance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
