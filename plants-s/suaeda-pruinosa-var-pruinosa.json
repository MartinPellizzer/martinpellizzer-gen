    "intro": "Suaeda pruinosa var. pruinosa, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, enabling survival in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and minimize water loss. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
