    "intro": "Salix phanera, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
