    "intro": "Sporobolus pinetorum, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in coastal habitats."
