    "intro": "Stipa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, cushion-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common ornamental plant in gardens and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
