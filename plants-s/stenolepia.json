    "intro": "Stenolepia, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are known for their striking, often fragrant flowers. Stenolepia species typically have elongated, narrow leaves and produce showy, pendulous blooms that can range in color from white to yellow and orange. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and require well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in horticulture, though they are relatively rare in the wild."
