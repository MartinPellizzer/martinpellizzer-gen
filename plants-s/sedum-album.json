    "intro": "Sedum album, commonly known as white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and can thrive in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sedum album is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
