    "intro": "Senecio pinnatulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
