    "intro": "Statice albicans, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty air and harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Statice albicans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
