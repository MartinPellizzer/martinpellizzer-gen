It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The leaves are usually pale green and have a fine, silky texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
