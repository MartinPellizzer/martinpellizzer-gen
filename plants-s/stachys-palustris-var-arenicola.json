    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. arenicola, commonly known as sand betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and gravelly habitats in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
