    "intro": "Stellaria arenicola, commonly known as sand starwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and disturbed areas. The plant has small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Stellaria arenicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
