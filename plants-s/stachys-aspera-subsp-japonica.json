    "intro": "Stachys aspera subsp. japonica, commonly known as Japanese hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features upright stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale purple to pink flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas."
