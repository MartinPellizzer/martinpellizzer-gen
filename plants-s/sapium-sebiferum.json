    "intro": "Sapium sebiferum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing orange seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to various parts of the world. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
