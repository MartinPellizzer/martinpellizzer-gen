    "intro": "Serratula imbricata, commonly known as the creeping tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are serrated and hairy, and the plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Serratula imbricata is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
