    "intro": "Salix venulosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, making it a dioecious species. Its leaves are usually a bright green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a slightly serrated edge. Salix venulosa is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
