It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Severinia trimera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
