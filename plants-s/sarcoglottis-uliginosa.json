It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant's leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are usually greenish or purple with a distinctive, complex structure. Sarcoglottis uliginosa thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
