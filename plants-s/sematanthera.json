    "intro": "Sematanthera, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sematanthera is considered a threatened species in its native range."
