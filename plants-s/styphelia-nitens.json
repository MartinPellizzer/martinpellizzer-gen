    "intro": "Styphelia nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southern Australia. It features small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine silvery coating, giving it its common name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires cool, moist conditions. Styphelia nitens is often found in coastal and inland heath communities, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
