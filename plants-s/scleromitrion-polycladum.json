    "intro": "Scleromitrion polycladum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It has a shallow root system that helps it anchor in loose, rocky soils. Scleromitrion polycladum is often found in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure."
