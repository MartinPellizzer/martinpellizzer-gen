It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. Its foliage is fine and grass-like, with narrow, green blades that are often slightly hairy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry, coastal environments."
