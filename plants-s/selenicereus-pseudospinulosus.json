It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
