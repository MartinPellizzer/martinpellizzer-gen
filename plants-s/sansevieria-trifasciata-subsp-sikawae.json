It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with light green or yellowish variegation. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in low light conditions and requires minimal watering. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in arid environments. This subspecies is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
