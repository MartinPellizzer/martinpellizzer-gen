    "intro": "Salix sericeocinerea var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-white, silky hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
