    "intro": "Stizolobium pseudostizolobium, commonly known as the African burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hairy, spiny pods that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry and land rehabilitation efforts."
