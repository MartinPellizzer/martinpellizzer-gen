It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Sclerolaena capensis and Sclerolaena argentea. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, preferring full sun. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
