    "intro": "Solanum collectaneum, commonly known as the clustered nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, typical of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
