    "intro": "Stellaria altimontana, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a small perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often grow in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Stellaria altimontana is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous terrains."
