    "intro": "Stelis trochophora, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a unique spiral arrangement of petals and sepals."
