    "intro": "Subpilocereus albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, light green stems and white spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its unique features, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in cactus gardens."
