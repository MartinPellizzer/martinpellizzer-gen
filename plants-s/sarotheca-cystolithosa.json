    "intro": "Sarotheca cystolithosa, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a lichen species that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its intricate structure, consisting of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces, often appearing as a thin, dark-colored layer. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and stabilization in harsh environments. Due to its specialized adaptations, Sarotheca cystolithosa is an important indicator of environmental conditions in semi-arid regions."
