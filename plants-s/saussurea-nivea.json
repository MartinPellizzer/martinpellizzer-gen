    "intro": "Saussurea nivea, commonly known as the white saffron or snow saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh conditions. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
