    "intro": "Sarcochilus rhopalorrhachis, commonly known as the long-veined sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a dense, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Sarcochilus rhopalorrhachis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
