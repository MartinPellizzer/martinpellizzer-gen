    "intro": "Stipa setigera, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements due to their aesthetic appeal. Stipa setigera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
