    "intro": "Salvadora persica var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered arak tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, reddish-brown fruits containing a single seed. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in poor, sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum."
