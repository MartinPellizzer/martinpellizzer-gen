    "intro": "Sorghum halepense var. mekongense, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically green or brown in color. Its rhizomes are robust and enable it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in wetland areas. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy environments."
