    "intro": "Serratula modestii, commonly known as the desert golden crown, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation across open, rocky habitats. Serratula modestii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
