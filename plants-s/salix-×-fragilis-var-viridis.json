    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. viridis, commonly known as the green weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its slender, drooping branches and bright green foliage. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and water features. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. This plant prefers moist soil and full sun, making it suitable for riparian zones and pond edges. It is relatively fast-growing and can reach heights of up to 15 meters, though it is generally smaller in cultivated forms."
