    "intro": "Spongopyrena, commonly known as the sponge-like sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Siphonophorae. It is characterized by its translucent, gelatinous body that resembles a sponge, hence its common name. The organism lacks a true medusa stage and instead exists as a colony of specialized polyps working together. Spongopyrena is typically found in deep ocean waters, where it thrives in low-light conditions. Its unique structure allows it to capture prey efficiently through its extended tentacles."
