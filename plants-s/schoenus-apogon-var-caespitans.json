    "intro": "Schoenus apogon var. caespitans, commonly known as the tufted marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It forms dense, clump-like growths with slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the base, creating a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in marshy or seasonally flooded environments. This variant is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems."
