    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor var. muricata, commonly known as the purple tansy, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that are often hairy, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that have toothed margins. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by bracts that are often more showy than the blooms themselves. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine, while the plant is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal. Sanguisorba minor var. muricata prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
