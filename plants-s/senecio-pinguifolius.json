    "intro": "Senecio pinguifolius, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble snowballs, hence its common name. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Senecio pinguifolius is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap that can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
