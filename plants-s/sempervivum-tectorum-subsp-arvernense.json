    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum subsp. arvernense, commonly known as the Alsatian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France and Switzerland. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
