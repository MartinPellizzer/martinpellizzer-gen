    "intro": "Scutellaria galericulata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered blueweed, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Scutellaria genus. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
