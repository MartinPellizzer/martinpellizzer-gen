    "intro": "Stewartia montana, commonly known as the mountain stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, elongated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by ornamental, cone-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Stewartia montana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
