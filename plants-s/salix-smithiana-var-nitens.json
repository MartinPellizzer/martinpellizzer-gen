    "intro": "Salix smithiana var. nitens, commonly known as the nitens willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
