    "intro": "Stenostomum shaferi, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage with dense hair covering the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Stenostomum shaferi is well adapted to drought and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
