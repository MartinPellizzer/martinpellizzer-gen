    "intro": "Salix recondita, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including the Himalayas and Tibet. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix recondita is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies of high-altitude ecosystems."
