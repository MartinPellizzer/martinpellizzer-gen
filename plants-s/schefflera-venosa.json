    "intro": "Schefflera venosa, commonly known as the Variegated Umbrella Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, umbrella-like crown of large, palmately compound leaves with a striking variegated pattern of green, white, and cream. The plant has a short, sturdy stem and can grow up to 10 feet tall in its natural habitat. Its leaves are glossy and often have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Schefflera venosa is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
