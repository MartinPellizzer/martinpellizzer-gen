    "intro": "Sibbaldia purpurea var. pentaphylla, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in rocky or barren soils."
