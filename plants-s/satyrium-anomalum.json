    "intro": "Satyrium anomalum, commonly known as the anomalous orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
