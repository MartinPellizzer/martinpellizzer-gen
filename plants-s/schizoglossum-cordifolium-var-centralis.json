    "intro": "Schizoglossum cordifolium var. centralis, commonly known as the central heartleaf schizoglossum, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical or subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
