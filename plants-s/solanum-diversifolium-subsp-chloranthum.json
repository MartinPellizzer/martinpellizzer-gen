    "intro": "Solanum diversifolium subsp. chloranthum, commonly known as the greenleaf nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, ranging from ovate to lanceolate, and its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
