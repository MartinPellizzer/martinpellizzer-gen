    "intro": "Sedum palustre, commonly known as swamp stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It has fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to retain moisture. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Sedum palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems."
