    "intro": "Scirpus capensis, commonly known as the Cape bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in wetland environments. Scirpus capensis is adapted to saline and brackish conditions, making it an important component of coastal and estuarine ecosystems."
