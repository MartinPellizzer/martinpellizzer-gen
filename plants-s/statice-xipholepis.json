    "intro": "Statice xipholepis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize coastal sands, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Statice xipholepis is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in dried flower arrangements."
