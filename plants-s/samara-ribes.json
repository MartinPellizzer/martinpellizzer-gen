    "intro": "Samara ribes, commonly known as the redcurrant, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, red, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and commonly used in jams and desserts. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five pink or white petals, and it relies on insects for pollination. The samara ribes is also notable for its fruit type, which is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
