    "intro": "Saxifraga andicola, commonly known as the Andean saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It is often found in alpine meadows and on slopes where the soil is thin. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
