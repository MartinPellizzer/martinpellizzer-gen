    "intro": "Saussurea medusa, commonly known as the \"Medusa's crown,\" is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has feathery, gray-green leaves that are adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. Its scientific name refers to the mythological figure Medusa, due to the plant's distinctive, hair-like structures on its flower heads. Saussurea medusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
