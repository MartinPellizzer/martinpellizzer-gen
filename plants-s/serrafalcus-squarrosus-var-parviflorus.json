    "intro": "Serrafalcus squarrosus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are narrow and pointed, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
