    "intro": "Stropha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically followed by distinctive, triangular seed pods. Stropha is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
