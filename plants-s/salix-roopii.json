    "intro": "Salix roopii, commonly known as the Afghan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix roopii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
