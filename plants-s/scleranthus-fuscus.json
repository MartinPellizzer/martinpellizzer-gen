    "intro": "Scleranthus fuscus, commonly known as the brown cocklebur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, branching stems covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces rough, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing."
