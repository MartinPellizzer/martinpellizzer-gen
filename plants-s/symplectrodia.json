The plant is native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Symplectrodia has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom briefly during the night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
