    "intro": "Scolophyllum ilicifolium, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits called \"tunas.\" Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive drought conditions. Scolophyllum ilicifolium is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in various cultures."
