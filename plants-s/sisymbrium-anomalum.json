It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is found in various regions of Europe and Asia, often growing in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
