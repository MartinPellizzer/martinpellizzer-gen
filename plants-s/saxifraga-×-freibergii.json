    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 freibergii, commonly known as the Freiberg saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga myrtilloides. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often with rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant is native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
