    "intro": "Satyrium nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Himalayan region of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
