    "intro": "Solanum flagellare, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with thin, hairy stems that can root at the nodes. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by bright yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
