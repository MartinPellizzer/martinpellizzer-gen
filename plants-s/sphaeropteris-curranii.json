    "intro": "Sphaeropteris curranii, commonly known as the Curran's cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphaeropteris curranii is considered a vulnerable species."
