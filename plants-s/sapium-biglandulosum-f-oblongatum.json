    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum f. oblongatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf Chinese tallowtree, is a variant of the Chinese tallowtree characterized by its elongated, oblong leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China, belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant features smooth, gray bark and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, lantern-like fruits. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
