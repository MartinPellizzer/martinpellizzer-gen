    "intro": "Sturmia lucida, commonly known as the white sand cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Sturmia lucida is well adapted to harsh, sunny environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
