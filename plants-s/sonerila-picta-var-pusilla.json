    "intro": "Sonerila picta var. pusilla, commonly known as the small picta sonerila, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening and small garden spaces. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
