    "intro": "Stapelia melanantha, commonly known as the Black Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a dark center. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
