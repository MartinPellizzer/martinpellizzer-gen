    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor subsp. glaucescens, commonly known as blue stemmed sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its blue-green stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
