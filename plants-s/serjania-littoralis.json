    "intro": "Serjania littoralis, commonly known as the coastal serjania, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal regions of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Serjania littoralis is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
