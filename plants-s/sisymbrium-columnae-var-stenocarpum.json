    "intro": "Sisymbrium columnae var. stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-capsule broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its flowering structure known as a scorpioid cyme. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a narrow, elongated pod, which is a distinguishing feature of the variety stenocarpum. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be a challenge for agricultural crops due to its parasitic nature."
