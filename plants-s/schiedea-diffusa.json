    "intro": "Schiedea diffusa, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow flowers. It thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101 and other Hawaiian summits. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is classified as endangered."
