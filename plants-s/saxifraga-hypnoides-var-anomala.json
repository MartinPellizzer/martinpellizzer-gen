    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides var. anomala, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, hairy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to extreme climates with short growing seasons."
