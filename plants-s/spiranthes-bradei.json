    "intro": "Spiranthes bradei, commonly known as the Brade's ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
