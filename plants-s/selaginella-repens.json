    "intro": "Selaginella repens, commonly known as thread moss or running spikerush, is a low-growing, perennial plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that form dense mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain both microspores and megaspores, facilitating its reproductive cycle. Selaginella repens is adapted to thrive in humid climates and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
