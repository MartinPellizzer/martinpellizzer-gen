It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in the spring, and its bark is smooth and pale gray. Salix dissa is often found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and meadows."
