It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and appear in late summer, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
