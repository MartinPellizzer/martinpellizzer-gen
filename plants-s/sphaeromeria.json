    "intro": "Sphaeromeria, commonly known as the globular aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid regions. Sphaeromeria species are characterized by their spherical or globular flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The plants typically have a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves, and they produce vibrant yellow or orange flowers. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
