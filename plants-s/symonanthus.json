    "intro": "Symonanthus, commonly known as the star anise plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits. The most well-known species, Symonanthus aromaticus, produces small, capsule-like fruits that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and have simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are usually white or pale green and are clustered in umbels, contributing to the plant's ornamental value."
