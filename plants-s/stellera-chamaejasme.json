    "intro": "Stellera chamaejasme, commonly known as white sandroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the plant is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils. Stellera chamaejasme is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
