    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. linguaeformis, commonly known as the tongue-shaped saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive tongue-like shape. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
