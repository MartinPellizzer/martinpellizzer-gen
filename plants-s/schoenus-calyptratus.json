    "intro": "Schoenus calyptratus, commonly known as the Cape rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often hidden beneath a hood-like structure, giving it its scientific name \"calyptratus,\" meaning \"hooded.\" Schoenus calyptratus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
