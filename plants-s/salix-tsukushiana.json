    "intro": "Salix tsukushiana, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth texture and a serrated edge. Salix tsukushiana thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found near water bodies in its natural habitat."
