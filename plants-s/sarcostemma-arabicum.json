    "intro": "Sarcostemma arabicum, commonly known as the Indian milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to the arid regions of India and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in wastelands and along roadsides. Sarcostemma arabicum is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxic nature."
