    "intro": "Salsola lanata, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, often forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense heads, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse easily by wind. Salsola lanata is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in many regions."
