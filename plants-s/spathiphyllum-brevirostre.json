    "intro": "Spathiphyllum brevirostre, commonly known as the narrow-beaked peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, white, spatulate flowers that resemble a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum brevirostre is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
