    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia var. partita, commonly known as the divided saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
