    "intro": "Scleranthus procerus, commonly known as the tall cocklebur, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features upright stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense spikes, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Scleranthus procerus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
