    "intro": "Stemonurus megacarpus, commonly known as the giant cup fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, fertile fronds that produce numerous spore-bearing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in anchoring it to the substrate. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification."
