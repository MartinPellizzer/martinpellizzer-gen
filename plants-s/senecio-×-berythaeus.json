    "intro": "Senecio \u00d7 berythaeus, commonly known as the hybrid groundsel, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It is a hybrid between Senecio serotinus and Senecio crassipes, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It produces daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fibrous roots and low-growing habit make it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
