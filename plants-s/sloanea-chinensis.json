    "intro": "Sloanea chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive three-lobed, red or purple fruits. Sloanea chinensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
