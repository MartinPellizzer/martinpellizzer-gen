    "intro": "Sempervivum frigidum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and is relatively easy to care for in gardens with low maintenance requirements."
