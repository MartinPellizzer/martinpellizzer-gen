    "intro": "Sphaeralcea ambigua var. aculeata, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant features showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and sometimes spiny, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
