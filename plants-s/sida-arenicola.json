    "intro": "Sida arenicola, commonly known as beach sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dunes and beach environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and hairy to reduce water loss. Sida arenicola has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. It is adapted to salt spray and high sunlight, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal conditions."
