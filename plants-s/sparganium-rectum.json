It has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, typically floating or partially submerged. Sparganium rectum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
