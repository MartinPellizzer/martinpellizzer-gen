    "intro": "Selaginella undata, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain the spores. Selaginella undata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to survive in arid conditions due to its ability to enter a state of dormancy."
