    "intro": "Sabicea sciaphilantha subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sabicea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in low-light conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a serrated margin, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
