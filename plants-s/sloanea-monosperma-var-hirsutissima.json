    "intro": "Sloanea monosperma var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and contributes to its distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a prominent midrib. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage."
