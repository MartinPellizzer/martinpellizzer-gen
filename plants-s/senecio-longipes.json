    "intro": "Senecio longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed groundsel, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Senecio longipes is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
