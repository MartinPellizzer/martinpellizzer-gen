    "intro": "Salix patula, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and bright green. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. The bark of Salix patula has been used historically for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory effects."
