    "intro": "Salix lasiandra var. recomponens, commonly known as the red willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive red-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in riparian habitats."
