    "intro": "Stipa gigantea subsp. donyanae, commonly known as the Donyana giant feathergrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of florets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique visual presence."
