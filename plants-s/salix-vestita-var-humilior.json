    "intro": "Salix vestita var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and harsh environmental conditions."
