    "intro": "Stapelia anguinea, commonly known as the snake plant or viper's bugloss, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are often ribbed and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Stapelia anguinea is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
