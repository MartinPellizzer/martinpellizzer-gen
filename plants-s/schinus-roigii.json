    "intro": "Schinus roigii, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, red berries. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers and evergreen foliage. It can grow as a tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
