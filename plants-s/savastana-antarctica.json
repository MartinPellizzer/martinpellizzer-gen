    "intro": "Savastana antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in harsh, icy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom close to the ground. It plays a vital role in the sparse vegetation of the Antarctic ecosystem. Due to its resilience, it is one of the few plant species capable of surviving in such extreme conditions."
