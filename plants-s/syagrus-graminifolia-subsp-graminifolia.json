    "intro": "Syagrus graminifolia subsp. graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-palm, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its foliage is often used in local crafts, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
