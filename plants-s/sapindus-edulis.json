    "intro": "Sapindus edulis, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces smooth, green fruits that mature into spiny, orange-red berries. The fruit's outer layer contains a rich source of saponins, which are naturally occurring detergents. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional use in soap-making."
