It is characterized by its broad, wavy-edged leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schismatoglottis subundulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
