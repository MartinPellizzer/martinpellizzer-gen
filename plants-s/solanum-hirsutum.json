    "intro": "Solanum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic compounds. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided as a food source and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
