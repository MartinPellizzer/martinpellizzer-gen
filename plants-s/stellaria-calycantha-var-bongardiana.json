    "intro": "Stellaria calycantha var. bongardiana, commonly known as Bongard's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to high-altitude environments."
