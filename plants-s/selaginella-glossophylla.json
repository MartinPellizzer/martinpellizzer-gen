    "intro": "Selaginella glossophylla, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching structure that resembles a club. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical and subtropical forests. Selaginella glossophylla produces spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
