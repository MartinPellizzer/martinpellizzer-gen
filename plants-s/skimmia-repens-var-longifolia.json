    "intro": "Skimmia repens var. longifolia, commonly known as the creeping skimmia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like form along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value lies in its evergreen foliage and seasonal floral display."
