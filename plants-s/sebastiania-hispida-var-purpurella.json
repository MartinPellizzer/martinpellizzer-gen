It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant is notable for its ornamental value, particularly due to its striking purple sepals. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for cultivation in warm, humid climates."
