    "intro": "Sonchus angustissimus, commonly known as narrowleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into achene fruits, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
