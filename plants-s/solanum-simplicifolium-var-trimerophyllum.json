    "intro": "Solanum simplicifolium var. trimerophyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
