    "intro": "Saussurea retroserrata, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy composite flower heads that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, pale yellow florets arranged in a disc-like structure surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saussurea retroserrata is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
