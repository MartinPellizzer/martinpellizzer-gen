    "intro": "Stachys sylvatica var. pallida, commonly known as white wood betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a soft, velvety feel. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and long-lasting blooms."
