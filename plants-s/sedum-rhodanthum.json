It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the winter months, typically around December to January. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a striking addition to any succulent collection."
