    "intro": "Strempelia ceratopetala, commonly known as the horned rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like petals that give it its common name, and it typically grows in rocky or limestone substrates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
