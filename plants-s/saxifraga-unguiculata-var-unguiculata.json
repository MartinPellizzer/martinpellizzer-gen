    "intro": "Saxifraga unguiculata var. unguiculata, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh climates with short growing seasons. This species is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
