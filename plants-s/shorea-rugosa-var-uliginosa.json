It is a tree that typically grows in swampy or brackish water environments, adapting to high salinity and waterlogged soils. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal areas and prevent erosion. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and resistance to decay. This species plays a vital role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems."
