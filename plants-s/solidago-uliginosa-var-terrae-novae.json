    "intro": "Solidago uliginosa var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Terra Nova goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh maritime conditions and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
