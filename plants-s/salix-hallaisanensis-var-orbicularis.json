    "intro": "Salix hallaisanensis var. orbicularis, commonly known as the Korean weeping willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to South Korea. It is characterized by its narrow, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, typical of many willow species. The leaves are typically oval or orbicular in shape, hence the variety name, and are a bright green during the growing season. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
