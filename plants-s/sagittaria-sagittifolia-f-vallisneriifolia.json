    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. vallisneriifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its broader, more lance-shaped leaves. It is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
