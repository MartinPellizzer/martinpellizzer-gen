    "intro": "Spanizium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate spaniard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
