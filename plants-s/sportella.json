    "intro": "Sportella, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Sportella thrives in specific, moist, acidic pine flatwood habitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is listed as an endangered species in many regions."
