    "intro": "Sansevieria thyrsiflora, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Plant,\" is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow variegation. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white, fragrant flowers, which are followed by orange-red berries. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in bright, indirect light with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
