    "intro": "Sporobolus durus, commonly known as rough sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with wiry, fibrous stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Sporobolus durus is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation and high temperatures."
