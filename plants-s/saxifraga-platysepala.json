    "intro": "Saxifraga platysepala, commonly known as the flat-sepal saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Saxifraga platysepala is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens."
