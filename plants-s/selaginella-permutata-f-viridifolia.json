    "intro": "Selaginella permutata f. viridifolia, commonly known as the green-leaf spikemoss, is a fern ally belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on specialized leaves called microsporophylls and megasporophylls. The plant's unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution."
