    "intro": "Stephanotella, commonly known as the star-shaped lichen, is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. These organisms are composite life forms consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. They are characterized by their crust-like growth form and often exhibit a distinctive star-shaped or reticulate pattern on their surface. Stephanotella species are commonly found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and tropical regions. They play an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as indicators of environmental conditions."
