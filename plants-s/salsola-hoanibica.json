    "intro": "Salsola hoanibica, commonly known as Hoanib saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is native to the arid regions of Namibia and southwestern Angola. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces tiny, greenish flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland salt flats. Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
