    "intro": "Stylidium acuminatum subsp. meridionale, commonly known as the southern stickleback orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves and produces compact inflorescences with small, greenish-yellow flowers that have a distinctive spurred labellum. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. It is a short-lived perennial, with flowering typically occurring in spring or early summer. Its unique morphology and specialized pollination mechanisms make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
