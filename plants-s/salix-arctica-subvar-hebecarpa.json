    "intro": "Salix arctica subvar. hebecarpa, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkins, which are adapted to withstand harsh cold climates. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra environments. It has a low, spreading growth habit and is one of the few willow species that can survive in such extreme conditions. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
