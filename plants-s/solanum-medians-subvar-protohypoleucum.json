    "intro": "Solanum medians subvar. protohypoleucum, commonly known as the white-flowered nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a yellowish, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not suitable for consumption and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
