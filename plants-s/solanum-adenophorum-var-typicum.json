    "intro": "Solanum adenophorum var. typicum, commonly known as horseweed, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, globose berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in pastures and degraded lands. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
