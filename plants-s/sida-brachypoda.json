    "intro": "Sida brachypoda, commonly known as littleleaf sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Malvaceae family. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Sida brachypoda is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in wetland or marshy environments."
