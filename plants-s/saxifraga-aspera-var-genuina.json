    "intro": "Saxifraga aspera var. genuina, commonly known as the rough saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of tough, hairy, and often reddish leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its horticultural value lies in its hardiness and ability to add texture to rock gardens."
