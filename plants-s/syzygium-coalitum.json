    "intro": "Syzygium coalitum, commonly known as the satinash tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are glossy, elliptical, and dark green, often with a waxy texture. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional Indigenous Australian medicine."
