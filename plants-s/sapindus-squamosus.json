    "intro": "Sapindus squamosus, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, with 11 to 23 leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. The fruit's outer layer is covered in a fine, soapy substance, which gives the plant its common name. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
