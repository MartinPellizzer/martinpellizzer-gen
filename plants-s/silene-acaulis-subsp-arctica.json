    "intro": "Silene acaulis subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of densely packed, hair-covered leaves that help insulate it against extreme cold. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology is highly specialized for survival in polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
