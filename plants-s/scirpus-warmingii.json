    "intro": "Scirpus warmingii, commonly known as the Warming's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Scirpus warmingii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
