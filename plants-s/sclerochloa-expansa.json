    "intro": "Sclerochloa expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Sclerochloa expansa is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
