    "intro": "Solanum bridgesii var. deltoideum, commonly known as the delta leaf nightshade, is a species native to parts of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, deltoid-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces berries that mature to a deep blue or black color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshades. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or forest understory habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by both livestock and humans."
