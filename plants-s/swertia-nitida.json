    "intro": "Swertia nitida, commonly known as the Himalayan gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Swertia nitida is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
