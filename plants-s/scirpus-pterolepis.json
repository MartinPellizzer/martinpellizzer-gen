    "intro": "Scirpus pterolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Scirpus pterolepis thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
