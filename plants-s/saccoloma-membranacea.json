    "intro": "Saccoloma membranacea, commonly known as the membranous saccoloma, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, membranous sheath. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Saccoloma membranacea is characterized by its unique morphology and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
