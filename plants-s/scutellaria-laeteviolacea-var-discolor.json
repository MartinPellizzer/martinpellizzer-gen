    "intro": "Scutellaria laeteviolacea var. discolor, commonly known as the purplehead skullcap, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stem, typical of the Scutellaria genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland edges and moist meadows. The varietal form discolor is distinguished by its variable flower coloration, ranging from purple to white, adding to its ornamental value."
