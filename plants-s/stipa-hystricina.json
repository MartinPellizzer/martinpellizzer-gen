    "intro": "Stipa hystricina, commonly known as the silky needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Stipa hystricina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
