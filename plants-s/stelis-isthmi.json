    "intro": "Stelis isthmi, commonly known as the Isthmus stelis, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis isthmi thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
