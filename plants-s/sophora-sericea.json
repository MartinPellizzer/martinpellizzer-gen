    "intro": "Sophora sericea, commonly known as the silky sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, flat pods and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Sophora sericea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
