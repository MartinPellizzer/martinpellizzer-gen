    "intro": "Silene sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
