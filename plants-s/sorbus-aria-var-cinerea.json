    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray sorbus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by clusters of white berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
