    "intro": "Schuebleria diffusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, leafless stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in the canopy of pine forests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Schuebleria diffusa is listed as an endangered species due to habitat destruction and limited natural range."
