    "intro": "Salicornia indica, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it is an annual species that completes its life cycle within a single growing season. Salicornia indica is adapted to high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas along shorelines."
