    "intro": "Salix obtusiuscula, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
