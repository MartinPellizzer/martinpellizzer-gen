    "intro": "Salvia doryphora, commonly known as the mountain sage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia doryphora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
