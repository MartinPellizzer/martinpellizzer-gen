    "intro": "Solidago pinnata, commonly known as the green goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Solidago pinnata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its flowering period."
