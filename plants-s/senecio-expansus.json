    "intro": "Senecio expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Senecio expansus is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is popular in xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
