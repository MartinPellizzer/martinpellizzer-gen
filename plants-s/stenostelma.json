    "intro": "Stenostelma, commonly known as the starflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Montiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, or pink. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Stenostelma species are often found growing in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Their foliage is usually succulent, which helps them conserve water in their harsh environments."
