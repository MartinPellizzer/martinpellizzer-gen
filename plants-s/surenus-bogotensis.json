    "intro": "Surenus bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 surenus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color, followed by the development of edible fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Surenus bogotensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
