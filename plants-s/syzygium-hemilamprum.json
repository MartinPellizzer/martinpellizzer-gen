    "intro": "Syzygium hemilamprum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits. The fruit's pulp is sour and contains seeds surrounded by a fibrous layer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Queensland."
