    "intro": "Stenolobium tronadora, commonly known as the Tronadora acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
