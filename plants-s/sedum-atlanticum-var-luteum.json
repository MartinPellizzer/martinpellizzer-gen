    "intro": "Sedum atlanticum var. luteum, commonly known as the Atlantic sedum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of North America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
