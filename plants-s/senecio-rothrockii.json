    "intro": "Senecio rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau in the United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Senecio rothrockii is considered a rare and endangered species."
