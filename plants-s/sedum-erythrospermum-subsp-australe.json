It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and easy to care for. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, containers, and as a ground cover."
