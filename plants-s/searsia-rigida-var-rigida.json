It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Searsia rigida var. rigida is valued for its hardiness and is used in ornamental gardening and for its potential medicinal properties."
