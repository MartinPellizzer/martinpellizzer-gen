    "intro": "Stachys hydrophila, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Stachys hydrophila is valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
