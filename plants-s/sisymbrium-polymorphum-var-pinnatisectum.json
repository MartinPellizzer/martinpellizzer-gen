    "intro": "Sisymbrium polymorphum var. pinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops if left unchecked."
