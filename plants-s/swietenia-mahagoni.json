It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers and oval, leathery fruits containing winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a pinnate venation pattern. The wood is highly valued for its durability, fine grain, and rich reddish-brown color."
