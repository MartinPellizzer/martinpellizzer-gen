    "intro": "Styphelia bracteolaris, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of less than 20 centimeters. The plant features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, often clustered at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and slightly fleshy, adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its habitat. Styphelia bracteolaris is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained conditions."
