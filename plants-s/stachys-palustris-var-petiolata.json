    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. petiolata, commonly known as swamp betony, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 feet tall, often with reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
