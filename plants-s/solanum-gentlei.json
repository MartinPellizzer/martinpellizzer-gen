    "intro": "Solanum gentlei, commonly known as the gentle nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic compounds similar to those found in other members of its family. Solanum gentlei is often found in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or forested areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
