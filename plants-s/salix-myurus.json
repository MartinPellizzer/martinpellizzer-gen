    "intro": "Salix myurus, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, riparian habitats. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil along streambanks. Salix myurus is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its use in ecological restoration projects."
