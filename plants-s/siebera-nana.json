    "intro": "Siebera nana, commonly known as the dwarf siebera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, featuring dense, compact foliage with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
