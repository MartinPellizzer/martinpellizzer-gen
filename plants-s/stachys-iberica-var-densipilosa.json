    "intro": "Stachys iberica var. densipilosa, commonly known as the dense-haired betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
