    "intro": "Solanum cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heartleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other toxic plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage."
