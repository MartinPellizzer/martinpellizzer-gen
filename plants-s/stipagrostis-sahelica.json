    "intro": "Stipagrostis sahelica, commonly known as the Sahelian grass, is a flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is a perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock. Its resilience to drought makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
