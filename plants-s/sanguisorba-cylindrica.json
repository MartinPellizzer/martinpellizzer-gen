    "intro": "Sanguisorba cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly sour taste due to its high concentration of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Sanguisorba cylindrica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
