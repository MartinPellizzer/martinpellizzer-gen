    "intro": "Steffensia opizii, commonly known as the Opiz's steffensia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Steffensia opizii is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
