    "intro": "Specklinia infinita, commonly known as the perpetual fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that exhibit a unique, spiraling growth pattern. Native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade. Its intricate foliage and slow growth make it a prized specimen among botanical enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Specklinia infinita is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
