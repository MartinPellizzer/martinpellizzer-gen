    "intro": "Simocheilus depressus, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its root system helps stabilize the sediment in its environment, contributing to water clarity. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
