    "intro": "Scleria glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along riverbanks. Scleria glomerulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
