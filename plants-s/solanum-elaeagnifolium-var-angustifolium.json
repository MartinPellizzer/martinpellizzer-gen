    "intro": "Solanum elaeagnifolium var. angustifolium, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into rounded, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
