    "intro": "Stevia phlebophylla, commonly known as the red stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. It is closely related to other stevia species and is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Stevia phlebophylla is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of natural sweeteners."
