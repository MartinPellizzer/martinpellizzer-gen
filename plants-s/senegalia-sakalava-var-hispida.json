    "intro": "Senegalia sakalava var. hispida, commonly known as the Madagascar umbrella thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its dense, spreading branches. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its yellow flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed pods that contain edible seeds. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
