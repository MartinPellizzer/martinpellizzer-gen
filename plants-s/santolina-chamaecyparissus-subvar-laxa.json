    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subvar. laxa, commonly known as the softleaf santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are slightly broader than those of the typical variety, giving it a softer appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
