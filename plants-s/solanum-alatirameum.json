    "intro": "Solanum alatirameum, commonly known as the alatirameum nightshade, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features distinctive, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its fruits are typically berries that change color as they mature, starting green and turning red or yellow. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is generally avoided for human consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
