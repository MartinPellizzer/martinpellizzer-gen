    "intro": "Sapindus senegalensis, commonly known as the African soapnut, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds, and the outer husk is used to make a natural soap due to its saponin content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across West and Central Africa."
