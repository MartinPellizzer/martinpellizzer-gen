    "intro": "Schiedeella rubrocalosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed schiedeella, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its striking red stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. Schiedeella rubrocalosa is adapted to high humidity and nutrient-poor soils, often growing in shaded understory environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
