It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary strategies for survival in extreme climates."
