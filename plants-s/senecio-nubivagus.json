    "intro": "Senecio nubivagus, commonly known as the cloud's edge or alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top, which bloom in late summer. Senecio nubivagus is adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
