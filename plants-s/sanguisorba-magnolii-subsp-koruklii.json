    "intro": "Sanguisorba magnolii subsp. koruklii, commonly known as the Koruklii sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves. The plant produces upright flowering stalks bearing clusters of small, pinkish-red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers. Its roots are fibrous and have been historically used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates."
