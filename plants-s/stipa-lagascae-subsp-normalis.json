    "intro": "Stipa lagascae subsp. normalis, commonly known as the common needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet that is both wind- and insect-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
