    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos baramensis, commonly known as the Baram Island starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Baram in the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with succulent leaves that store water, adapting to its arid native environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
