    "intro": "Sagittaria brevirostra, commonly known as the narrow-beak arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, narrow stems that support its flowering spikes. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by insects. Sagittaria brevirostra plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
