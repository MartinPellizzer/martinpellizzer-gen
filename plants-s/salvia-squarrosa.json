    "intro": "Salvia squarrosa, commonly known as the wooly mint, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia squarrosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
