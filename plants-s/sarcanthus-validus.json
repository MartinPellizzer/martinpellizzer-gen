It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Sarcanthus validus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
