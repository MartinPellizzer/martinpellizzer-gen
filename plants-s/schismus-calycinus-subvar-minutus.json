    "intro": "Schismus calycinus subvar. minutus, commonly known as the dwarf fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that grow close to the ground, forming a low, dense mat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, fluffy flowers, typically in shades of yellow or brown. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish tint, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
