    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 angulata, commonly known as the Angular Stapelia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that are often yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decay to attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant."
