    "intro": "Sassafras albidum var. molle, commonly known as southern sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elliptical, red or purple berries. Its roots and leaves contain compounds like safrole, which have been historically used in flavoring and medicinal applications. However, due to the presence of safrole, it is considered toxic in large quantities and is not recommended for consumption."
