    "intro": "Stelis fluxflorum, commonly known as the shifting bloom orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, iridescent petals that change color in response to environmental stimuli, a trait linked to its unique photosynthetic adaptations. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, with aerial roots that allow it to attach to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers, which bloom only during brief periods of high humidity, are pollinated by specialized nocturnal insects. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Stelis fluxflorum remains a subject of ongoing botanical research."
