    "intro": "Schlumbergeria roezlii, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its segmented, flattened stems that resemble leaves, which are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schlumbergeria roezlii is popular as a houseplant due to its long blooming period and ease of care."
