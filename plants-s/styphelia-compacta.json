    "intro": "Styphelia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh coastal environment. Styphelia compacta thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is a hardy plant that is well adapted to the temperate and often windy conditions of its native habitat."
