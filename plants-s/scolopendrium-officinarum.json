    "intro": "Scolopendrium officinarum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive, arching frond with a serrated, Christmas-tree-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, remaining green throughout the year, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
