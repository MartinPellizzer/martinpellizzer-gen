    "intro": "Schinus indicus, commonly known as the Indian persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces orange to red berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often used in traditional medicine. Schinus indicus thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
