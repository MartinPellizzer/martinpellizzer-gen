    "intro": "Senecio implicatus, commonly known as the wooly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, and the stems are erect and branching. Senecio implicatus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
