It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to South Africa. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Sycophila species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
