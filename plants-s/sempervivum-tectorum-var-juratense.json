    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. juratense, commonly known as the Juratense houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe. It features compact, fleshy rosettes of leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, depending on light conditions. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
