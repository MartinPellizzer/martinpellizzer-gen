    "intro": "Styrax roseus, commonly known as the rosewood styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but often unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a glossy appearance. Styrax roseus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
