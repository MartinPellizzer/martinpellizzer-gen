    "intro": "Spartina densiflora var. obtusa, commonly known as coastal cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and tufted, grass-like foliage that grows in salt marshes and tidal zones. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in brackish environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is highly adaptable and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting diverse wildlife."
