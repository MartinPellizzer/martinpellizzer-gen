    "intro": "Selago albida, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Selago albida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
