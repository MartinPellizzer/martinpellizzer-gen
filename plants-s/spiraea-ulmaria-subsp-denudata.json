It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This subspecies is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
