    "intro": "Specklinia ciliaris, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and its distinctive, ear-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually light green with a waxy texture, and they produce small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the undersides. Specklinia ciliaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
