    "intro": "Searsia arenaria, commonly known as the coastal bracken or coastal wild gooseberry, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Searsia arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
