    "intro": "Steripha reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea lettuce, is a green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that grows in dense mats on rocky substrates in marine environments. The plant has a distinct reniform (kidney-shaped) morphology, with a broad, undulating structure that allows it to float or adhere to surfaces. It contains chlorophyll a and c, enabling it to perform photosynthesis in coastal waters. Steripha reniformis plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
