    "intro": "Selenicereus hallensis, commonly known as the Hall's night bloomer, is a climbing cactus native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, segmented stems and large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces pale green or white flowers with prominent, showy petals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Selenicereus hallensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
