    "intro": "Sopubia, commonly known as the \"cup-shaped plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like inflorescence that resembles a small bowl or cup, which is formed by the tightly packed ray florets. Sopubia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. The leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appearance."
