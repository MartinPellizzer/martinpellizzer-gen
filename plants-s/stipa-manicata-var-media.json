It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery panicles that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the stems are upright and often form dense clumps. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its fine texture and seasonal interest."
