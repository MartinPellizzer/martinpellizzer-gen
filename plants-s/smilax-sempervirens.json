    "intro": "Smilax sempervirens, commonly known as catbriar or greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that are thorny and can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels. It produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Smilax sempervirens is often found in moist, shaded areas and is known for its hardy, invasive growth habit."
