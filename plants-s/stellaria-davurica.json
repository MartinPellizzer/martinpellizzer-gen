    "intro": "Stellaria davurica, commonly known as mountain starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Stellaria davurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
