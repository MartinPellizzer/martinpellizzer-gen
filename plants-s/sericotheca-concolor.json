    "intro": "Sericotheca concolor, commonly known as the silky cup lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The upper surface is covered with a thin, waxy layer that gives it a silky appearance, while the lower surface is usually darker and more granular. It grows on bark, wood, and stone in temperate and boreal forests. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
