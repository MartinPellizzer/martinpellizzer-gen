    "intro": "Spiraea hydrophila, commonly known as water spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. Spiraea hydrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
