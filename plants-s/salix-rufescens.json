    "intro": "Salix rufescens, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy on the underside, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands."
