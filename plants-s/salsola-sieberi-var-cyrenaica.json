    "intro": "Salsola sieberi var. cyrenaica, commonly known as Cyrenaican saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is native to regions of the Middle East and North Africa, where it thrives in coastal and inland saline soils. Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats."
