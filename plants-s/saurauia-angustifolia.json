    "intro": "Saurauia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saurauia, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. The small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the rainy season."
