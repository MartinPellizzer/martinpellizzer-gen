    "intro": "Saxifraga clusii var. propaginea, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features a rosette of fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
