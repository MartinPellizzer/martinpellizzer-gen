    "intro": "Salvinia cyathiformis, commonly known as the Cyathiform Salvinia, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America and is characterized by its small, ovate, and often overlapping leaves. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically located near the leaf margins. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can form dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it has been introduced."
