It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively thick and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Steiropteris polypodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
