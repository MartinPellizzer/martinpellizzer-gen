It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high salt concentrations. Its structure includes a branched stem with alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.
