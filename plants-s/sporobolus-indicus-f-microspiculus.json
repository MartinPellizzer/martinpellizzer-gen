    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus f. microspiculus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandgrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its drought-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy and disturbed soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more slender leaves compared to the typical form of Sporobolus indicus."
