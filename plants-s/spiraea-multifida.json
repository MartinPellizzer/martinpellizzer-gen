    "intro": "Spiraea multifida, commonly known as the fragrant spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Spiraea multifida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
