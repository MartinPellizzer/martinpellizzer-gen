The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. It has a tuberous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Spiranthes elata is a perennial herb that plays a role in wetland ecosystems and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil."
