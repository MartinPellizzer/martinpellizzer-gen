    "intro": "Sophora mangarevaensis, commonly known as the Mangareva tree, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Mangareva in the South Pacific. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its isolated habitat, including nutrient-poor soils and a tropical climate. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity. This species plays a significant role in the local ecosystem and holds cultural importance for the inhabitants of Mangareva."
