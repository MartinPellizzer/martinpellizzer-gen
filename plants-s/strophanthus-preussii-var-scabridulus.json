    "intro": "Strophanthus preussii var. scabridulus, commonly known as the African blood orchid, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a rough texture, and the stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
