    "intro": "Solanum hayesii, commonly known as the Hayes's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is typically found in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces small, purple or violet flowers and small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and is primarily of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
