    "intro": "Sisyrinchium antemeridianum, commonly known as the morning glory of the prairies, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, blue to violet flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Sisyrinchium antemeridianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
