    "intro": "Scrophularia valida, commonly known as the purple toadflax, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Scrophularia valida is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
