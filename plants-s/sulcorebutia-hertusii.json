It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season, typically in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a slow growth rate and minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
