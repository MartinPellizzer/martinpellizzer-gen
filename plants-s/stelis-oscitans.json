    "intro": "Stelis oscitans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Stelis oscitans is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
