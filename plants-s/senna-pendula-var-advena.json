    "intro": "Senna pendula var. advena, commonly known as the weeping senna, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are rich in nectar and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. The seeds are encased in a long, slender pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
