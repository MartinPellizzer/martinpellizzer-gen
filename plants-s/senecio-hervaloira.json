    "intro": "Senecio hervaloira, commonly known as the Hervaloira groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
