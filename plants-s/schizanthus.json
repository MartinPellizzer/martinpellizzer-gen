    "intro": "Schizanthus, commonly known as the \"poet's flower\" or \"bladderpod,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These annual or perennial plants are native to South America and are characterized by their showy, often bi-colored flowers that resemble butterflies or birds. Schizanthus species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of branches. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value. Schizanthus flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plants thrive in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
