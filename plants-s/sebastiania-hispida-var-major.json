    "intro": "Sebastiania hispida var. major, commonly known as the velvetleaf sebastiania, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
