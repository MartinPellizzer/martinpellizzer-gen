    "intro": "Stathmostelma macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered stathmostelma, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, umbellate inflorescences that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are finely divided and pinnately arranged, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
