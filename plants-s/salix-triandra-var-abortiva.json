    "intro": "Salix triandra var. abortiva, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, and it is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
