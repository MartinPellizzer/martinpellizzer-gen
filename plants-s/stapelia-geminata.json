    "intro": "Stapelia geminata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh. These flowers bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by flies and beetles attracted by the scent. Stapelia geminata is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
