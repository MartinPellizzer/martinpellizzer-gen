    "intro": "Spilanthes leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth spilanthes, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce a mild, peppery scent. Spilanthes leiocarpa is also known for its potential medicinal uses, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
