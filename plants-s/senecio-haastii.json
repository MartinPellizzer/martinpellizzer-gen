    "intro": "Senecio haastii, commonly known as the Haast's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Senecio haastii is often found in subalpine and alpine regions, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
