    "intro": "Syzygium cordatilimbum, commonly known as the heart-shaped tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible, reddish-brown fruits. The fruit's pulp is sour and acidic, similar to tamarind, and is used in various culinary applications. Syzygium cordatilimbum thrives in humid climates and is often found in forested areas or cultivated for its fruit."
