    "intro": "Sceptridium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, herbaceous plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of their branches. Sceptridium species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have a distinctive appearance with needle-like leaves and a prostrate or upright growth habit. Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Sceptridium are still used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
