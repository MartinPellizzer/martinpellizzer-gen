The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in landscaping."
