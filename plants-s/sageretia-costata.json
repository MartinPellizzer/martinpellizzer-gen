    "intro": "Sageretia costata, commonly known as the serrated sageretia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in composite heads. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Sageretia costata is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
