It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. Its leaves are elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
