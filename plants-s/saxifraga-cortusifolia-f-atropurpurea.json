    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often with a distinctive red or purple calyx. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This species is notable for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
