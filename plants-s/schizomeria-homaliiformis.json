    "intro": "Schizomeria homaliiformis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but efficient at absorbing moisture from the soil. Schizomeria homaliiformis is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
