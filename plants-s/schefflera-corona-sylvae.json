    "intro": "Schefflera corona-sylvae, commonly known as the crown of the forest, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Schefflera corona-sylvae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its foliage provides excellent shade and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
