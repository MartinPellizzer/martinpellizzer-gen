    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia f. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
