    "intro": "Solenopsis, commonly known as fire ants, is a genus of stinging ants found primarily in the Americas. These insects are characterized by their reddish-brown coloration and the presence of a distinct waist segment. Botanically, they are not plants but rather insects, so they do not have roots, stems, or leaves. However, their behavior and habitat can influence plant ecosystems. Solenopsis species are often found in soil or near vegetation, where they forage for food and establish colonies."
