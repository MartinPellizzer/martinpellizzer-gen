    "intro": "Spiranthes cernua subsp. odorata, commonly known as the fragrant twocurved spikerel. This perennial orchid is native to North America and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators like moths and beetles. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
