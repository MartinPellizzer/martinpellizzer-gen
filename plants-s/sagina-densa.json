    "intro": "Sagina densa, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Sagina densa is valued in horticulture for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
