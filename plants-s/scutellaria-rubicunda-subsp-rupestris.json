    "intro": "Scutellaria rubicunda subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock skullcup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
