    "intro": "Sedum sexangulare, commonly known as the six-angle stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are arranged in dense clusters. It is well adapted to drought conditions due to its ability to store water in its leaves and stems. Sedum sexangulare is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental appeal."
