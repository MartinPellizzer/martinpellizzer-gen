It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a thin, wiry stem with closely spaced leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and often clustered at the base of the plant.
