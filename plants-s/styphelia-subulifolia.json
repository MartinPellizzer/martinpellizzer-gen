    "intro": "Styphelia subulifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Styphelia subulifolia is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments."
