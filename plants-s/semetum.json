It is native to the wetlands of Asia, particularly India and China, where it thrives in freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom on long, erect stems. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The Semetum holds cultural and religious significance in various traditions, symbolizing purity and spiritual awakening."
