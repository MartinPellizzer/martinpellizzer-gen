    "intro": "Smilax humilis, commonly known as the low smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which are typically alternate and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Smilax humilis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable component of native ecosystems."
