    "intro": "Stenandrium droseroides subsp. droseroides, commonly known as the sticky false Venus flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments and requires consistent humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique adaptations for capturing prey make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
