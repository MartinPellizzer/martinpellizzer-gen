    "intro": "Stipa caucasica subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian needlegrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spikelets that form compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
