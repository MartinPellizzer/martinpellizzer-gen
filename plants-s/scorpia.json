    "intro": "Scorpia, commonly known as the scorpion plant, is a striking member of the genus *Cephalostigma* in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spiky, and often red or purple-hued flowers that resemble the tail of a scorpion. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is native to regions of southern Africa. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Scorpia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
