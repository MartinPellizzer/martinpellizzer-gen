    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. arborescens, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and features clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
