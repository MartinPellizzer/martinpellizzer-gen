    "intro": "Syzygium petakense, commonly known as the Petak's apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by edible, round, red fruits with a sweet and aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syzygium petakense is considered a rare and endangered species."
