    "intro": "Stachys arenaria, commonly known as sand betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to dry, sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pink to purple flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Stachys arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
