    "intro": "Statice leptophylla, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. Statice leptophylla is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
