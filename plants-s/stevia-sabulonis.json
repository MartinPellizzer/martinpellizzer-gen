    "intro": "Stevia sabulonis, commonly known as sand stevia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves contain steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners, though it is less commonly used for this purpose compared to other stevia species. Stevia sabulonis is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
