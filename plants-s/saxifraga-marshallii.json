    "intro": "Saxifraga marshallii, commonly known as Marshall's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
