    "intro": "Stipa pseudopampagrandensis, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or brown. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean highlands. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Stipa pseudopampagrandensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
