It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or dry soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
