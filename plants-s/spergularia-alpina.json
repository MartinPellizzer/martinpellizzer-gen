    "intro": "Spergularia alpina, commonly known as alpine sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Spergularia alpina is adapted to cold, dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
