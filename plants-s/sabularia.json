    "intro": "Sabularia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late summer. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where they tolerate saline and well-drained conditions. Sabularia species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Sabularia maritima, which is native to Europe and western Asia."
