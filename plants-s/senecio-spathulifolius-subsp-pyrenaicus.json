    "intro": "Senecio spathulifolius subsp. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean spoonleaf senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
