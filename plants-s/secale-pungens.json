    "intro": "Secale pungens, commonly known as the red oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
