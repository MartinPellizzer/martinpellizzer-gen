It features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
