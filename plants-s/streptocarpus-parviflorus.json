    "intro": "Streptocarpus parviflorus, commonly known as the dwarf African violet, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces violet-blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive spurred shape. Its leaves are thick, velvety, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. Streptocarpus parviflorus is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its preference for bright, indirect light and moderate watering."
