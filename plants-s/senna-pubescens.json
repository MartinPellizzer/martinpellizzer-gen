    "intro": "Senna pubescens, commonly known as the silky senna, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with soft, silky hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Senna pubescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
