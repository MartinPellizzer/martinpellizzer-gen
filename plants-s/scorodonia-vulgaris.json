    "intro": "Scorodonia vulgaris, commonly known as the common scorodoplane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Scorodonia vulgaris is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
