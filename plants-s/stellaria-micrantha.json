    "intro": "Stellaria micrantha, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Stellaria micrantha is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a common weed and a valuable plant in ecological studies."
