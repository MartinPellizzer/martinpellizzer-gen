    "intro": "Sidalcea malviflora subsp. sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparsely-leaved checkerbloom, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its sparse foliage and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
