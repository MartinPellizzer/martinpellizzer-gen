    "intro": "Saxifraga newcombei, commonly known as the Newcomb's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette pattern, and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga newcombei is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
