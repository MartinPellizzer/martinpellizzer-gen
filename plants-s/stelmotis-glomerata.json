    "intro": "Stelmotis glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family. Stelmotis glomerata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey."
