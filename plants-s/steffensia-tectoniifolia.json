    "intro": "Steffensia tectoniifolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Steffensia tectoniifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
