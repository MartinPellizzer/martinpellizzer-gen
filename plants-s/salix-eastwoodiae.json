    "intro": "Salix eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's willow, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. The plant features slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which are typical of the Salix genus. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Eastwood's willow is considered a conservation concern."
