    "intro": "Sarcochilus quinquelobatus, commonly known as the Five-lobed Sword Fern, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, sweet fragrance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
