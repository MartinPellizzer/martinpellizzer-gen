    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. Salix phylicifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
