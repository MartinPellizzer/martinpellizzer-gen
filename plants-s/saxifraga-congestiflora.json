    "intro": "Saxifraga congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the short growing season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Saxifraga congestiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local pollinators."
