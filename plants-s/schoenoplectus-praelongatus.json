    "intro": "Schoenoplectus praelongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative reproduction, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Schoenoplectus praelongatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland species."
