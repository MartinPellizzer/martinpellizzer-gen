    "intro": "Symphytum echinatum, commonly known as the spiked comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of large, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems topped with clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which allows it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. Symphytum echinatum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing properties."
