    "intro": "Sarcochilus montanus, commonly known as the mountain sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a raceme of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, often in response to rainfall. Sarcochilus montanus is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories."
