    "intro": "Selago albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high saline conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often borne on long, slender stalks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive white or pale edge that gives it its common name. Selago albomarginata is adapted to withstand harsh coastal environments, including strong winds and salt spray."
