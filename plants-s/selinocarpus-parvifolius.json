    "intro": "Selinocarpus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved selinocarpus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Selinocarpus parvifolius is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial shade."
