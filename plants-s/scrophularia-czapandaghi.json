    "intro": "Scrophularia czapandaghi, commonly known as the Czapandaghi figwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species with showy, often two-lipped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive bilabiate structure, and it produces capsule fruits containing small, dry seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
