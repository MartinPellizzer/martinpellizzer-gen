    "intro": "Spiranthes elata var. minutiflora, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, slender stem that bears the floral arrangement. The species is noted for its subtle beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
