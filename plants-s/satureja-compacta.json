It typically grows to a height of about 15-30 centimeters and features narrow, gray-green leaves with a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in cooking for their distinctive flavor, and the plant is also valued in traditional herbal medicine.
