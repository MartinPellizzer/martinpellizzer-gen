    "intro": "Salacia lehmbachii var. uregaensis, commonly known as the Uregaensis Salacia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it exhibits unique botanical characteristics. The plant is distinguished by its small, yellowish-green flowers and elongated, woody stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly pubescent underside. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
