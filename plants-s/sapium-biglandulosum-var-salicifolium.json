    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum var. salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf Chinese lantern, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, willow-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces distinctive orange-red seed pods that resemble lanterns, which split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
