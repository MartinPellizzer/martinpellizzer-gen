    "intro": "Schiedea spergulina, commonly known as the Mauna Loa rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its small, showy white or pink flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky, coastal environments. Schiedea spergulina is typically found growing on exposed cliffs and lava flows, where it adapts to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
