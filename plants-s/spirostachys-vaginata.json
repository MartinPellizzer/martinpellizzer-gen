    "intro": "Spirostachys vaginata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
