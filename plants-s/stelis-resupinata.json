    "intro": "Stelis resupinata, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a short, erect stem with clustered, small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis resupinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
