    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites, commonly known as the three-fingered saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, clustered rosettes of dark green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga tridactylites is often found in mountainous areas and is a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
