    "intro": "Salix cordata var. viridula, commonly known as the green willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its foliage remains fresh and lush throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The green willow is also valued for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
