    "intro": "Salix heterochroma var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth white willow, is a variant of the white willow species native to parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats, and it is adapted to wet environments. Its flowers are catkins, which are inconspicuous but essential for wind pollination. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their salicin content, similar to other willow species."
