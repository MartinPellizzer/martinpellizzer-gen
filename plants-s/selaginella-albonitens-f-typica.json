    "intro": "Selaginella albonitens f. typica, commonly known as the white-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
