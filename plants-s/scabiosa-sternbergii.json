    "intro": "Scabiosa sternbergii, commonly known as the desert catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Scabiosa sternbergii is often found in rocky habitats and is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
