    "intro": "Schoberia linearis, commonly known as the linear leaf spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
