    "intro": "Scilla indica, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants. Scilla indica is also valued for its ability to naturalize and bloom reliably in temperate climates."
