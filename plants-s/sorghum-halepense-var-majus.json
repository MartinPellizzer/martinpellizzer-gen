It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into oblong, ribbed seeds. Giant ragweed is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive nature and allergenic pollen."
