    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sebastiania, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal distinction is primarily based on the narrower leaf morphology compared to the standard form."
