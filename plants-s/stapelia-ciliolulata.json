    "intro": "Stapelia ciliolulata, commonly known as the \"Ciliate Stapelia,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with red markings, resembling a corpse. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its succulent appearance. Stapelia ciliolulata is prized in horticulture for its unique blooms and resilience in dry conditions."
