    "intro": "Solanum stelligerum var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features sprawling, low-growing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers."
