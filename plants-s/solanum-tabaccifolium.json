    "intro": "Solanum tabaccifolium, commonly known as the tobacco-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to South America and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble tobacco leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by livestock and humans."
