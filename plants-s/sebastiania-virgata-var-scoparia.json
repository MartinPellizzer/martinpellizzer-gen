    "intro": "Sebastiania virgata var. scoparia, commonly known as the scarlet poinsettia, is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the small, inconspicuous true flowers. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly during the holiday season due to its association with Christmas."
