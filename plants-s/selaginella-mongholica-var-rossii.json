    "intro": "Selaginella mongholica var. rossii, commonly known as the Mongolian spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry, which allows it to retain water efficiently. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments. This variant is closely related to other Selaginella species but is distinguished by specific morphological traits in its leaves and spore structures."
