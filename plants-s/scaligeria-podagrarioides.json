    "intro": "Scaligeria podagrarioides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Scaligeria podagrarioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
