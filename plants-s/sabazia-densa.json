    "intro": "Sabazia densa, commonly known as the dense sabazia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
