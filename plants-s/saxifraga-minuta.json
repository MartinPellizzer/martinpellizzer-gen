    "intro": "Saxifraga minuta, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pink flowers in early summer. Its compact size and resilience make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine displays. Saxifraga minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
