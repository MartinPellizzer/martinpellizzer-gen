    "intro": "Stelis castanea, commonly known as the chestnut orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis castanea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
