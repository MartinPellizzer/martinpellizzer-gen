    "intro": "Saxifraga cymiformis, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features compact, cushion-like growth, with small, often white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually rounded and densely packed, helping to retain heat and moisture in harsh conditions. Saxifraga cymiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand extreme environmental conditions."
