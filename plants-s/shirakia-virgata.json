    "intro": "Shirakia virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring or early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates. The leaves are typically alternate and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant properties."
