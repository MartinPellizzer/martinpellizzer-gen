    "intro": "Santalum longifolium, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its roots. Its fragrant wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and incense. The species is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and valuable resource in its natural habitat."
