    "intro": "Styrax platanifolius, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often shiny and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple, waxy berries. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. Styrax platanifolius is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
