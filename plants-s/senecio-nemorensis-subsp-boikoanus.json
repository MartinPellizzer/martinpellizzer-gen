    "intro": "Senecio nemorensis subsp. boikoanus, commonly known as the Boikoan ragged robin, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the eastern European Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, bract-like structures around its flower heads. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
