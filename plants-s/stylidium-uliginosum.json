    "intro": "Stylidium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog styliid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. The plant has a distinctive flowering structure, with a spurred petal that resembles a tiny tail, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom during the summer months. Stylidium uliginosum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction."
