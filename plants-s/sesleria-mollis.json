It features fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Sesleria mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
