    "intro": "Stenocereus pruinosus, commonly known as the silver night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Stenocereus pruinosus is also known for its slow growth and ability to survive in extreme desert climates."
