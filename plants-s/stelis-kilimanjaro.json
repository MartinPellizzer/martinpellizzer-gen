    "intro": "Stelis kilimanjaro, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing near streams or in shaded forest areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates of its habitat. Stelis kilimanjaro is an example of the rich biodiversity found in the mountainous regions of East Africa."
