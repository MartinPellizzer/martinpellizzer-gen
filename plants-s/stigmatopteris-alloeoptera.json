    "intro": "Stigmatopteris alloeoptera, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow fronds, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of black and green. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in stigmas, a unique feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. The golden fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
