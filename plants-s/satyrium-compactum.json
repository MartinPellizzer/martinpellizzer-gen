It is a small, terrestrial herb with a short stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a greenish tinge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
