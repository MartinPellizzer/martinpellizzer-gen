    "intro": "Senna pumilio, commonly known as the small senna or dwarf senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets. Senna pumilio is characterized by its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood."
