    "intro": "Styphelia sulcata, commonly known as the serrated heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in spring. Styphelia sulcata is a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
