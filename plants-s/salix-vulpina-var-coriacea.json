    "intro": "Salix vulpina var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-barked willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems that are covered with a rough, scaly bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This species is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
