    "intro": "Schmidtottia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved schmidtottia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. Schmidtottia parvifolia is often found in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to thrive in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
