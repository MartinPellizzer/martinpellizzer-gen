    "intro": "Selaginella herpocaulos var. acuminata, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, low-growing fern ally that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often narrow and linear, with a distinctive elongated spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with microspores and megaspores produced on separate cones, a characteristic feature of many spore-bearing plants. This variant is notable for its adaptations to arid conditions, including the ability to enter dormancy during dry periods."
