    "intro": "Schedonorus patulus, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Schedonorus patulus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
