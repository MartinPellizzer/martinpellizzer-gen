    "intro": "Striga bilabiata subsp. jaegeri, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with numerous branches. It is known for its ability to cause significant damage to cereal crops such as maize and sorghum. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a major agricultural pest in many regions."
