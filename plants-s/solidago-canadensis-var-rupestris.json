    "intro": "Solidago canadensis var. rupestris, commonly known as the cliff goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that often grow on rocky or exposed sites. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variety is adapted to poor soils and is often found in cliffs, streambanks, and open woods."
