    "intro": "Salix alaxensis, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender branches and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually green or reddish in color. Salix alaxensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
