    "intro": "Selaginella haenkeana, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many bryophytes and fern allies. Its reproductive structures are often clustered near the base of the plant, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella haenkeana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
