It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
