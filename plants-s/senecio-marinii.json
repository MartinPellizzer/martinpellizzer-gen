    "intro": "Senecio marinii, commonly known as the coastal groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Senecio marinii is often found in open, sunny areas along the coastlines of South Africa."
