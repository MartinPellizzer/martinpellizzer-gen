    "intro": "Sciaphila stellata, commonly known as the star-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Sciaphila stellata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
