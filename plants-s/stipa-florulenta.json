    "intro": "Stipa florulenta, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that turn a striking purple hue in the fall. The plant produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are adorned with small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks. Stipa florulenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
