    "intro": "Syngonanthus appressus var. chapadensis, commonly known as the Chapada bromeliad, is a terrestrial bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces inflorescences with small, white flowers that are typically short-lived. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
