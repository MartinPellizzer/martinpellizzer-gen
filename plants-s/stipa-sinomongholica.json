    "intro": "Stipa sinomongholica, commonly known as the Chinese needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to northern China and Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and sandy soils, often forming dense colonies. Stipa sinomongholica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
