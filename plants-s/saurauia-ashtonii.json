    "intro": "Saurauia ashtonii, commonly known as the Ashton's evergreen, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saurauia ashtonii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
