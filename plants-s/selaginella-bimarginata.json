    "intro": "Selaginella bimarginata, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive zigzag appearance due to its spirally arranged stems and leaves, which are often divided into narrow, linear segments. Its leaves are usually green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Selaginella bimarginata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is considered a primitive vascular plant with ancient evolutionary origins."
