    "intro": "Stelis gustavoi, commonly known as the Gustav's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis gustavoi is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
