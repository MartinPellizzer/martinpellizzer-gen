    "intro": "Scirpus asper var. diffusus, commonly known as the hairy club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in marshy areas, shallow water, and damp soils, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes contribute to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
