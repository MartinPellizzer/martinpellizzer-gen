It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a smooth, yellow berry that ripens in late summer. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
