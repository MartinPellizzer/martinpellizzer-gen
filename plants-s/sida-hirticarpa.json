    "intro": "Sida hirticarpa, commonly known as the hairy spurge or woolly sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Sida hirticarpa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
