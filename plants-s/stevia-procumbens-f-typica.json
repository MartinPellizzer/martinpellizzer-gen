    "intro": "[WRONG START] S-tevia procumbens f. typica, commonly known as the creeping stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Stevia procumbens f. typica is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, making it a valuable source of natural sweeteners."
