    "intro": "Sarcanthus purpuratus, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and red floral structures, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from late winter to early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, providing support for the delicate inflorescence. Sarcanthus purpuratus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
