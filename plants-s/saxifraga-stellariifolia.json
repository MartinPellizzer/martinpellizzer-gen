    "intro": "Saxifraga stellariifolia, commonly known as the star-like saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments. Saxifraga stellariifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in extreme habitats."
