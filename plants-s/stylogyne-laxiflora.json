    "intro": "Stylogyne laxiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, floating leaves that are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Stylogyne laxiflora plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
