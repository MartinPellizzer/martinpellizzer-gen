It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh environments.
