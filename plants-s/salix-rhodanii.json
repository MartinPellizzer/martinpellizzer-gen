    "intro": "Salix rhodanii, commonly known as the Jordan willow, is a shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, saline soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
