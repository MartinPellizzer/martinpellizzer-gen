    "intro": "Saussurea karlongensis, commonly known as the Karlong snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and tonic properties. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
