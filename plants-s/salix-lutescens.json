    "intro": "Salix lutescens, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and stream sides. Salix lutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian habitats. It is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
