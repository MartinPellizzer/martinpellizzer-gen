    "intro": "Salicornia fruticosa subsp. radicans, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other wetlands with high salt content. Its ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it an important component of salt-tolerant ecosystems."
