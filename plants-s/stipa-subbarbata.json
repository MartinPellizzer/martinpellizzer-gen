    "intro": "Stipa subbarbata, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes. Stipa subbarbata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
