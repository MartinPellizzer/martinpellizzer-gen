    "intro": "Siphocampylus pozuzensis, commonly known as the Pozuz\u00e9nsis siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in a cluster at the top of the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
