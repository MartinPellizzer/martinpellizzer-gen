    "intro": "Statice divaricata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces spikes of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from late summer to autumn. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy or coastal soils, making it a valuable plant in dune restoration projects. Statice divaricata is also popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
