    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny globe lichen, is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, rounded growth on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-colored thallus and the presence of small, spiny structures called pseudopores. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on limestone or sandstone. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other organisms. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
