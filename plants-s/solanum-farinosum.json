    "intro": "Solanum farinosum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
