    "intro": "Sibbaldia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its clustered growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has alternate, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
