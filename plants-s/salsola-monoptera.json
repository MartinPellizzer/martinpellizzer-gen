    "intro": "Salsola monoptera, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its prickly, leafless stems and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions. Salsola monoptera is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
