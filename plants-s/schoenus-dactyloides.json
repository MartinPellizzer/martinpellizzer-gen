    "intro": "Schoenus dactyloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Schoenus dactyloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
