It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Senecio cortusifolius is generally hardy and drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry garden environments."
