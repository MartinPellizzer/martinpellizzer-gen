It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
