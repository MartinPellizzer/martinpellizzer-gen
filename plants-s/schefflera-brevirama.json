    "intro": "Schefflera brevirama, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded crown with short, stiff stems and large, glossy, dark green leaves that are palmately lobed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes."
