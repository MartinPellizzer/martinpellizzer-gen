    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata subvar. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved sweet saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
