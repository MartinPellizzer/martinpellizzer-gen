    "intro": "Stapelia radiata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ribbed leaves that help it store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers open in the late afternoon and close at dawn, attracting pollinators like flies and beetles. Stapelia radiata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
