    "intro": "Selaginella mittenii, commonly known as the Mitten fern, is a species of spore-bearing vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. Native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) that are typically found at the base of the rosette. Selaginella mittenii is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient and adaptive species."
