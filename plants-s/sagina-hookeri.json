    "intro": "Sagina hookeri, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize harsh environments make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession. Sagina hookeri is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
