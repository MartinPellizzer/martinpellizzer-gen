    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 uplandicum, commonly known as common comfrey, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant contains high concentrations of allantoin, a compound known for its soothing properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered invasive in some regions."
