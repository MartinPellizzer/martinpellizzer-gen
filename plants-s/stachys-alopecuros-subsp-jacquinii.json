    "intro": "Stachys alopecuros subsp. jacquinii, commonly known as Jacob's weed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, square stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
