    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hankensonii, commonly known as the silver-leaf willow, is a hybrid species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Salix \u00d7 hankensonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
