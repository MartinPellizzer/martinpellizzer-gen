    "intro": "Stenophragma arenosum, commonly known as the sandstone daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss. Stenophragma arenosum is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient species."
