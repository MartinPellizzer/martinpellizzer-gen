    "intro": "Stevia perfoliata, commonly known as the leafy stevia or sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a faintly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Stevia perfoliata is often cultivated for its sweetening properties and is used in herbal teas and dietary supplements."
