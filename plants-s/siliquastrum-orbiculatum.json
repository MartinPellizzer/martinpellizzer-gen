It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by pale yellow fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a hedge. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
