It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it a resilient and hardy species."
