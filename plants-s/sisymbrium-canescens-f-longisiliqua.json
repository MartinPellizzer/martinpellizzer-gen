    "intro": "Sisymbrium canescens f. longisiliqua, commonly known as the long-stemmed hoary brookweed, is a rare and distinctive variant of the hoary brookweed species. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. Its long, slender silique fruits are a notable feature, distinguishing it from other forms of Sisymbrium. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
