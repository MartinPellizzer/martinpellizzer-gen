    "intro": "Strombocarpa brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Strombocarpa brevifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to thrive in coastal climates."
