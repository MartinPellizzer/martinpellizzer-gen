    "intro": "Sonchus italicus, commonly known as Italian sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features alternate, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, with a distinctive basal rosette structure. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a potential indicator of soil conditions."
