It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Salsola genistoides is also used in some traditional medicinal practices."
