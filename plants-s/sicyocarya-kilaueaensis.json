    "intro": "Sicyocarya kilaueaensis, commonly known as the Kilauea water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kilauea. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant has a unique reproductive strategy, producing spores rather than seeds, which allows it to thrive in specific, nutrient-rich environments. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems. However, it faces threats from habitat degradation and invasive species."
