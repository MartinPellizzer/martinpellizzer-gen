It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its branches are often used as a natural toothbrush due to their abrasive texture. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts used in traditional remedies."
