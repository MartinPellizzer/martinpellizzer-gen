    "intro": "Siphocampylus lamarckii, commonly known as the Lamarck's siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Siphocampylus lamarckii is part of the Campanulaceae family, known for its bell-shaped flowers and diverse ecological adaptations."
