    "intro": "Scirpus fuirena, commonly known as the Fuirena reed, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered spikelets, which produce wind-pollinated flowers. Scirpus fuirena plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
