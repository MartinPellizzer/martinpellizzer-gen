    "intro": "Scirpus triqueter var. foliaceus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Scirpus triqueter."
