It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red or orange berries.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
