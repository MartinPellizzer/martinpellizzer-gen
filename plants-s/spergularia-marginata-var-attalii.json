    "intro": "Spergularia marginata var. attalii, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its succulent leaves are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
