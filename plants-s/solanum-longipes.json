    "intro": "Solanum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it can grow as a shrub or small tree. Solanum longipes is also notable for its edible berries, which are sometimes used in local cuisines, though they contain solanine and should be consumed with caution."
