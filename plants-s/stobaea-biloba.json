    "intro": "Stobaea biloba, commonly known as the Biloba tree, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bilaterally symmetrical leaves, which are typically divided into two unequal lobes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, Stobaea biloba is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
