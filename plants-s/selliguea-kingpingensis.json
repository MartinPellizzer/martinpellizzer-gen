    "intro": "Selliguea kingpingensis, commonly known as the Kingpingen spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy stem and is often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Selliguea kingpingensis is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
