    "intro": "Schefflera stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera stuhlmannii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
