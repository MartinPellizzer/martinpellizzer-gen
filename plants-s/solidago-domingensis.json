    "intro": "Solidago domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as forests and clearings. Its showy, golden-yellow inflorescences bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
