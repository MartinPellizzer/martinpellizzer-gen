    "intro": "Setaria granosa, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to warm temperate and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
