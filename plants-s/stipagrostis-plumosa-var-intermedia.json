    "intro": "Stipagrostis plumosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful, wind-swaying foliage."
