    "intro": "Strobilanthopsis rogersii, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soil, often in high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
