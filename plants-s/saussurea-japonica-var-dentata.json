    "intro": "Saussurea japonica var. dentata, commonly known as Japanese yarrow or Japanese thistle, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flower heads arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its fibrous root system makes it a hardy species adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
