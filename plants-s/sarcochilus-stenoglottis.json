    "intro": "Sarcochilus stenoglottis, commonly known as the narrow-lipped rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow-lipped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in crevices or on rock faces. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the summer months. Sarcochilus stenoglottis is a rare and protected species, reflecting its limited distribution and ecological significance."
