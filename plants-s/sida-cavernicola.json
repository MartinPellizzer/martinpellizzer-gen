    "intro": "Sida cavernicola, commonly known as the cave sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as caves and rock crevices. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Sida cavernicola is notable for its unique adaptations to subterranean life, including pale flowers that may rely on specific pollinators."
