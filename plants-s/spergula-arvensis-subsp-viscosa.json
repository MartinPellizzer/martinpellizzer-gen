    "intro": "Spergula arvensis subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
