    "intro": "Scilla siberica var. gracilis, commonly known as Siberian squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its hardiness, it is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
