It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals. Native to parts of South America, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated with caution."
