    "intro": "[WRONG START] Statice plantaginea var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf statice, is a compact, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a low-growing habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value lies in its long-lasting flowers, which are often used in dried flower arrangements."
