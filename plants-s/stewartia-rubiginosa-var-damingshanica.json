    "intro": "Stewartia rubiginosa var. damingshanica, commonly known as the Daming Mountain Stewartia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that turn a striking crimson or bronze color in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by ornamental red or purple berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and unique aesthetic, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation."
