    "intro": "Symphyotrichum defoliatum, commonly known as the eastern purple coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with hairy surfaces. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species."
