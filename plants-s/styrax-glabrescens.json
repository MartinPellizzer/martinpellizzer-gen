    "intro": "Styrax glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-stalked styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. Styrax glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and floral display."
