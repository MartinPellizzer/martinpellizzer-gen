    "intro": "Salvia palifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for gardens and herbal uses. Salvia palifolia is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
