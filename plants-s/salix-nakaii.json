    "intro": "Salix nakaii, commonly known as Nakai's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are usually male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and wetlands. Salix nakaii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
