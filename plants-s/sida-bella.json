It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with hairy stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Sida bella is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry conditions. It has a fibrous root system and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
