    "intro": "Searsia, commonly known as the white stinkwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes several species that are often found in woodland and savanna habitats. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Searsia species are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season, and they produce hard, woody fruits that contain seeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and are also used in traditional medicine."
