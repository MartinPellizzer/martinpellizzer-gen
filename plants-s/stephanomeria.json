    "intro": "Stephanomeria, commonly known as the globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to western North America, particularly California and Baja California, where they thrive in dry, sunny habitats. Stephanomeria species are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pink petals. They often have hairy stems and leaves, and their foliage can be quite succulent. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
