    "intro": "Schefflera divaricata, commonly known as the variegated umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, umbrella-like crown composed of compound leaves with a striking variegation of white, yellow, and green. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera divaricata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
