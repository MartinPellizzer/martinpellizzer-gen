It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense, branching clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its name reflects its ability to capture and retain moisture in sandy substrates."
