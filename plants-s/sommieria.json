It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers. Native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is often found in maritime environments due to its tolerance for salt spray and wind. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
