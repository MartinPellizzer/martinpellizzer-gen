    "intro": "Saxifraga multiflora, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Saxifraga multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
