It is characterized by its slender, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Salvia cuspidata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
