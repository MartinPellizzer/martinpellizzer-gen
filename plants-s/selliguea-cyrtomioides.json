    "intro": "Selliguea cyrtomioides, commonly known as the rock moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in rocky, arid, or shaded environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant has a flattened, leafy structure with a dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically small, closely arranged, and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selliguea cyrtomioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other small organisms in its ecosystem."
