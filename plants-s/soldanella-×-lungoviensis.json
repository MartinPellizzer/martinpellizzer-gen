    "intro": "Soldanella \u00d7 lungoviensis, commonly known as the hybrid snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
