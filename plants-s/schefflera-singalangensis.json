    "intro": "Schefflera singalangensis, commonly known as the Singalang umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for indoor cultivation in suitable climates."
