    "intro": "Stelis campanulifera, commonly known as the bell-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. Stelis campanulifera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
