    "intro": "Sagina saginoides subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Pyrenees region. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine, or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, cliffs, and rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
