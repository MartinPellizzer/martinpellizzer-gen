    "intro": "Solidago canadensis var. salebrosa, commonly known as the stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, stiff stems that often grow in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces dense clusters of bright yellow ray florets, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
