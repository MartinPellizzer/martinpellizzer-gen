It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and have a strong, aromatic scent. Selinum rigidulum is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
