    "intro": "Selaginella orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to South America. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has distinctive, scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella orinocensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
