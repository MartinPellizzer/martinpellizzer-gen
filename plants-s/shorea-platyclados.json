    "intro": "Shorea platyclados, commonly known as the flat-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, durable wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
