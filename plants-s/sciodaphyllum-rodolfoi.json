    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum rodolfoi, commonly known as the ghost pine, is a rare and unique conifer native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its slender, twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to the humid, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many conifer species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum rodolfoi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
