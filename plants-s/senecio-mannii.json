    "intro": "Senecio mannii, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Senecio mannii produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, often blooming during the cooler months."
