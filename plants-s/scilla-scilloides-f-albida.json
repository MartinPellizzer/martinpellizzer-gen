    "intro": "Scilla scilloides f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered scilla, is a botanical variant of the scilla genus native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with the usual blue or violet hues of the species. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. The white-flowered form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and early spring blooming habit."
