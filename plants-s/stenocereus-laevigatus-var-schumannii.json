    "intro": "Stenocereus laevigatus var. schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's hedgehog cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a thick, ribbed stem covered in short, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its adaptations include a deep root system for water absorption and a waxy cuticle to minimize evaporation. This species is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
