    "intro": "Salix nakamurana subsp. yezoalpina, commonly known as Yezo alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of willow species, which contain both male and female flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. This subspecies is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it an important component of subarctic and alpine ecosystems."
