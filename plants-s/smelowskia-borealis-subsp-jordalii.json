    "intro": "Smelowskia borealis subsp. jordalii, commonly known as the northern smelowskia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
