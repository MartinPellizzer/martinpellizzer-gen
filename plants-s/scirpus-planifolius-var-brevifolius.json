    "intro": "Scirpus planifolius var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard variety. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
