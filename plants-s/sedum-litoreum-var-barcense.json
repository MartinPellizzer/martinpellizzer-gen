    "intro": "Sedum litoreum var. barcense, commonly known as the coastal stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer. It is often found in rocky coastal habitats and is a hardy plant that can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
