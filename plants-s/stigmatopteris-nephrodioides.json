    "intro": "Stigmatopteris nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney-leaf stigmatopteris, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a rugged, serrated margin. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
