    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a variant of the rowan tree characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and smaller, less prickly fruit clusters. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often growing in mountainous or forested regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
