    "intro": "Suaeda pruinosa var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with high salt content. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in coastal and desert habitats."
