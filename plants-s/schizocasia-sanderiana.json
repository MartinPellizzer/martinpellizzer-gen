    "intro": "Schizocasia sanderiana, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which attract pollinators. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss."
