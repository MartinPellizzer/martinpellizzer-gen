It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and streambanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
