It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Sloanea acutiflora produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in humid, lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
