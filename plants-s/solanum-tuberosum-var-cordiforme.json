    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. cordiforme, commonly known as the heart-shaped potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique heart-shaped tubers, which are typically smaller and more ornamental than standard potato varieties. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and produces violet flowers with yellow anthers. It is often grown as a decorative plant rather than for culinary use due to its distinct appearance. The leaves are broad and lobed, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
