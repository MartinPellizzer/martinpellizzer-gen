    "intro": "Scaphyglottis triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed lip, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a lip that is distinctly three-lobed. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
