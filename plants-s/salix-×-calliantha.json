It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water bodies for its aesthetic appeal."
