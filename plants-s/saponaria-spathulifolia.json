    "intro": "Saponaria spathulifolia, commonly known as the spoon-leaved soaproot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Saponaria spathulifolia is known for its mild sap, which has been used traditionally in herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and borders."
