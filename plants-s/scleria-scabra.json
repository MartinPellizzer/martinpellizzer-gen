    "intro": "Scleria scabra, commonly known as the rough-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Scleria scabra typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
