    "intro": "Saxifraga clusii subvar. leucanthemifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact growth habit with rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its foliage is typically a deep green, and the leaves may turn reddish in colder weather. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
