    "intro": "Suaeda maritima var. vulgaris, commonly known as sea sandmat, is a halophyte adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy shores, where it tolerates high salinity and extreme temperatures. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds via wind. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
