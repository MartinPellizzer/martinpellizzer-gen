    "intro": "Sorbus rubescens, commonly known as the red-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5\u20139 leaflets, and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns a striking red or orange."
