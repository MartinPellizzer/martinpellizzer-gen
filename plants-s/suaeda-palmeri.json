    "intro": "Suaeda palmeri, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophyte shrub native to the arid coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Suaeda palmeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
