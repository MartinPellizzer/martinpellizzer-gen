    "intro": "Solanum curtilobum, commonly known as the \"tropical nightshade,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for consumption in their raw form. Solanum curtilobum is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
