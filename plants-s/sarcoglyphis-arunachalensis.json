    "intro": "Sarcoglyphis arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or among mosses in mountainous terrain. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species faces increasing threats to its survival."
