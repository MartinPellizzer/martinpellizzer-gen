    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. rossica, commonly known as the Russian rowan, is a variant of the common rowan tree native to eastern Europe and western Siberia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, orange-red berries. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained soils, often found in forest edges and mountainous regions. Its berries are an important food source for birds and mammals, contributing to its ecological significance. The wood of this species is hard and durable, historically used for tool handles and small carvings."
