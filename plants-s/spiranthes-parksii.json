    "intro": "Spiranthes parksii, commonly known as the parksii spire orchid, is a rare and delicate species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, spiral-shaped flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
