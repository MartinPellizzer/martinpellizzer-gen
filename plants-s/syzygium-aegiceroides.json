    "intro": "Syzygium aegiceroides, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling apples. Its root system includes pneumatophores, specialized structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Syzygium aegiceroides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
