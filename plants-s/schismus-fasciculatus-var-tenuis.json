    "intro": "Schismus fasciculatus var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Cyperaceae family. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements."
