    "intro": "Salix acuminata var. androgyna, commonly known as the Androgyna willow, is a rare and unique variant of the narrow-leaved willow. It is characterized by its andromonoecious flowering structure, which means it produces both male and hermaphroditic flowers on the same plant. This botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for ecological and genetic studies. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often near streams or in wetlands. Its foliage is narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, silvery-green hue that distinguishes it from other willow species."
