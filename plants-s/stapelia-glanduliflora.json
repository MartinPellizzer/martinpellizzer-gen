    "intro": "Stapelia glanduliflora, commonly known as the sweet stinkbug plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, waxy, greenish-yellow flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia glanduliflora is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
