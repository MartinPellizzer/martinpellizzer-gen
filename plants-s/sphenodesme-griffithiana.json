    "intro": "Sphenodesme griffithiana, commonly known as the Kashmir rose, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude areas, often found in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, arid habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
