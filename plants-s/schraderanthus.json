    "intro": "Schraderanthus, commonly known as the desert beauty, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of North America. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Schraderanthus species produce showy, often yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its ecological importance in desert ecosystems. Due to their limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disruption, some species are considered rare or endangered."
