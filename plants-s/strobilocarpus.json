    "intro": "Strobilocarpus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in dry, rocky habitats. Strobilocarpus species are characterized by their erect or prostrate growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and are adapted for pollination by insects. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
