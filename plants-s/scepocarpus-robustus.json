    "intro": "Scepocarpus robustus, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a large tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Scepocarpus robustus is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
