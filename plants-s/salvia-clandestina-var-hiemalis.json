It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its use in traditional herbal remedies.
