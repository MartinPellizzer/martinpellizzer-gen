    "intro": "Stellarioides, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions. It has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Stellarioides thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
