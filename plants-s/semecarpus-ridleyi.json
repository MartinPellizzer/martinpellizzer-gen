    "intro": "Semecarpus ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Saraceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spiny, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
