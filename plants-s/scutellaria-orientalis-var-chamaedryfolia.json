    "intro": "Scutellaria orientalis var. chamaedryfolia, commonly known as the Persian shield, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
