    "intro": "Steffensia plantaginea, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Steffensia plantaginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
