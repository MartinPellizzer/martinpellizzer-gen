    "intro": "Sideroxylon microlobum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. The tree is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
