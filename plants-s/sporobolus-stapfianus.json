    "intro": "Sporobolus stapfianus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sporobolus stapfianus is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert and rocky habitats."
