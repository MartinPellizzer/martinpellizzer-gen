    "intro": "Striga ellenbergeri, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of crops like sorghum and millet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on food crops, Striga ellenbergeri is a significant concern in sub-Saharan Africa."
