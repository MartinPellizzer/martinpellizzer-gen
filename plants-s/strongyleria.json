    "intro": "Strongyleria, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plants typically grow as evergreen trees or shrubs, with simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Strongyleria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats and are also economically significant for their timber and essential oils."
