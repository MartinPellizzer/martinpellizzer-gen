    "intro": "Soldanella chrysosticta subsp. serbica, commonly known as the Serbian golden sandwort, is a rare and specialized alpine plant native to the Balkan region. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically succulent and adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
