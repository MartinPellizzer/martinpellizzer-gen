    "intro": "Sambucus glauca, commonly known as the white elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet and has alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Sambucus glauca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
