    "intro": "Saxifraga pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a small flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Saxifraga pusilla is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in crevices or on slopes where other plants struggle to grow."
