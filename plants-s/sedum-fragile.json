    "intro": "Sedum fragile, commonly known as the brittle stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its delicate stems, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to prevent damage from wind or animals."
