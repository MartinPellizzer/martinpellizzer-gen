    "intro": "Scirpus siamensis, commonly known as the Siam bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Scirpus siamensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife."
