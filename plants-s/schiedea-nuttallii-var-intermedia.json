    "intro": "Schiedea nuttallii var. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces striking inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101 Crater, where it is adapted to harsh, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a critically endangered species."
