    "intro": "Solanum hexandrum var. minax, commonly known as the Himalayan nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that mature to a deep blue or black color. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
