    "intro": "Senecio wairauensis, commonly known as the Wairau Senecio, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal or subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a compact cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
