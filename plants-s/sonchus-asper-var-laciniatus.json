    "intro": "Sonchus asper var. laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and serrated, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
