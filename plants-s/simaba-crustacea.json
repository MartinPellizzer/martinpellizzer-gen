    "intro": "Simaba crustacea, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, spreading canopy. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often forming part of mangrove ecosystems. Its small, clustered flowers are followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. The species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting biodiversity in wetland habitats."
