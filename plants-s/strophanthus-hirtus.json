    "intro": "Strophanthus hirtus, commonly known as the African milk vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Botanically, it belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and cardiac glycosides."
