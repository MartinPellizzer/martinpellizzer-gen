    "intro": "Symplocos roemeri, commonly known as the Sierra snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Symplocos roemeri is often found in moist, shaded areas of coniferous forests and is adapted to cool, mountainous climates."
