    "intro": "Stichoneuron caudatum, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous period. It was a large, tree-like lycophyte with a distinctive, elongated stem and branching structures called stichones. Its leaves were small and scale-like, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits due to its abundance and rapid growth. Fossilized remains of Stichoneuron caudatum provide important insights into the flora of ancient Earth."
