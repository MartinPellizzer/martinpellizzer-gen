    "intro": "Spiraea naxiorum, commonly known as the alpine spiraea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. Spiraea naxiorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
