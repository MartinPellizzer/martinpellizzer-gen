It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings."
