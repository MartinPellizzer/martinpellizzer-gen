    "intro": "Scirpus libanoticus, commonly known as the Lebanon bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has long, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Scirpus libanoticus plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity."
