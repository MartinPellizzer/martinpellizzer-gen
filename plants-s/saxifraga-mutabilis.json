    "intro": "Saxifraga mutabilis, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga mutabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
