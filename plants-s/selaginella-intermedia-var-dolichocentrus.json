    "intro": "Selaginella intermedia var. dolichocentrus, commonly known as the long-stemmed spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures that contribute to its ecological significance."
