    "intro": "Styphelia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier pink, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of western North America. It produces small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its cold, dry environment. Styphelia glacialis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in harsh mountain conditions where few other plants can grow."
