    "intro": "Sphaeradenia buenaventurae, commonly known as the Buenaventura's shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features leathery, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in montane forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
