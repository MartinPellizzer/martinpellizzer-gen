    "intro": "Staehelina chamaepeuce, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. It has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Staehelina chamaepeuce is well adapted to maritime climates and is often found in dune ecosystems."
