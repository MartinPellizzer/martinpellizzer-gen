    "intro": "Stigmatopteris opaca, commonly known as the opaque stigmatopteris, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green to brown in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Stigmatopteris opaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
