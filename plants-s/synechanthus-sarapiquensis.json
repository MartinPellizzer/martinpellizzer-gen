    "intro": "Synechanthus sarapiquensis, commonly known as the Sarapiqu\u00ed orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid tropical forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains poorly understood."
