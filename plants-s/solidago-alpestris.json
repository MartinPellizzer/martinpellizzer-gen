    "intro": "Solidago alpestris, commonly known as alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Solidago alpestris plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in steep, rocky areas."
