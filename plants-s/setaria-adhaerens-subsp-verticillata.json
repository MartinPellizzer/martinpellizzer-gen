It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and the arrangement of its inflorescences."
