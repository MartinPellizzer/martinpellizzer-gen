    "intro": "Stachys cinerea, commonly known as hoary betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Stachys cinerea is often found in dry, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
