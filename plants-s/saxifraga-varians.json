    "intro": "Saxifraga varians, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra habitats. Saxifraga varians is well adapted to harsh climates and is considered a hardy, resilient species."
