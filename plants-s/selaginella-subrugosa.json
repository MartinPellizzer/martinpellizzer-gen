    "intro": "Selaginella subrugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features upright, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that have a rough texture. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are arranged in cone-like clusters. Selaginella subrugosa is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
