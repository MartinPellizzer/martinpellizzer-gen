    "intro": "Seseli unicaule, commonly known as the single-stem seseli, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its single, upright stem. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, known as an umbel. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seseli unicaule is considered a vulnerable species."
