    "intro": "Scandix pontica, commonly known as the Pontic watermilfoil, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands and shallow waters of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more delicate. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Scandix pontica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and small fish."
