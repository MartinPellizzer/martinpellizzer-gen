    "intro": "Sagina crassicaulis var. litoralis, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding. This variety is often found along shorelines and in coastal dunes, playing a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
