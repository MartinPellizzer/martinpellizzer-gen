    "intro": "Spermacoce erecta, commonly known as the upright sandmat, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant with erect, branched stems that often grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Spermacoce erecta is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
