    "intro": "Salix ovatomicrophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and riverbanks. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and adaptability to harsh environments."
