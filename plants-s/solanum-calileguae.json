    "intro": "Solanum calileguae, commonly known as the Bornean nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that mature in the fall. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale green with a five-lobed corolla. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
