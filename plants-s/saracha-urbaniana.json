It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves and its ability to thrive in polluted air, making it a hardy plant for city settings. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that provides structural support. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by elongated, woody fruits. Saracha urbaniana plays a role in urban greening efforts due to its resilience and aesthetic value."
