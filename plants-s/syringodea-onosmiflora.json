    "intro": "Syringodea onosmiflora, commonly known as the fragrant wood fern, is a rare and striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of light and dark green, often with a subtle fragrance. Native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the undersides of its leaves. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, Syringodea onosmiflora is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
