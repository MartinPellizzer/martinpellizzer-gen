It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes at the ends of the stems. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Styphelia deformis thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths."
