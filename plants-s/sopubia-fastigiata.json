    "intro": "Sopubia fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff-stemmed euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features upright, woody stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Sopubia fastigiata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
