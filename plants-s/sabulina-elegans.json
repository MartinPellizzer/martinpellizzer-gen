    "intro": "Sabulina elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Sabulina elegans thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
