    "intro": "Setachna amara, commonly known as the bitter sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-sided berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Setachna amara is characterized by its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of certain alkaloids and other secondary metabolites."
