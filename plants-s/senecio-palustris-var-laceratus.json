    "intro": "Senecio palustris var. laceratus, commonly known as the marsh groundsel, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thin, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
