    "intro": "Spiranthes odorata, commonly known as the sweet piper or fragrant spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is known for its subtle fragrance, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
