    "intro": "Scorpius anglicus, commonly known as the English scorpion plant, is a unique member of the genus Scorpius within the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flowers that resemble the tail of a scorpion, hence its common name. The plant produces vivid red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. Scorpius anglicus is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with hairy, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat."
