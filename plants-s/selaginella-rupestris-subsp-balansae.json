    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris subsp. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae spikemoss, is a perennial fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of needle-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions, including drought and extreme temperatures, due to its succulent foliage. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores for reproduction. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments."
