    "intro": "Salix pedicellaris f. tenuescens, commonly known as the slender willow, is a rare and distinctive form of the pedicellaris willow. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, narrow leaves that give it a delicate appearance. This plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
