    "intro": "Serjania floribunda, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or white serjania, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and long, slender leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, hard seeds. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and potential medicinal properties."
