    "intro": "Selaginella truncata, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella truncata is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in the study of plant evolution."
