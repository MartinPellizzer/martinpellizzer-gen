    "intro": "Saussurea spicata, commonly known as the alpine helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine meadows. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Saussurea spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
