    "intro": "Schizostachyum beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's bamboo, is a tall, clumping grass native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Schizostachyum beddomei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional crafts and construction in its native habitat."
