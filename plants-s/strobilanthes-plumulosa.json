It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, velvety flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
