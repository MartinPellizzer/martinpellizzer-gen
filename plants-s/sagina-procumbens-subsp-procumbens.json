    "intro": "Sagina procumbens subsp. procumbens, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, rocky, or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
