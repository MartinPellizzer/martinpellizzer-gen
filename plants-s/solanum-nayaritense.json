    "intro": "Solanum nayaritense, commonly known as the Nayarit nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
