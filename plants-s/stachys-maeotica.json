    "intro": "Stachys maeotica, commonly known as the Pontic horseweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, producing purple to pinkish blooms that attract pollinators. Stachys maeotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
