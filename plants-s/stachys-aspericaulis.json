    "intro": "Stachys aspericaulis, commonly known as rough-haired betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Its name reflects both its rough texture and its historical use in herbal medicine."
