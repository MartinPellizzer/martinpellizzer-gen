    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon arenicola, commonly known as the coastal stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, a key feature for survival in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Stigmaphyllon arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
