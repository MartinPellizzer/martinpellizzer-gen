    "intro": "Sicklera, commonly known as the milk bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. They are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and lobed or serrated leaves. Sicklera species produce small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The genus is also noted for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
