    "intro": "Salix venusta, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive, flowing appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically wind-pollinated. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive near water sources."
