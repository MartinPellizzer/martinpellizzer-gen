    "intro": "Stapelia moschata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and its striking, odorless flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant's flowers are typically yellow to orange in color and have a strong, unpleasant smell to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia moschata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
