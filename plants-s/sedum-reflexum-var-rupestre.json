    "intro": "Sedum reflexum var. rupestre, commonly known as the Rock Sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
