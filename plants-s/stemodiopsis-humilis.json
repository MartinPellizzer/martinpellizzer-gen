    "intro": "Stemodiopsis humilis, commonly known as the low stemodia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are typically white or pale green. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
