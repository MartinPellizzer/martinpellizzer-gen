It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
