    "intro": "Solanum patellare, commonly known as the Patellare nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its botanical features include a strong, often spicy scent and the presence of alkaloids, which are characteristic of the Solanaceae family. Solanum patellare is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
