    "intro": "Solanum schultesii, commonly known as the Schultes's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, opposite leaves, and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for cultivation and is primarily found in wild habitats."
