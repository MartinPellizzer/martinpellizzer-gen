    "intro": "Styphelia stricta, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to its compact form. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a tight, upright cluster. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Styphelia stricta is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
