    "intro": "Senecio purdomii, commonly known as the Pinyon Creek groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as pinyon-juniper woodlands. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Senecio purdomii is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
