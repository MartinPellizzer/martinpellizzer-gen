    "intro": "Salix dasyclados subsp. stipularis, commonly known as the stipular willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
