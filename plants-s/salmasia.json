    "intro": "Salmasia, commonly known as the bluebell of the Canary Islands, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic soils of the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats, thriving in the unique microclimates of its native region. Salmasia has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
