    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 polonicum, commonly known as Russian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eastern Europe. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tall spikes of violet to blue flowers. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It contains mucilage and allantoin, making it useful in traditional herbal remedies. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
