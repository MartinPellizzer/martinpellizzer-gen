    "intro": "Sapium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, smooth, gray bark. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
