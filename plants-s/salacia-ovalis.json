    "intro": "Salacia ovalis, commonly known as the oval salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
