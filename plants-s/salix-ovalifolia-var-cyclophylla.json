    "intro": "Salix ovalifolia var. cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
