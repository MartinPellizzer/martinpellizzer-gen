This plant is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
