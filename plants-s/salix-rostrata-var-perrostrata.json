    "intro": "Salix rostrata var. perrostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the willow species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
