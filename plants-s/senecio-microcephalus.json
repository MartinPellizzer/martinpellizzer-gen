    "intro": "Senecio microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
