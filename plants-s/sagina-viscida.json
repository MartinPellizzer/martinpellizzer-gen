    "intro": "Sagina viscida, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has succulent, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It typically blooms with white or pink flowers in the spring and early summer. Sagina viscida is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
