    "intro": "Stelis lagarantha, commonly known as the Lagarana orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Stelis lagarantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
