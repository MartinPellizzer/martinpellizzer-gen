    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. obovata, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a variant of the silver willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-barked stems and ovate, often fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, often wet environments such as riverbanks and marshy areas. Its flowers are catkins, typical of willow species, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The leaves are typically obovate, narrowing to a pointed tip, which is a key identifying feature of this botanical variant."
