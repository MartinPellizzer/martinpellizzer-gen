    "intro": "Scorzonera acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tailed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features hairy, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and somewhat tuberous, which contributes to its hardiness in rocky and arid environments. Scorzonera acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
