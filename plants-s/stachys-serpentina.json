    "intro": "Stachys serpentina, commonly known as snake's head or creeping betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Stachys serpentina is often found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks."
