    "intro": "Selago alopecuroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often inconspicuous. It is adapted to survive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Selago alopecuroides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
