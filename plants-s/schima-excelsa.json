    "intro": "Schima excelsa, commonly known as the Chinese teak or Chinese tamarind, is a tall evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lance-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Schima excelsa is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
