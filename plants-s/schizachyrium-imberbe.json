    "intro": "Schizachyrium imberbe, commonly known as eastern gamma grass, is a native North American grass species characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woodlands and prairies, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant produces feathery, silver-gray inflorescences in late summer, which are both visually striking and important for pollinators. It is a perennial plant with a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
