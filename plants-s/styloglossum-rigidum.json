    "intro": "Styloglossum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered along the margins of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
