    "intro": "Scolosanthus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, ray florets and spiny, bract-like leaves. Scolosanthus species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They have a rosette growth form, with leaves tightly packed at the base to reduce water loss. The flowers are adapted for wind pollination, which is common in their coastal habitats."
