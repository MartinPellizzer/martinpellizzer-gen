It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically reddish-purple in color. The plant produces upright stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can receive ample sunlight."
