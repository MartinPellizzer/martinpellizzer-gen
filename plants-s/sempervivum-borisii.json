It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Sempervivum borisii is also known for its hardiness and ability to survive in cold climates."
