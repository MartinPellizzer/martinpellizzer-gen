It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or on rocky shores. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments."
