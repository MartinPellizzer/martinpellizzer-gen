It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The varietal name \"lineata\" refers to the distinctive, striped pattern on its petals. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
