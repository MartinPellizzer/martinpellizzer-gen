    "intro": "Sambucus sieboldiana var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the Japanese elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnatisect, meaning they are deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ecological and aesthetic purposes in horticulture."
