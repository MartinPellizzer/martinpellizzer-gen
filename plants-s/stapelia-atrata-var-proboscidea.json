    "intro": "Stapelia atrata var. proboscidea, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red markings, resembling the shape of a hornet's stinger. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
