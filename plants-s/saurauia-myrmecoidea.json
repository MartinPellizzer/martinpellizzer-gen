It is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are pollinated by various insects. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that attracts birds and other animals. Due to its habitat requirements, it is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments."
