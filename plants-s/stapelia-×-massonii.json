    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 massonii, commonly known as the hybrid carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and distinctive, meaty-looking flowers. The plant produces large, waxy blooms that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, mimicking decaying flesh to attract pollinators. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance. Stapelia \u00d7 massonii thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
