    "intro": "Sabal neglecta, commonly known as the Florida palmetto, is a hardy, evergreen palm native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to three feet in diameter. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is well adapted to coastal environments, making it a common sight in Florida's coastal regions. Sabal neglecta is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 100 years. Its unique appearance and resilience make it an important component of local ecosystems and a popular ornamental plant."
