It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are usually reddish-brown in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they often have a fibrous texture. Scirpus furvus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
