    "intro": "Sulcorebutia vasqueziana subsp. pedroensis, commonly known as the Pedro's stone cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It features a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray stem with a granular texture, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
