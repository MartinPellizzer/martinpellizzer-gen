    "intro": "Styphelia fasciculiflora, commonly known as the clustered greenish-leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Styphelia fasciculiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
