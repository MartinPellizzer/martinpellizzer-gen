    "intro": "Salix candida, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various insect species."
