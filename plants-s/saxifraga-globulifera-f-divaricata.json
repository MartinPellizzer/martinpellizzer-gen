    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera f. divaricata, commonly known as the branched saxifrage, is a compact, low-growing plant characterized by its dense clusters of small, rounded leaves. It produces clusters of pink to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. The plant is native to alpine regions and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, often found in mountainous areas. It is a perennial species that is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
