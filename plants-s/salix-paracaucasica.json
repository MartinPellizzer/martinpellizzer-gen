    "intro": "Salix paracaucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Salix paracaucasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
