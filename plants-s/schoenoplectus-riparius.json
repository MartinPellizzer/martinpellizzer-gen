    "intro": "Schoenoplectus riparius, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of rivers, lakes, and ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Schoenoplectus riparius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
