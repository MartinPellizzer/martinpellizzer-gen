It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. These flowers give way to berries that start green and mature to a deep red or black. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
