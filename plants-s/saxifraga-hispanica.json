    "intro": "Saxifraga hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features basal leaves that are often rosette-shaped, with a woolly texture, and produces small, white or pink flowers in spring. Its flowers are clustered in a dense inflorescence, and the plant is known for its hardiness in cooler climates. Saxifraga hispanica is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and resilience."
