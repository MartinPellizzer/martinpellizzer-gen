    "intro": "Sagenia mamillosa, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing the seeds. Sagenia mamillosa is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water retention. It is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
