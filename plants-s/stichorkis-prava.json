    "intro": "Stichorkis prava, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, often with a leathery texture. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and the fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
