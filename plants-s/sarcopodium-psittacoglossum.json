It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking red and orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment. The plant is highly sought after by botanists and collectors due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
