    "intro": "Stapelia variegata var. marmorata, commonly known as the Marble Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy, greenish-gray cuticle. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. Its leaves are usually small and alternate, contributing to its compact, bushy appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive periods of drought."
