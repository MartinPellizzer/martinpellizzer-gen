    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 erecta, commonly known as the hybrid African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed stems. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies for pollination. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stapelia hirtella and Stapelia gigantea. Stapelia \u00d7 erecta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
