    "intro": "Sambucus mexicana var. cerulea, commonly known as the blue elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue-black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers are white and arranged in panicles. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry to moist soils. The berries are edible but should be cooked before consumption due to the presence of toxic compounds in raw fruit."
