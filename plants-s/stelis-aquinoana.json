It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with a distinctive coloration pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
