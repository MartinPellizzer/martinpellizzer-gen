    "intro": "Salix vagans glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically smooth and glossy, with a silvery underside that gives the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
