    "intro": "Schefflera epiphytica, commonly known as the climbing schefflera, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of large, palm-like leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
