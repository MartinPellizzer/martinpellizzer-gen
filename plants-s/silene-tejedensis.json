    "intro": "Silene tejedensis, commonly known as the Tejed rockflower, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene tejedensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
