    "intro": "Spartina coarctata, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America. It thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, typically found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has hollow, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal areas. Spartina coarctata plays a crucial role in supporting diverse ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
