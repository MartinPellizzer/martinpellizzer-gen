    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a prostrate or ascending stem with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its flowers have five petals and are arranged in dichotomous branching patterns, giving the plant its scientific name. Stellaria dichotoma is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
