    "intro": "Striga micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and crops. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is considered a weed that can significantly reduce crop yields. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it a challenging pest to control in agricultural settings."
