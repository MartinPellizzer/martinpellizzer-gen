    "intro": "Skimmia rubella, commonly known as the winter box or red-skimmia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan and Korea. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and densely packed along its branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Skimmia rubella thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its evergreen foliage and seasonal floral display."
