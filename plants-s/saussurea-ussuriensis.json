    "intro": "Saussurea ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri giant gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
