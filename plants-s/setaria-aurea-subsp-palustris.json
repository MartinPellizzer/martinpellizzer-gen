    "intro": "Setaria aurea subsp. palustris, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, thriving in poorly drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear golden to brown bracts. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these ecosystems. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
