    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. bertiana, commonly known as the Bertina goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, ray-like flowers arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
