    "intro": "Sorema lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sorema, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. Sorema lanceolata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in its habitat."
