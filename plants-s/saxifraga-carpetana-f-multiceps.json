    "intro": "Saxifraga carpetana f. multiceps, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
