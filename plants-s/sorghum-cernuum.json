    "intro": "Sorghum cernuum, commonly known as prairie dropseed, is a warm-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to golden spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and grassland ecosystems. Sorghum cernuum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
