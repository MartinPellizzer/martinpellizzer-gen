    "intro": "Stelis remifolia, commonly known as the lacey stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare orchids."
