    "intro": "Solidago bosciana, commonly known as the white-stemmed goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a distinct white or silver vein pattern. Solidago bosciana is an important nectar source for pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
