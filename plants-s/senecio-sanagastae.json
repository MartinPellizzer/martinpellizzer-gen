    "intro": "Senecio sanagastae, commonly known as the San Agust\u00edn groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a compact, shrub-like form. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
