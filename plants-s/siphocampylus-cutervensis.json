    "intro": "Siphocampylus cutervensis, commonly known as the Cutervo mountain lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
