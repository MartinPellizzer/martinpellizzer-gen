    "intro": "Schismatoglottis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf schismatoglottis, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its compact size and unique floral structure, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
