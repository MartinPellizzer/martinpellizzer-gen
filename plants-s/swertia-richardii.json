    "intro": "Swertia richardii, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Swertia richardii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional medicinal uses in Tibetan medicine."
