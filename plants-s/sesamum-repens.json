It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated capsules that contain numerous tiny, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Sesamum repens is not widely cultivated for its seeds but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
