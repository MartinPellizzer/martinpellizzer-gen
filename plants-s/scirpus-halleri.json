    "intro": "Scirpus halleri, commonly known as the Haller's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Scirpus halleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
