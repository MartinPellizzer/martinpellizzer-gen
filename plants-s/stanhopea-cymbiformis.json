It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and moths."
