    "intro": "Salsola gemmascens subsp. kandaharica, commonly known as Kandahar sandmat, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, greenish-gray flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in dry, saline soils. It is often found in desert environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
