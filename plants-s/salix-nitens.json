    "intro": "Salix nitens, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a silvery underside. This species is often found in moist, swampy areas and is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
