It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its tubular, violet-colored flowers and hairy, elliptical leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its berries, which are yellow when mature, are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of alkaloids."
