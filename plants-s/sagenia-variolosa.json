    "intro": "Sagenia variolosa, commonly known as the variable sage, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Sagenia variolosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
