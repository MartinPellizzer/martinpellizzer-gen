    "intro": "Spergularia radicans var. capillacea, commonly known as the silky sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along shores. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that help it spread across the substrate. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, coastal conditions."
