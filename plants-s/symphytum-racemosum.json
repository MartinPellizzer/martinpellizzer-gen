    "intro": "Symphytum racemosum, commonly known as the clustered comfrey, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a thick, fleshy root system that stores nutrients, contributing to its hardiness. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
