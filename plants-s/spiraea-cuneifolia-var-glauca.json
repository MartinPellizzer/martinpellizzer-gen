    "intro": "Spiraea cuneifolia var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom, giving them a bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
