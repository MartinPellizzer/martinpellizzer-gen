    "intro": "Silphium trachopus, commonly known as the compass plant, is a tall, upright herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright leaves that are often oriented in a north-south direction, which is why it earned its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, and its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storage. Silphium trachopus is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions. It has historical significance as a valuable medicinal and food plant among Native American tribes."
