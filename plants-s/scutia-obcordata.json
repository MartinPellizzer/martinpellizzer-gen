    "intro": "Scutia obcordata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Scutia obcordata is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and water-efficient nature."
