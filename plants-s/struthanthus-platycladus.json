    "intro": "Struthanthus platycladus, commonly known as the broad-leafed struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, exhibiting adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are broad and flat, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and early summer. The species is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role."
