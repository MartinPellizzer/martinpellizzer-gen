    "intro": "Suaeda maritima var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to high salinity. Its presence often indicates stable, saline habitats with minimal soil fertility."
