    "intro": "Spartina patens var. juncea, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in brackish or saltwater marshes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting structures called salt glands. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Spartina patens var. juncea is also an important component of estuarine ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species."
