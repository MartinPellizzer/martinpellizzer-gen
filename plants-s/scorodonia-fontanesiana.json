    "intro": "Scorodonia fontanesiana, commonly known as the Fontanesian lily, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, showcasing adaptations to its arid environment. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers with a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
