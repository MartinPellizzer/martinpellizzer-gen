It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
