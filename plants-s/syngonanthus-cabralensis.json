    "intro": "Syngonanthus cabralensis, commonly known as the Cabral's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It primarily grows on the branches of native Brazilian trees, such as those in the genus *Pouteria*. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain several seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Syngonanthus cabralensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by providing food for birds and other animals."
