    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris var. tenuiculmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Scirpus species."
