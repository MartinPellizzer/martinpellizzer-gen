    "intro": "Seris amplexifolia var. vaginata, commonly known as the clasping leaf seris, is a variant of the seris plant characterized by its unique foliage structure. The leaves are typically broad and clasping, wrapping around the stem in a manner that provides structural support and enhances water retention. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
