    "intro": "Scabiosa columbaria var. radicans, commonly known as the trailing scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are often prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
