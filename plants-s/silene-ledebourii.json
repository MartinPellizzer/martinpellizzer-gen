    "intro": "[WRONG START] Silene ledeburii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a compact, mat-forming growth habit, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to minimize water loss. Silene ledeburii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
