    "intro": "Stenogyne pubicostata, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed ironwood, is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
