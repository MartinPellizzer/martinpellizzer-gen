    "intro": "Salvia praemontana, commonly known as the Mexican blue sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its foliage is often gray-green, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Salvia praemontana is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
