    "intro": "Solanum luteoalbum, commonly known as the yellow-white nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers and smooth, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to yellow or orange when mature. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
