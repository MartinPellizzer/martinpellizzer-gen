    "intro": "Sphaeropteris australis, commonly known as the Australian cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Sphaeropteris australis is typically found in coastal regions and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
