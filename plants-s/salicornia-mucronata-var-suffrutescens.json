    "intro": "Salicornia mucronata var. suffrutescens, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a succulent annual or perennial that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water and reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to further minimize desiccation. It produces tiny flowers that are typically green or reddish, and it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils."
