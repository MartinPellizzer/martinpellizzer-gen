    "intro": "Siphocampylus siberiensis, commonly known as the Siberian siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
