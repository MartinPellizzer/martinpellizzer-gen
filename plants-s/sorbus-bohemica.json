    "intro": "Sorbus bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries in autumn. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. The Bohemian whitebeam is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
