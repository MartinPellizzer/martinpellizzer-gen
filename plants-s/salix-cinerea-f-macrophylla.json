    "intro": "Salix cinerea f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved willow, is a variant of the grey willow. It is characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical Salix cinerea, which can reach lengths of up to 10 centimeters. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. Its foliage is often a soft green, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. The bark is typically pale and peeling, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
