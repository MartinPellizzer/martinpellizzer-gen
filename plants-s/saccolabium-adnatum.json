    "intro": "Saccolabium adnatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Saccolabium adnatum is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and used in traditional Indigenous practices."
