    "intro": "Symphoricarpos ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy rosehip, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible and often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Symphoricarpos ciliatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
