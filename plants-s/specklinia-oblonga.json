    "intro": "Specklinia oblonga, commonly known as the oblong staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its roots to anchor itself without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a velvety texture that helps it retain moisture. Specklinia oblonga is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
