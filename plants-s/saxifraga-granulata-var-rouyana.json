    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. rouyana, commonly known as the granular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
