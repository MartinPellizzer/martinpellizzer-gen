    "intro": "Salix clathrata, commonly known as the clustered willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, facilitating wind pollination. Its growth habit is often dense and sprawling, making it well-suited for wet or moist environments. Salix clathrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
