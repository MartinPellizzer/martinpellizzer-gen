    "intro": "Sparganium simplex var. subvaginatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr-cup, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and its distinctive, spiky, yellowish flower heads that develop into burrs. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is also a food source for various waterfowl and small mammals."
