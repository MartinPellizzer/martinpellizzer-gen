    "intro": "Saponaria calabrica var. roseoalba, commonly known as the pink soapwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is mildly soapy, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
