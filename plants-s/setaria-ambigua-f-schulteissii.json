    "intro": "Setaria ambigua f. schulteissii, commonly known as the Schulteissii foxtail, is a grass species characterized by its slender, bristly spikes that resemble the tail of a fox. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along a central axis, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form of Setaria ambigua, particularly in the structure of its inflorescence and leaf characteristics."
