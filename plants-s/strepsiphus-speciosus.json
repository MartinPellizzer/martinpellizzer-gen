It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, segmented body and specialized appendages. The plant exhibits a parasitic lifestyle, primarily infecting insects such as beetles and wasps. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, with the female developing inside the host's body. Due to its specialized biology and limited distribution, Strepsiphus speciosus is of interest to botanists and entomologists alike."
