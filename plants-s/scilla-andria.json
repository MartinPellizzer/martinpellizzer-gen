It produces clusters of blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in gardens. Scilla andria thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
