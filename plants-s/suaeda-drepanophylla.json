It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in saline and drought-prone environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
