    "intro": "Senegalia goetzei, commonly known as the goat's beard acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines, and its yellow flowers that bloom in globular clusters. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots and a high tolerance for heat and poor soil. It produces small, hard pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. Senegalia goetzei also plays a role in preventing soil erosion and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
