    "intro": "Stellaria humifusa var. marginata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its characteristic appearance. Small white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters, often in the summer months. This plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
