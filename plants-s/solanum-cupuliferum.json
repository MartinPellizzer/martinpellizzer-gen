    "intro": "Solanum cupuliferum, commonly known as the cupula tomato, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, greenish fruits resembling small tomatoes. Its fruit is edible when ripe, turning red, and is used in local cuisines for its mild, tangy flavor. Solanum cupuliferum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
