    "intro": "Statice superba, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Statice superba is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
