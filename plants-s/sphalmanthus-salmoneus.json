It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically pink to red in color, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid environments. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
