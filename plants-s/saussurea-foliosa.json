    "intro": "Saussurea foliosa, commonly known as the Kashmir saffron or the Himalayan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a unique type of saffron-like stigma, which is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in cold, arid environments. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
