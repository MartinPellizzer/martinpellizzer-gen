    "intro": "Spiranthes bangii, commonly known as the Bang's spiral orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a tight spiral of small, white to pale pink flowers. Spiranthes bangii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
