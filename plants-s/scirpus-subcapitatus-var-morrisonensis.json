It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, flooded habitats."
