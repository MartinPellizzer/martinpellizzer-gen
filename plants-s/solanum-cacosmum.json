    "intro": "Solanum cacosmum, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which are initially green and turn black when mature. These berries contain toxic compounds, particularly solanine, making them harmful to humans and animals. Its botanical features include hairy stems, alternate leaves, and a preference for disturbed soils in arid environments."
