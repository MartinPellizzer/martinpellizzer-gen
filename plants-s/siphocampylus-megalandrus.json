    "intro": "Siphocampylus megalandrus, commonly known as the giant landrail, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, feathery leaves. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent, umbrella-like inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
