    "intro": "Selago elsiae, commonly known as the silverleaf selago, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Selago elsiae is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
