It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs characterized by their aromatic, often glandular leaves. The flowers are typically small, clustered in inflorescences, and range in color from white to pink or red. Stenonia species are native to regions in Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, often growing in rocky or dry soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
