    "intro": "Sideritis tragoriganum subsp. funkiana, commonly known as the Balkan ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or violet, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
