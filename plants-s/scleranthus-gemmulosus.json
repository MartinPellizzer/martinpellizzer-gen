    "intro": "Scleranthus gemmulosus, commonly known as the gemmulate sandspur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, spiny fruits that contain seeds with a unique gemmiferous structure, allowing for vegetative propagation. The plant typically has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some areas but also plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
