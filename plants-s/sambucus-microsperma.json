    "intro": "Sambucus microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in umbels, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Its botanical characteristics include a smooth, often reddish bark and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Sambucus microsperma is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to its ecological significance in native habitats."
