    "intro": "Stenopetalum procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate petaled bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
