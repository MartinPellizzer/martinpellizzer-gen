    "intro": "Salix flexibilis, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It prefers moist soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal."
