    "intro": "Spirotheca codazziana, commonly known as the Codazzi's spirotheca, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
