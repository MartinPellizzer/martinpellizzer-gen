    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata f. compacta, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, rosette-like foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
