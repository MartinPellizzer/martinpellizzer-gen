    "intro": "Selaginella pubens, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and erect, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. Selaginella pubens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its ability to survive in diverse conditions makes it an important component of many ecosystems."
