    "intro": "Siphocampylus angustiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbel inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, aromatic leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can produce a mild, parsley-like scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
