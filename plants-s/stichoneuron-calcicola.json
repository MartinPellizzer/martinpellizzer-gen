    "intro": "Stichoneuron calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or calcareous soils. This plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor substrates. Its spore-producing structures, known as strobila, are borne on specialized branches called sporophylls. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stichoneuron calcicola is considered a relict species with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
