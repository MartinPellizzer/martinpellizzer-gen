    "intro": "Santiria teysmannii, commonly known as the Java sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is valued for its essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
