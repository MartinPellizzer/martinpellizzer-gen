It is characterized by its deep purple, almost black, skin that resembles the appearance of an egg. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and peppers. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it produces small, egg-shaped fruits. This variety is prized for its striking color and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than culinary use."
