    "intro": "Spilanthes sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toothache plant, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the genus Spilanthes, which includes several species known for their unique floral structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant is known for its strong, pungent odor and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
