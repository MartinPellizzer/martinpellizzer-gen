    "intro": "Sorbus sambucifolia var. pseudogracilis, commonly known as the slender whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It typically grows in woodland or scrub habitats, preferring well-drained soils. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
