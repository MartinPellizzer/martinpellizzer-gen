    "intro": "Salix myrtillifolia, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark of Salix myrtillifolia is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
