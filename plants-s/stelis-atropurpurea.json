    "intro": "Stelis atropurpurea, commonly known as the Purple-stemmed Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis atropurpurea is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
