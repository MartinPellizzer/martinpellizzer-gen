    "intro": "Sinapis rapa, commonly known as field mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits called siliques. Field mustard is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
