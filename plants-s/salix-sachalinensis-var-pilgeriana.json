    "intro": "Salix sachalinensis var. pilgeriana, commonly known as the Sakhalin willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-white underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found growing in moist, sandy soils near the coast. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments. This variety is closely related to other willow species but is distinguished by its unique foliage and growth habit."
