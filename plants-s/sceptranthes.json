    "intro": "Sceptranthes, commonly known as sacred candles, are herbaceous perennial plants native to the southeastern United States. They are characterized by their striking, candle-like flower spikes that range in color from white to deep pink. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Sceptranthes thrive in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
