    "intro": "Selaginella suffruticosa, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit, with whorled leaves that are often scale-like or needle-shaped. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Selaginella suffruticosa is also noted for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession."
