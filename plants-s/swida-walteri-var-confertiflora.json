    "intro": "Swida walteri var. confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered swida, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is noted for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens that favor compact, flowering shrubs. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a range of garden conditions."
