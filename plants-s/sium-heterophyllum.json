    "intro": "Sium heterophyllum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its roots are often harvested for culinary or medicinal purposes, though they can be toxic if not prepared properly. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
