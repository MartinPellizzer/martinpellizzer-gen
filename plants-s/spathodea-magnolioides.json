    "intro": "Spathodea magnolioides, commonly known as the African tulip tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble tulips, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a smooth, greyish-brown bark and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping in warm climates."
