    "intro": "Salvia clandestina var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the paleflowered sage, is a rare and lesser-known species within the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly fuzzy texture. Native to specific regions of South America, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and rare botanical specimen."
