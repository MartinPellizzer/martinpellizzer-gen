    "intro": "Scirpus deserticola, commonly known as the desert club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in saline or alkaline soils, often found in desert wetlands, salt marshes, and along the edges of ephemeral water bodies. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often covered in a thin layer of fine, white hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus deserticola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
