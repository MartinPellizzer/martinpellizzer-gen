    "intro": "Silene ismailitica, commonly known as the Ismaili silene, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Silene ismailitica is considered a rare and endangered species."
