    "intro": "Silene oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Silene oblanceolata is a perennial species that plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
