    "intro": "Sedum rosea subsp. frigidum, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its cold-hardy nature, it is often found in high-altitude habitats where temperatures can be quite low."
