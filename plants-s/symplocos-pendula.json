    "intro": "Symplocos pendula, commonly known as the weeping elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its drooping clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but generally not favored by humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. Symplocos pendula thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats."
