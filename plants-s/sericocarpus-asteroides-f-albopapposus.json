    "intro": "Sericocarpus asteroides f. albopapposus, commonly known as the white pappus sowingweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets. Its fruit is a small, dry achene with a white pappus that aids in wind dispersal. The subspecies is distinguished by its notably white pappus, which sets it apart from other forms of Sericocarpus asteroides."
