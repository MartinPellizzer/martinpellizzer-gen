    "intro": "Sapota obovata, commonly known as the Mexican sapote, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruits that are typically round or oval with a smooth, yellow or orange skin. The fruit contains a single large seed and a sweet, creamy white pulp that is rich in nutrients. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit and has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
