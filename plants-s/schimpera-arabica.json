    "intro": "Schimpera arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, white flowers followed by red berries. Its fruit contains seeds that are used to make coffee, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species. Schimpera arabica is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it resilient in its native habitat."
