    "intro": "Stipagrostis pennata, commonly known as the silky grass or silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
