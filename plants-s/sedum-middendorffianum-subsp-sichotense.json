It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular plant among gardeners in cooler regions."
