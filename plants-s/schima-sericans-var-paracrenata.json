    "intro": "Schima sericans var. paracrenata, commonly known as the glossy-leaf schima, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
