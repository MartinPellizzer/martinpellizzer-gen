    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis var. nanus, commonly known as dwarf field sowthistle, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are followed by small, spiky fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it a common weed in various habitats."
