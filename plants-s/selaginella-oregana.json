    "intro": "Selaginella oregana, commonly known as the Oregon spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella oregana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
