    "intro": "Sagittaria sanfordii, commonly known as Sanford's arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and marshes, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant features arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or extend underwater, aiding in photosynthesis. Its small, white flowers bloom above the water, contributing to its ornamental value. Sagittaria sanfordii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
