It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive red or purple markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders in horticulture."
