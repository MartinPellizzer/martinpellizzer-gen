    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 lyonensis, commonly known as the Lyon's willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Salix \u00d7 lyonensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
