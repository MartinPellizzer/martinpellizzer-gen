    "intro": "Stenia angustilabia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stenia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Stenia angustilabia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
