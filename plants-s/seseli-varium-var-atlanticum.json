    "intro": "Seseli varium var. atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic seseli, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, often in dunes or salt marshes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
