    "intro": "Serapias bergonii subsp. cilentana, commonly known as the Cilentan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Cilento region of southern Italy. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of fleshy, basal leaves and produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
