    "intro": "Stipa purpurea subsp. arenosa, commonly known as purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming compact clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically purple or pink in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy or disturbed soils."
