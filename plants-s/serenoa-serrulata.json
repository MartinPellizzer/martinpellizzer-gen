    "intro": "Serenoa serrulata, commonly known as the saw palmetto, is a small, slow-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fan-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and pine flatwoods. Its berries are an important food source for various wildlife species. The saw palmetto is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
