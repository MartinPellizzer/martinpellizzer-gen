    "intro": "Solanum fecundum, commonly known as the prolific nightshade, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically purple or white. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
