    "intro": "Salix arbuscula var. waldsteiniana, commonly known as the Waldstein's weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a matte green upper surface and a pale, fuzzy underside. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, fluffy fruits that disperse by wind. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
