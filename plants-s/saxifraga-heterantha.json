    "intro": "Saxifraga heterantha, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in areas with poor soil and extreme weather conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern. Saxifraga heterantha has a low-growing habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
