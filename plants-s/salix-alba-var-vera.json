    "intro": "Salix alba var. vera, commonly known as white willow, is a variety of the white poplar tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green in color. The plant is notable for its catkin-like flowers, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
