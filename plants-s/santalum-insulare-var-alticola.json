    "intro": "Santalum insulare var. alticola, commonly known as the highland sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional crafts and perfumery. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
