    "intro": "Strychnos pseudojollyana, commonly known as the Jollyana strangler fig, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces non-edible, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is known for its ability to grow on other plants, sometimes leading to the host's death. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not suitable for ornamental or agricultural use."
