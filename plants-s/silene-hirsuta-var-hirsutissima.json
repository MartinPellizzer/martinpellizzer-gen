It is characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall hairy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
