    "intro": "Smyrnium behboudianum, commonly known as the Persian cowbane, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its toxic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
