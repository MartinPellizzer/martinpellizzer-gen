It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 2 feet.
