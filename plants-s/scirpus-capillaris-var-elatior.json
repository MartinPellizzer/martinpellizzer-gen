    "intro": "Scirpus capillaris var. elatior, commonly known as tall marsh grass, is a variant of the common tussock sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are usually more than 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often reddish in color. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
