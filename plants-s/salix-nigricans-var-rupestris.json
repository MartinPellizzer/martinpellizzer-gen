    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in harsh, sun-exposed environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
