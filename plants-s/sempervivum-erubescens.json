    "intro": "Sempervivum erubescens, commonly known as the red-sprouting sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that turn red at the tips when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped pink or red flowers in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, including cold winters."
