    "intro": "Setaria italica subsp. pycnocoma, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a small-grained grass native to the warmer regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bristly inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop for dryland agriculture. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. It is valued for its nutritional content and is used as both a food grain and forage crop."
