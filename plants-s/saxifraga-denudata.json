    "intro": "Saxifraga denudata, commonly known as the naked-stem saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous and tundra environments. The plant features a short, often leafless stem that supports small, succulent leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Saxifraga denudata is known for its resilience to cold temperatures and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
