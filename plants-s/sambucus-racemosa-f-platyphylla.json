    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf elderberry, is a variant of the common elderberry. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant features compound leaves with flat, broad leaflets that distinguish it from other elderberry forms. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and it produces dark purple berries that are edible when ripe. The botanical characteristics of this plant make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
