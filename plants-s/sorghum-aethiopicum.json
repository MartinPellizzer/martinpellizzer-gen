It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are sturdy and fibrous. Sorghum aethiopicum is often used for forage, grain, and in traditional cuisines across sub-Saharan Africa."
