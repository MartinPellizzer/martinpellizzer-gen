    "intro": "Senna spectabilis, commonly known as the yellow senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pod-like structure, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate to flourish."
