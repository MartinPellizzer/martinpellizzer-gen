It is characterized by its yellow-orange berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
