    "intro": "Selaginella rediviva, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is renowned for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a dormant state when dry and reviving when rehydrated. This plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are spiral-shaped and closely clustered, with a leathery texture that aids in water retention. Selaginella rediviva is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a symbol of resilience."
