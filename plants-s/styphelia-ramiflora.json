    "intro": "Styphelia ramiflora, commonly known as the ramiflorous wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking contrast to its dark green foliage. Styphelia ramiflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heath environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
