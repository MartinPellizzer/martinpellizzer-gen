    "intro": "Stelis vegrandis, commonly known as the large-stemmed stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain water in its natural habitat. Stelis vegrandis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
