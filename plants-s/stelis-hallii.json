    "intro": "Stelis hallii, commonly known as the Hall's stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with several clustered leaves and small, lance-shaped foliage. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Stelis hallii is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
