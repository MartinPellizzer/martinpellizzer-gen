    "intro": "Scirpus geniculatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
