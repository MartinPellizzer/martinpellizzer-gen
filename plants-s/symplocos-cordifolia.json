    "intro": "Symplocos cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved evergreen, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, red berries that are a source of food for various wildlife. Symplocos cordifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of the flora in its native habitats."
