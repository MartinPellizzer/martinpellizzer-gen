    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush found in wetland environments. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
