    "intro": "Spiradiclis karstana, commonly known as the Karstan spiral grass, is a rare flowering plant native to the limestone-rich regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, spiraling stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale blue flowers in late spring, which are arranged in dense, whorled clusters. Spiradiclis karstana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in crevices within rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
