    "intro": "Sedum carionii, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sedum carionii is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
