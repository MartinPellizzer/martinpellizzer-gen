    "intro": "Symplocos spicata var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed evergreen holly, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves that have acute or sharp tips. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
