    "intro": "Stachys argentea, commonly known as silver hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems covered in soft, silvery-white hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and also adorned with fine, silky hairs. It produces small, pale purple to pink flowers in whorled clusters along the stem. This plant is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
