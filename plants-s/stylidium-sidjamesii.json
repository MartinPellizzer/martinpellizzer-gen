    "intro": "Stylidium sidjamesii, commonly known as the Sidjames ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with translucent, waxy petals that resemble spectral forms. Native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Stylidium sidjamesii is considered a vulnerable species."
