    "intro": "Sparganium coreanum, commonly known as the Korean bur reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late summer. Its fruits are spiky, three-lobed structures that help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Sparganium coreanum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
