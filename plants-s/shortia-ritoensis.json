    "intro": "Shortia ritoensis, commonly known as the Rito Mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
