    "intro": "Silene foetida var. herminii, commonly known as the stinking silene, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in rocky or dry habitats. Its most notable feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is produced by the flowers to attract specific pollinators. This variant is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
