    "intro": "Scilla umbellata, commonly known as the windflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its bulbs are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling it. Scilla umbellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
