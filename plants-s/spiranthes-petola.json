It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.
