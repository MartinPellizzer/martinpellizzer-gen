    "intro": "Solanum duplo-sinuatum, commonly known as the double-sinuous nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its distinctive doubly sinuous leaves, which have a unique, wavy edge. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum duplo-sinuatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
