    "intro": "Spergula nivalis, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions. Spergula nivalis is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats where it can tolerate harsh weather and limited nutrients. Its ability to survive in extreme environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
