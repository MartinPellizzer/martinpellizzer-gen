    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 schatzii, commonly known as the Schatz willow, is a hybrid species native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams and riparian zones. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces catkins in early spring. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful form and the soft yellow flowers that appear in early spring. Salix \u00d7 schatzii is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
