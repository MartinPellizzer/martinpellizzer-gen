    "intro": "Sabazia radicans, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its small, showy flowers are usually blue or violet in color, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Sabazia radicans is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes."
