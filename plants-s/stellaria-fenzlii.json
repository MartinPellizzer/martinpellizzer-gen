    "intro": "Stellaria fenzlii, commonly known as the Fenzli's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
