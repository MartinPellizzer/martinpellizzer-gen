    "intro": "Senecio tunicatus, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled spheres. Senecio tunicatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
