    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. phitu-huayacas, commonly known as the Huayacas nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a shrub characterized by its hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by berries that range in color from green to red. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
