    "intro": "Sisyrinchium paniculatum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Sisyrinchium paniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
