It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The wood is hard and heavy, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
