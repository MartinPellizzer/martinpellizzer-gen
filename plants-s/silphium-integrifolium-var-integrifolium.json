    "intro": "Silphium integrifolium var. integrifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its historical importance and ecological value, it is considered a significant species in native plant restoration efforts."
