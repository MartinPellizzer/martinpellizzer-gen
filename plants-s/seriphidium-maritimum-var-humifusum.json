    "intro": "Seriphidium maritimum var. humifusum, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and sandy or gravelly habitats. Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it a valuable plant for coastal restoration and erosion control."
