    "intro": "Sauroglossum, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plants typically have lance-shaped leaves and produce bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sauroglossum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their vibrant blooms and adaptability to various soil types. They prefer full sun to partial shade and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
