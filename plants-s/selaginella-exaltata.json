    "intro": "Selaginella exaltata, commonly known as the rose of Jericho, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance. It is a resurrection plant, capable of surviving extreme desiccation and reviving when exposed to water. Native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals along its stems, and it produces spores rather than flowers. Its unique ability to withstand drought makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening and scientific study."
