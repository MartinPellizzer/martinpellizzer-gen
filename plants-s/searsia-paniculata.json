    "intro": "Searsia paniculata, commonly known as the yellow whitetree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in panicles during the summer months. These flowers are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
