    "intro": "Securidaca pyramidalis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for construction and tool-making. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
