    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ambigua var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate weeping willow, is a low-growing, spreading shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches that hang in cascading clusters, giving it a delicate, weeping appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, elongated, and have a soft, silvery-green hue on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
