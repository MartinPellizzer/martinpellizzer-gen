    "intro": "Saxifraga glabella, commonly known as the glabrous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga glabella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
