    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fluffy white or brown flowers at the top of the stems, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomes and tubers are edible and have been historically used in traditional cuisines. The plant thrives in brackish or freshwater marshes and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones."
