It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Scrophularia suffruticans is also a host plant for certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
