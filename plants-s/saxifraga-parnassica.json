    "intro": "Saxifraga parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically rosette-shaped, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Saxifraga parnassica is adapted to harsh mountain environments and is often found in meadows and scree slopes."
