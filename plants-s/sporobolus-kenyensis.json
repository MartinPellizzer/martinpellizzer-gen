    "intro": "Sporobolus kenyensis, commonly known as Kenyan sand grass, is a perennial grass native to East Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus kenyensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
