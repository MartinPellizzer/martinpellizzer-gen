    "intro": "Solanum laxum, commonly known as the lax nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring branched stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface and serrated edges. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and often clustered in the leaf axils, giving way to the characteristic berries that mature to a dark purple color."
