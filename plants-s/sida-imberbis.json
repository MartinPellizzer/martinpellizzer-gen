    "intro": "Sida imberbis, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. Sida imberbis is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like cotton and hibiscus. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions make it both a common weed and an important plant in ecological studies."
