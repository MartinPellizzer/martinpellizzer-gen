    "intro": "Sparganium erectum subsp. mazanderanicum, commonly known as the Persian bur reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly Iran and the Caucasus. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellowish-green spikes of flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruiting structures are cylindrical, covered in spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
