    "intro": "Solanum ferocissimum var. rectispineum, commonly known as the sharp-spined nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its defensive spines and toxic compounds, it is often found in shaded, humid environments where it can thrive without being disturbed."
