It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss.
