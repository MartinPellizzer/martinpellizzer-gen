    "intro": "Spanioptilon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that grows epiphytically on the branches of trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has long, thin roots and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble a ghostly appearance. It is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and climate change. Botanists study Spanioptilon to better understand its unique adaptations and conservation needs."
