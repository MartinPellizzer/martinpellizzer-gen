    "intro": "Statice spectabilis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and other coastal habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. The flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
