    "intro": "Saxifraga nanella var. nanella, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in specialized habitats such as mountain meadows and scree slopes."
