    "intro": "Sticherus truncatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits. Sticherus truncatus is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in its native habitat."
