    "intro": "Saussurea obvallata, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that are adapted to survive in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss. Saussurea obvallata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine."
