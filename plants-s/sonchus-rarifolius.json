It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive serrated edge, while the flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months.
