    "intro": "Stylosanthes montevidensis var. longiseta, commonly known as the long-hairy stylosanthes, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It is well-adapted to sandy and disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
