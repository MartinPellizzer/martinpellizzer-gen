    "intro": "Saxifraga stenophylla subsp. komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or cushions. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude habitats."
