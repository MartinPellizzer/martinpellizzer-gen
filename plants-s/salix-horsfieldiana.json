    "intro": "Salix horsfieldiana, commonly known as Horsfield's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings."
