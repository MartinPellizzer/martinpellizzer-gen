It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It is often found in rocky or grassy areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
