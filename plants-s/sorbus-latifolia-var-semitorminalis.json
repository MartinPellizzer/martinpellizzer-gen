    "intro": "Sorbus latifolia var. semitorminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Sorbus latifolia. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native environment."
