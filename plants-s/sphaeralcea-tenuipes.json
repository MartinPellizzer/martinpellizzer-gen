    "intro": "Sphaeralcea tenuipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Sphaeralcea tenuipes is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
