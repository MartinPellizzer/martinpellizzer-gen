    "intro": "Senna exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved senna, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, pinnately compound leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Senna exigua is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
