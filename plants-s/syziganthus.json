    "intro": "Syziganthus, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, flame-colored flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Syziganthus species are often deciduous, shedding their leaves during drought periods to conserve water. These trees can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
