    "intro": "Salix subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and its bark is typically smooth and grayish. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Salix subhastata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
