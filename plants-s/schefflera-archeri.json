    "intro": "Schefflera archeri, commonly known as the silver umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera archeri is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
