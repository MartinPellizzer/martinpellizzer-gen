    "intro": "Salix tetrandra, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Salix tetrandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
