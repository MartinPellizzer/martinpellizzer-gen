    "intro": "Salvia cremenecensis, commonly known as the Cremene sage, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
