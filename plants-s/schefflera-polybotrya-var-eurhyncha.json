    "intro": "Schefflera polybotrya var. eurhyncha, commonly known as the broad-leafed schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically large, leathery, and have a waxy texture, often with a deep green color. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but not for humans. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental species."
