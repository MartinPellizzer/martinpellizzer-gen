    "intro": "Senecio subscandens, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Senecio subscandens is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
