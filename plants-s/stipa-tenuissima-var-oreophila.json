    "intro": "Stipa tenuissima var. oreophila, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clumps. The plant produces feathery, silver-green inflorescences that are both ornamental and adapted to high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
