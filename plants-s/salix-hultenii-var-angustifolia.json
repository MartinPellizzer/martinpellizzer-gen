    "intro": "Salix hultenii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid environments."
