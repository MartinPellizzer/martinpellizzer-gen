    "intro": "Stipa pennatiformis, commonly known as the feather grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that give it a distinctive feathery appearance. Stipa pennatiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful, wind-blown growth habit."
