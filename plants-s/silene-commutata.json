    "intro": "Silene commutata, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Silene commutata is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny habitats."
