The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Salvia incerta is valued in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
