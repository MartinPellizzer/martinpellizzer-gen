    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas."
