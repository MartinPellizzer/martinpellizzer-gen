    "intro": "Schedonorus montanus, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schedonorus montanus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and for its use in some horticultural applications."
