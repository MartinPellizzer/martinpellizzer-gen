    "intro": "Specklinia ephemera, commonly known as the fleeting fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant's foliage consists of slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Specklinia ephemera is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
