    "intro": "Solanum rhinozerothis, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like protrusions on its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is generally avoided as a food source and is more often recognized for its ecological role in its native habitat."
