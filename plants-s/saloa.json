    "intro": "Saloa, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow as a climbing vine or shrub, depending on environmental conditions. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Bignoniaceae family, which includes other ornamental and economically important plants."
