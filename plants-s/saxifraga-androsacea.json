    "intro": "Saxifraga androsacea, commonly known as the Androsace saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Saxifraga androsacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
