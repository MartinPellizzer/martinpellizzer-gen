    "intro": "Saxifraga peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and features fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops. Saxifraga peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
