    "intro": "Stalagmitis kydiana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, translucent stems that resemble stalagmites, giving it its unique common name. The plant produces delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to thrive in high humidity and shaded environments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Stalagmitis kydiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
