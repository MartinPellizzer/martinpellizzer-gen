    "intro": "Skimmia japonica subsp. lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchu skimmia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
