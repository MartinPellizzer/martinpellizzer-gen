    "intro": "Selaginella polystachya, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats or cushions on rocky soils or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, with specialized structures called strobila that produce spores. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded conditions. Selaginella polystachya plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
