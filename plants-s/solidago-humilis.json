    "intro": "Solidago humilis, commonly known as the dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are arranged in panicles. These flowers are rich in nectar and serve as an important food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
