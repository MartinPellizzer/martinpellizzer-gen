    "intro": "Strania, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is native to South America and is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, egg-shaped berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Strania is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with caution."
