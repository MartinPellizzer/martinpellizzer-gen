    "intro": "Sabina occidentalis, commonly known as the western juniper, is a resilient evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinct visual appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The western juniper is also valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
