    "intro": "Sisyrinchium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue-violet flowers with yellow centers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and swamps. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for wetland restoration and native garden landscapes."
