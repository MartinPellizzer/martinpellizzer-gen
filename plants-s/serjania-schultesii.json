    "intro": "Serjania schultesii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Serjania schultesii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
