    "intro": "Stipa bavioensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that form dense clumps, with fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects."
