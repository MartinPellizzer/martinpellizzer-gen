    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 schroederae var. roeblingiae, commonly known as the Roebling's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect inflorescence bearing numerous pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and endangered status, making it a subject of conservation interest. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
