    "intro": "Selaginella thurnwaldiana, commonly known as the Thurnwald's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and erect, spore-bearing cones. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat. Selaginella thurnwaldiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
