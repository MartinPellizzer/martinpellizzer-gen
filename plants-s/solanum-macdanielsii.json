It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its small, yellowish-green flowers develop into berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxicity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
