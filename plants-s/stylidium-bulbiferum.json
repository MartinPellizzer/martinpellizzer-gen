    "intro": "Stylidium bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous sun-orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble those of true orchids. The plant produces a swollen, bulb-like structure at the base, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a dark center, and they bloom during the warmer months. Stylidium bulbiferum is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
