    "intro": "Stenocline incana, commonly known as the woolly stenocline, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh climates. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
