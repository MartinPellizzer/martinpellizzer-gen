    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
