It features small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, rounded berries that are green when immature and turn red when mature. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water. The species is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important plants."
