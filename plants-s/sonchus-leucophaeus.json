    "intro": "Sonchus leucophaeus, commonly known as whiteleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with hairy stems and alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
