    "intro": "Stelis juxta, commonly known as the close-stem orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis juxta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded, humid environments."
