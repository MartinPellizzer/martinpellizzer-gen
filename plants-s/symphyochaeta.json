    "intro": "Symphyochaeta, commonly known as the \"spearhead bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a distinctive spurred structure on the petals. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Symphyochaeta species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
