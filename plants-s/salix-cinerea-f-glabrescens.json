    "intro": "Salix cinerea f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth white willow, is a variant of the white willow characterized by its reduced pubescence. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal."
