It features woody stems with spiny thorns and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch."
