It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with indirect sunlight. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of orchids."
