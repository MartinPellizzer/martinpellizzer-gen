    "intro": "Solanum venatoris, commonly known as the Hunter's Nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that transition from green to a striking deep purple as they ripen, attracting various wildlife species. Solanum venatoris is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
