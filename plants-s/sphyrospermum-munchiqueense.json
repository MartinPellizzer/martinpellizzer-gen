    "intro": "Sphyrospermum munchiqueense, commonly known as the Munchique starwood, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast to its vibrant floral displays. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
