    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's comfrey, is a hybrid plant in the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to violet flowers. Native to the United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, containing allantoin which is used in topical treatments. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
