    "intro": "Schoenobiblus coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fibrous, woody stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with low water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
