    "intro": "Salsola kali var. glabra, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has small, green, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in dry climates. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
