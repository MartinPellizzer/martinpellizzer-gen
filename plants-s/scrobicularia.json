    "intro": "Scrobicularia, commonly known as the sand hopper or sand flea, is a genus of small crustaceans rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. However, if you were referring to a plant with a similar name, please clarify. If you meant a different organism, I would be happy to provide information. For now, I must note that Scrobicularia is not a plant. I can't reply."
