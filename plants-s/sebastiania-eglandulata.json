    "intro": "Sebastiania eglandulata, commonly known as the smooth-seaberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested when they turn a bright orange-red color. These berries are rich in nutrients and are used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. Sebastiania eglandulata thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
