It is a grass species with a robust stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant exhibits tuberculate (wart-like) structures on its joints, which distinguish it from other rye varieties. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct morphology and potential agricultural applications."
