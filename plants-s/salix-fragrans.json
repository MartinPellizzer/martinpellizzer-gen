    "intro": "Salix fragrans, commonly known as sweet willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Sweet willow has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various soil types. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful appearance and fragrant foliage."
