It features gray-green, aromatic foliage that is densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscaping."
