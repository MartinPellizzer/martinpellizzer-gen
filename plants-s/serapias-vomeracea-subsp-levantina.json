    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea subsp. levantina, commonly known as the Levant sand orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or limestone areas. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with a distinctive structure that facilitates nectar access. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution."
