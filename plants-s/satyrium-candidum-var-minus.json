    "intro": "Satyrium candidum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser white-tailed moth orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives filtered sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single inflorescence with several flower buds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
