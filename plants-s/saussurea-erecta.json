    "intro": "Saussurea erecta, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
