    "intro": "Strophanthus ecaudatus, commonly known as the African milkvine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking orange-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. Its sap contains cardiotonic steroids, which have been used in traditional medicine and for arrow poison. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
