    "intro": "Saussurea, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, consists of over 300 species native to temperate and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their tall, often spiny stems and composite flower heads that resemble daisies. Many species have fibrous roots and are adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. They are valued for their medicinal properties, with some species used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Saussurea species are also popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
