    "intro": "Salix taxifolia var. sericocoma, commonly known as the silky willow, is a variant of the weeping willow that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its finely serrated, narrow leaves that are covered in a silvery down, giving it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a weeping habit that creates a cascading effect. Its catkins are notably long and pendulous, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes due to its graceful form and unique foliage."
