    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the white-tomentose rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and are covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
