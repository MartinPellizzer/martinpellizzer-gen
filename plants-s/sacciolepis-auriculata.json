    "intro": "Sacciolepis auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble ears, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it well adapted to coastal and mangrove habitats. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Sacciolepis auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in coastal ecosystem dynamics."
