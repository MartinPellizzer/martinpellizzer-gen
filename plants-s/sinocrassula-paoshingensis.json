It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring or summer. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability to arid conditions, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
