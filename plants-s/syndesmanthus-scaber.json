It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and rough, bark-like leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Syndesmanthus scaber is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
