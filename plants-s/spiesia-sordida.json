    "intro": "Spiesia sordida, commonly known as the sordid spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cyathium, which is a unique structure typical of the spurge family. Spiesia sordida is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It is known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
