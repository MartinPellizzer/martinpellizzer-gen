It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Spathandra is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in woodland environments."
