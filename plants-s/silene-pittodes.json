    "intro": "Silene pittodes, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene pittodes is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
