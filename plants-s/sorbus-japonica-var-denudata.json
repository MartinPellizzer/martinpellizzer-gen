    "intro": "Sorbus japonica var. denudata, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and turn yellow in autumn before falling. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive form and seasonal interest."
