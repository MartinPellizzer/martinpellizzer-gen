    "intro": "Statice limonium var. minor, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, delicate blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and tidal zones. Its narrow leaves are typically silver-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice limonium var. minor is widely cultivated as a ornamental plant for its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
