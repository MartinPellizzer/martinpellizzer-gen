    "intro": "Schizolobium covilleanum, commonly known as the Covilleanum umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its umbrella-shaped crown, composed of long, drooping branches that create a dense canopy. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with small, elliptical leaflets and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Schizolobium covilleanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates for its aesthetic and ecological benefits. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods and are dispersed by animals, contributing to its natural distribution."
