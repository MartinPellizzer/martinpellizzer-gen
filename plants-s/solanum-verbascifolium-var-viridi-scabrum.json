    "intro": "Solanum verbascifolium var. viridi-scabrum, commonly known as the green-scrub nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically white or green. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rough texture. This variant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
