    "intro": "Saxifraga afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, often found at high elevations. The plant features basal leaves that are often rosette-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Saxifraga afghanica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils."
