It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
