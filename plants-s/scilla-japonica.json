    "intro": "Scilla japonica, commonly known as Japanese squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Japan and parts of Korea. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue or violet star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Scilla japonica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
