    "intro": "Synchodendron ramiflorum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that bear clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Synchodendron ramiflorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking floral display."
