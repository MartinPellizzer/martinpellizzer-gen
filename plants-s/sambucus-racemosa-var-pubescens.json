    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodlands."
