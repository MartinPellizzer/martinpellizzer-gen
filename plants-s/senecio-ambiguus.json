    "intro": "Senecio ambiguus, commonly known as yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and can reach heights of up to two meters. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Senecio ambiguus is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
