    "intro": "Saguerus westerhoutii, commonly known as the Westerhout's saguaro, is a rare and unique cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble the more well-known saguaro cactus, Saguarus arizonica. The plant has a thick, ribbed structure that helps it store water, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring. It is adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal rainfall. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Saguerus westerhoutii is considered an endangered species."
