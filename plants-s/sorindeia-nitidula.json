    "intro": "Sorindeia nitidula, commonly known as the smooth sorindeia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet and features dense, dark green foliage that is smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact size and attractive appearance make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
