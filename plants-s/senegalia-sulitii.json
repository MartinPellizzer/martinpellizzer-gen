    "intro": "Senegalia sulitii, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, paired leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Senegalia sulitii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
