    "intro": "Silene jennensis, commonly known as the Jennensis campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene jennensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
