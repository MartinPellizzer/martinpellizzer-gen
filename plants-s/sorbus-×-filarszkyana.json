    "intro": "Sorbus \u00d7 filarszkyana, commonly known as the hybrid whitebeam, is a deciduous tree or shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Sorbus aucuparia (rowan) and Sorbus aria (whitebeam), resulting in a plant with distinctive ornamental features. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and the tree produces small, aggregate fruits known as sorbus. It is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and potential for wildlife habitat, though it is less commonly found in the wild compared to its parent species."
