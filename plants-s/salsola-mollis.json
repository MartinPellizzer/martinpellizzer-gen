    "intro": "Salsola mollis, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, succulent stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Salsola mollis is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soils in disturbed areas."
