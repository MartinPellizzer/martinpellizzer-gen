    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salvia officinalus f. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the dwarf common sage, is a compact variant of the common sage plant. It features shorter pedicels compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact and bushy appearance. The plant produces violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Salvia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. This cultivar is valued for its aromatic leaves and ornamental appeal, as well as its historical use in herbal medicine."
