    "intro": "Stipa iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically brown or golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa iljinii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
