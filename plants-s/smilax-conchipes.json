    "intro": "Smilax conchipes, commonly known as the prickly pear vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Smilax conchipes is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
