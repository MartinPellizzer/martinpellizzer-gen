    "intro": "Sedum quaternatum, commonly known as the four-leaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular plant among succulent enthusiasts."
