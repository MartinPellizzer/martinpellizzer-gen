    "intro": "Spiranthes picta var. grandiflora, commonly known as the showy ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. The variety is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of Spiranthes picta."
