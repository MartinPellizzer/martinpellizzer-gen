    "intro": "Solanum virgatum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or violet in color. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
