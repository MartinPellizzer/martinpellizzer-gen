It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain ecosystems."
