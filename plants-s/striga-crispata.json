    "intro": "Striga crispata, commonly known as the curly false nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed seed pods. Striga crispata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. It is considered a herbaceous perennial, though it may behave as an annual in some climates."
