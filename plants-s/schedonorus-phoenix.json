    "intro": "Schedonorus phoenix, commonly known as the desert grass or phoenix grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, a common feature among the grass family. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. Schedonorus phoenix is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
