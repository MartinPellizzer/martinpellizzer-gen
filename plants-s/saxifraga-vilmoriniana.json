    "intro": "Saxifraga vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of central Europe. It features dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
