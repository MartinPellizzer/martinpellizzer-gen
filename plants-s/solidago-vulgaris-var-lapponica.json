    "intro": "Solidago vulgaris var. lapponica, commonly known as the Arctic goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow inflorescences composed of numerous disk flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in a panicle. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is closely related to other Solidago species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit and northern distribution."
