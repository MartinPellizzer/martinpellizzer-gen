    "intro": "Salix forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in alpine meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Salix forbesii is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
