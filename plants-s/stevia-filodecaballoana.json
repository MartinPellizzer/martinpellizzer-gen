    "intro": "Stevia filodecaballoana, commonly known as the \"horseman's stevia,\" is a rare and lesser-known species within the Stevia genus. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Unlike its more commercially recognized relative, Stevia rebaudiana, Stevia filodecaballoana has not been widely cultivated for its sweet leaves, but it holds potential for future botanical research and use."
