    "intro": "Stelis ephippium, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive helmet-like shape on the column. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis ephippium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
