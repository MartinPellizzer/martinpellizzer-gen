    "intro": "Selago elata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Selago elata is well adapted to harsh environments, with features such as succulent leaves that help store water. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
