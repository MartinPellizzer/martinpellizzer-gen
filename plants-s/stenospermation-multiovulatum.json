    "intro": "Stenospermation multiovulatum, commonly known as the narrow-seed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, delicate orchid flowers with a unique coloration. The plant has a short-lived rhizome and typically grows in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it produces a single capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
