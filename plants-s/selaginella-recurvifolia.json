    "intro": "Selaginella recurvifolia, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, moss-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Selaginella recurvifolia reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of primitive vascular plants. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
