    "intro": "Sorghum trichozygum, commonly known as finger millet, is a small-grained cereal grass native to Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, finger-like spikes of small flowers that produce edible grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, dry climates, making it a staple crop in arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with the plant typically growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The grains are rich in nutrients, including calcium and iron, and are used in a variety of traditional foods."
