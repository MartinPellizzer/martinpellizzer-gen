    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. russii, commonly known as the Russian granulate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh, cold climates."
