    "intro": "Sonchus gracilis, commonly known as slender sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
