    "intro": "Saussurea mihokokawakamiana, commonly known as the Mihokokawakamiana snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
