    "intro": "Stipa formicarum, commonly known as the ant grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa formicarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
