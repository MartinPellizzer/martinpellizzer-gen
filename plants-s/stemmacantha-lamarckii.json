    "intro": "Stemmacantha lamarckii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stem and fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting central stripe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stemmacantha lamarckii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
