It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
