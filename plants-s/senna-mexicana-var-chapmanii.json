    "intro": "Senna mexicana var. chapmanii, commonly known as Mexican senna, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The seeds are encased in a pod and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
