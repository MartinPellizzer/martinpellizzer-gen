It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has a dense canopy of narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. It produces striking, spherical flower heads that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The tree is often used in landscaping for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
