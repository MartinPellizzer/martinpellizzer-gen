    "intro": "Scirpus ardea var. coreanus, commonly known as the Korean bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often emerging from dense clusters of rhizomes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to marshy environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
