    "intro": "Schedonorus benekenii, commonly known as the Beneken's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, soft foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Schedonorus benekenii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of certain ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural or ornamental purposes."
