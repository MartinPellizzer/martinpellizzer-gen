    "intro": "Sunaptea badiifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Sunaptea badiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
