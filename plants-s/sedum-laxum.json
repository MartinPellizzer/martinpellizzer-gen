It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Sedum laxum is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
