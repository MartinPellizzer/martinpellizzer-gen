    "intro": "Salix comosa, commonly known as the cottonwood or Indian weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and long, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions make it adaptable to different habitats. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
