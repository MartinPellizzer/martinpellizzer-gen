    "intro": "Scirpus hudsonianus, commonly known as Hudson's bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of pale green to brownish flowers that appear at the top of tall, slender stems. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Hudson's bulrush is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife."
