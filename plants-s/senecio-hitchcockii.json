    "intro": "Senecio hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a low-growing, sprawling habit with narrow, blue-green leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its milky sap, which is common in many members of the genus Senecio. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
