It is characterized by its weeping, cascading branches that produce long, slender leaves. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often planted near water bodies due to its ability to tolerate wet conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in landscaping and garden design."
