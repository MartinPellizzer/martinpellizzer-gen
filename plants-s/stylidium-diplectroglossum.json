    "intro": "Stylidium diplectroglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers. The plant has a unique mechanism for pollination, where the spurred petals fold inward when touched, triggering the release of pollen. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Stylidium diplectroglossum is a short-lived perennial, often found in open habitats with low rainfall."
