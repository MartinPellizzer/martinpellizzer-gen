    "intro": "Salix grandifolia var. tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering willow, is a variant of the largeleaf willow. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and flowers later in the spring compared to other willow species. This variant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams."
