    "intro": "Specklinia corniculata, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like projections on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale green, arranged in a spike-like cluster. Specklinia corniculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
