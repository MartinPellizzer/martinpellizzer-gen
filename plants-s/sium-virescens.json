    "intro": "Sium virescens, commonly known as water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, blade-like segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not as commonly consumed as other parsnip species. Sium virescens plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
