    "intro": "Styloglossum morotaiense, commonly known as the Morotai ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Morotai in Indonesia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent green leaves and its peculiar, elongated, ghost-like flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a distinctive, elongated shape that resembles a ghost or a ghostly figure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Styloglossum morotaiense is considered a vulnerable species."
