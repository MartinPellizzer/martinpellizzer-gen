It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions. The tree is also known for its latex-like sap, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural rubber substitute."
