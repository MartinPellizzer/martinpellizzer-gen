    "intro": "Scilla glandulosa f. major, commonly known as the large-flowered scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features lance-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its glandular surfaces, which give it its specific epithet \"glandulosa.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
