    "intro": "Septimetula dschallensis, commonly known as the Dschallens mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense covering of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
