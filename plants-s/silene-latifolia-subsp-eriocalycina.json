It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves and slightly different calyx structure compared to the typical S. latifolia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
