    "intro": "Stipa sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Stipa sibthorpii is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
