    "intro": "Stenospermation mathewsii var. stipitatum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated rhizomes and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces distinctive, narrow fruits that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its growth is slow and requires specific environmental conditions, such as high humidity and well-drained soil, to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
