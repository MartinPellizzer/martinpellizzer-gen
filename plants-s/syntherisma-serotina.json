    "intro": "Syntherisma serotina, commonly known as the late blooming syntherisma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Syntherimaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features small, clustered blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its blooming period occurs late in the growing season, often in late summer or early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
