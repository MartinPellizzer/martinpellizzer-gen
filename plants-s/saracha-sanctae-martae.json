    "intro": "Saracha sanctae-martae, commonly known as the sacred mountain saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the Andes. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 3,000 and 5,000 meters above sea level. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
