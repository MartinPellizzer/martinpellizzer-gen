    "intro": "Salvia lutescens f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered blue sage, is a cultivar of the Salvia genus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking pale blue to white flowers, which contrast with its gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of about 1 to 2 feet. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
