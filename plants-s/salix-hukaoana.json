    "intro": "Salix hukaoana, commonly known as the Hukaoana willow, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it relies on wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix hukaoana is considered an endangered species."
