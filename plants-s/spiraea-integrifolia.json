It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are simple, ovate, and have a smooth margin, giving the plant its common name. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and naturalized areas.
