    "intro": "Solanum nigrum inerme, commonly known as the common black nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which turn from green to black as they mature. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture and often have a glandular surface. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its toxic properties in all parts except for the ripe berries, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
