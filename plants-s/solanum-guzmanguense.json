    "intro": "Solanum guzmanguense, commonly known as the Guzm\u00e1n's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically features hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
