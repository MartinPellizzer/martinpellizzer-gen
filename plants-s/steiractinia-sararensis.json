    "intro": "Steiractinia sararensis, commonly known as the Sararensis orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered stones. Its reproductive strategy involves a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
