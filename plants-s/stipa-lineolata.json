    "intro": "Stipa lineolata, commonly known as the stripe grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that often exhibit a distinct whitish stripe along the midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
