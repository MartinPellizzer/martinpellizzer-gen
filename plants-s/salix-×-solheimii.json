    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 solheimii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is a hybrid between Salix phylicifolia and Salix viminalis, resulting in a plant with unique characteristics. The species is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Salix \u00d7 solheimii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet or marginal soils."
