    "intro": "Stylocoryna attenuata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and decaying organic matter. Stylocoryna attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
