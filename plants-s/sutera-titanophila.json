    "intro": "Sutera titanophila, commonly known as the giant sutera, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous forests or swampy areas. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture, and its stems are woody and sturdy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sutera titanophila is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
