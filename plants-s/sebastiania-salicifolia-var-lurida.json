    "intro": "Sebastiania salicifolia var. lurida, commonly known as the rough-leaved sebastiania, is a shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its unique foliage and ornamental berries make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
