    "intro": "Senecio alpestris var. sessilifolius, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
