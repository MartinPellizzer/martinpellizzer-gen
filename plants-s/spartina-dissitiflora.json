    "intro": "Spartina dissitiflora, commonly known as the coastal cordgrass, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass native to the Pacific coast of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss in salty environments. Spartina dissitiflora plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
