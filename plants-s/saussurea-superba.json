    "intro": "Saussurea superba, commonly known as the \"Red Snow Lotus,\" is a rare alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often at elevations above 4,000 meters, where it faces harsh climatic conditions. Its rhizomes are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is classified as an endangered species."
