    "intro": "Stelis maderoi, commonly known as the Mader's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis maderoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
