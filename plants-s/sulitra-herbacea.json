    "intro": "Sulitra herbacea, commonly known as the slender sulitra, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Sulitra herbacea thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
