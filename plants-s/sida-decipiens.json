It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Sida decipiens is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in swampy areas."
