    "intro": "Stipa filifolia, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Stipa filifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
