    "intro": "Sporobolus phleoides, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the southwestern regions. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy and arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in poor soil conditions. Sporobolus phleoides is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
