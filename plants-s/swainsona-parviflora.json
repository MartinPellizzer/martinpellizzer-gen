It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. Swainsona parviflora is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
