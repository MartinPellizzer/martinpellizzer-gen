    "intro": "Sairocarpus vexillocalyculatus subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate starflower, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions in South America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged around the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
