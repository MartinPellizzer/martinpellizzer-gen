    "intro": "Sonchus \u00d7 rotundilobus, commonly known as the broadleaf sowthistle, is a hybrid perennial plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
