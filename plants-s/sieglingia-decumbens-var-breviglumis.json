It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
