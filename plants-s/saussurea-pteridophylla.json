    "intro": "Saussurea pteridophylla, commonly known as the Tibetan yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other regions in Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a composite head. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
