    "intro": "Scirpus decumanus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands. The plant has broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, with the upper stems bearing spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers separated on different spikelets, a feature typical of the Cyperaceae family. Scirpus decumanus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
