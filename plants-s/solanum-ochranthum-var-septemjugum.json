    "intro": "Solanum ochranthum var. septemjugum, commonly known as the seven-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not suitable for human consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
