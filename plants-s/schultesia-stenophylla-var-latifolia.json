    "intro": "Schultesia stenophylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed schultesia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with specialized structures. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
