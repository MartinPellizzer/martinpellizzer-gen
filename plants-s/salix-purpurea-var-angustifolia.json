    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in riparian habitats."
