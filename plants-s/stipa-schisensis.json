    "intro": "Stipa schisensis, commonly known as the Chinese needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of China and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes, often forming dense clumps. Stipa schisensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
