    "intro": "Selaginella plumosa var. flagellifera, commonly known as the whiplash spikemoss, is a rare and ancient fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that are spirally arranged along its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and evolutionary significance make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
