    "intro": "Sorghum sorghum, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a tall, sturdy plant that can grow up to 3 to 6 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, hard grains that are typically red, white, or yellow, depending on the variety. Sorghum is a drought-resistant crop with a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important staple food and forage crop in many parts of the world."
