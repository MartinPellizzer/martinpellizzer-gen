    "intro": "Selinopsis montana, commonly known as the mountain angel's wings, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Selinopsis montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
