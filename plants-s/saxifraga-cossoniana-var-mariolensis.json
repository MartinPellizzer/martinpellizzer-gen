    "intro": "Saxifraga cossoniana var. mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensian saxifrage, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees region of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
