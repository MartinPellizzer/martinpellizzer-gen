    "intro": "Solidago harperi, commonly known as Harpers goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in panicles. Harpers goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
