    "intro": "Saxifraga daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet, China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
