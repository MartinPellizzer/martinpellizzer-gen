    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum f. majus, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, upright leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value."
