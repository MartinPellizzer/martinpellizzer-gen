It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white, apple-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
