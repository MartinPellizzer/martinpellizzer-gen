    "intro": "Silene fissicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many showy, herbaceous plants. The plant produces delicate pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene fissicalyx is typically found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun."
