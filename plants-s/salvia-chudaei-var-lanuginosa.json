    "intro": "Salvia chudaei var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
