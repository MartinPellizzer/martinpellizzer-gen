    "intro": "Sageretia theezans, commonly known as the Chinese sand thorn, is a shrub native to China and is part of the Rhamnaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and thorny branches, which are typical of many species in its family. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are small, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain seeds. Sageretia theezans is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical uses are not as well-documented as those of other plants in the Rhamnaceae family."
