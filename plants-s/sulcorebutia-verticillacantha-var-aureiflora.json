    "intro": "Sulcorebutia verticillacantha var. aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered sun rose, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is an ideal choice for container gardening."
