    "intro": "Sesbania arborescens, commonly known as the tree cotton or silk tree, is a tropical leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its rapid growth, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters, and its striking clusters of fluffy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation. Sesbania arborescens is often used in agroforestry and as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value and ability to improve soil fertility."
