It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant has thin, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Stellaria gonomischa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
