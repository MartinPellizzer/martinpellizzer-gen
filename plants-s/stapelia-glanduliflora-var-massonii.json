    "intro": "Stapelia glanduliflora var. massonii, commonly known as the Masson's stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually small and modified into spines, reducing water loss. This species is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
