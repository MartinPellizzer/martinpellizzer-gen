    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia subsp. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a silvery-white underside, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardiness in cooler climates."
