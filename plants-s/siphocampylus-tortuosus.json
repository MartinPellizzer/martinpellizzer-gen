    "intro": "Siphocampylus tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted leaf siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. Its small white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Siphocampylus tortuosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
