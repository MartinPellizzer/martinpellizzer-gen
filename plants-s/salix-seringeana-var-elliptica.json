    "intro": "Salix seringeana var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20138 cm long. The leaves are usually green on the upper surface and pale or whitish underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This species thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
