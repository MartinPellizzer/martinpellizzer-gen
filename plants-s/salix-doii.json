    "intro": "Salix doii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a species of willow native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in mountainous areas with cold climates. The plant has slender branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are catkin-like, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Salix doii is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
