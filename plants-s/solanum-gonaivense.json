    "intro": "Solanum gonaivense, commonly known as the Haitian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Haiti. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that open at night, and its berries turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
