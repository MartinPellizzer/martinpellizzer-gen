    "intro": "Schoenoplectus juncoides subsp. triangulatus, commonly known as the triangular bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. It is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from other similar species."
