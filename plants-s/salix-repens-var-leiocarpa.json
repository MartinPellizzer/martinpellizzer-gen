    "intro": "Salix repens var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky willow or creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with a fine, silky white pubescence. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers on separate plants. This variety is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wet meadows."
