    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii var. kilimanjari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro groundsels, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Kilimanjaro. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
