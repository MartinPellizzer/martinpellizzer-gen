    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste munaensis, commonly known as the Muna Island fern, is a rare plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
