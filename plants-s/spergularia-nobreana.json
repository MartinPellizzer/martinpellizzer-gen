    "intro": "Spergularia nobreana, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Spergularia nobreana plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is an important part of the coastal flora."
