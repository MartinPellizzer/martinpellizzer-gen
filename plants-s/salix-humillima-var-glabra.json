    "intro": "Salix humillima var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
