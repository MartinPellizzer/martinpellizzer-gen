    "intro": "Sempervivum webbianum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Sempervivum webbianum is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
