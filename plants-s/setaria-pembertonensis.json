    "intro": "Setaria pembertonensis, commonly known as the Pemberton panicgrass, is a species of grass native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
