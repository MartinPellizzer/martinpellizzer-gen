    "intro": "Saccharum tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed cane, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and long, narrow leaves with prominent veins. The plant is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments. Its flowering spikes produce small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. Saccharum tridentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
