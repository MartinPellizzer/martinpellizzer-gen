    "intro": "Sagina maxima var. littorea, commonly known as sea saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters near the base of the plant. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
