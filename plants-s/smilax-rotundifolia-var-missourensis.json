    "intro": "Smilax rotundifolia var. missourensis, commonly known as the Missourian smilax, is a variant of the common smilax, characterized by its thick, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Alabama and Mississippi. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with robust stems and persistent foliage."
