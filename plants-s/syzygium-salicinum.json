It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and eastern parts. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, yellow or orange berries. The fruit is often consumed by native animals and is also used in traditional Indigenous Australian practices."
