    "intro": "Scurrula chingii var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan scurrula, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive foliose thallus with a leathery texture. The plant exhibits a complex structure with lobate and rhizoidal branches, often forming dense mats on rocky substrates. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
