    "intro": "Stangeria, commonly known as the African cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Stangeria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
