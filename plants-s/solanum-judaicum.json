It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, bright orange berries that are edible but often considered ornamental rather than culinary. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a slightly hairy texture. Solanum judaicum is often cultivated for its vibrant fruits and ornamental value in gardens."
