    "intro": "Sedum villosum, commonly known as wooly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in soft, white hairs, which give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
