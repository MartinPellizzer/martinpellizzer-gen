    "intro": "Schoepfia cupulata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. Schoepfia cupulata is also known for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus."
