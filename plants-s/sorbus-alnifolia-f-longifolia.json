    "intro": "Sorbus alnifolia f. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf whitebeam, is a botanical variant of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by edible berries in autumn. This form is notable for its distinctive foliage and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
