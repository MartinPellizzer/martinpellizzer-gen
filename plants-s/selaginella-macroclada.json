    "intro": "Selaginella macroclada, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Selaginella macroclada reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
