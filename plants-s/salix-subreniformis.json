    "intro": "Salix subreniformis, commonly known as the round-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often rounded at the base. The plant typically grows along streams and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its catkins are a distinguishing feature, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Salix subreniformis plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
