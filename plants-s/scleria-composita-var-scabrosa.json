It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their fibrous rhizomes and spike-like inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its flowering stems bear small, three-lobed flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Scleria composita var. scabrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
