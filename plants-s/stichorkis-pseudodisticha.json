It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and coastal areas."
