Native to the Philippines, particularly the province of Agusan, it is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are usually glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture. Schefflera agusanensis produces small, white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, making it an attractive ornamental plant."
