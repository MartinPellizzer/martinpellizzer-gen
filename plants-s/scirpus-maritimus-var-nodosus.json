    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. nodosus, commonly known as the nodding bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically nodding or drooping, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
