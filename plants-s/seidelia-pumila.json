    "intro": "Seidelia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf seidelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats to protect itself from harsh weather conditions. Seidelia pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an indicator species for tundra ecosystems."
