    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sandweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has alternate, hairy leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This subspecies is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
