    "intro": "Sedum purpurascens var. luteolum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to drought conditions and extreme temperatures."
