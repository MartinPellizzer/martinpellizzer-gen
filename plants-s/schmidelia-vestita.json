    "intro": "Schmidelia vestita, commonly known as the white sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Schmidelia vestita thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh, arid conditions."
