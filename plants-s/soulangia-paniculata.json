    "intro": "Soulangia paniculata, commonly known as the white tamarind tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, elongated fruits that resemble tamarinds. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fibrous, pulp-like material. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
