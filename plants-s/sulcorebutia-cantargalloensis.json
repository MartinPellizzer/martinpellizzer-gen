    "intro": "Sulcorebutia cantargalloensis, commonly known as the Cantagallo sun rose, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Bolivia. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
