    "intro": "Salix cyclostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a species of shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
