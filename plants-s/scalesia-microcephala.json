    "intro": "Scalesia microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf scaleia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Its small stature and dense foliage make it an important component of the local flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
