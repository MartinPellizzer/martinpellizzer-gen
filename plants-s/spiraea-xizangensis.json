    "intro": "Spiraea xizangensis, commonly known as the Tibet spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas in China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fluffy pink or white inflorescences that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. Spiraea xizangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
