    "intro": "Solulus mimosodes, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a hand, and its clusters of bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a member of the Leguminosae (Fabaceae) family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing species. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in full sun make it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates. Solulus mimosodes is also noted for its fast growth rate and ability to provide dense shade."
