    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. melanoceras, commonly known as the black nightshade potato, is a variant of the common potato with distinctive dark purple to black skin and flesh. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant produces tubers that are typically smaller than standard potatoes but have a rich, earthy flavor. It is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its edible tubers. However, it contains solanine, making it potentially toxic if not prepared properly."
