    "intro": "Scleria bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its grass-like leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. Scleria bulbifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
