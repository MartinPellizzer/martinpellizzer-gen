    "intro": "Salix myricifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, and is often used in riparian restoration projects. The bark and leaves have been historically used by Indigenous peoples for various medicinal and practical purposes."
