    "intro": "Stathmostelma frommii, commonly known as the Yunnan bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forests or rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stathmostelma frommii is considered a vulnerable species."
