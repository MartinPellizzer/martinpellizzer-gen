    "intro": "Spilotantha alvaroi, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Spilotantha alvaroi plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
