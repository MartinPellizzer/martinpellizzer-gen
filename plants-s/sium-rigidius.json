    "intro": "Sium rigidius, commonly known as water parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of North America. It features a thick, fleshy root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Sium rigidius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
