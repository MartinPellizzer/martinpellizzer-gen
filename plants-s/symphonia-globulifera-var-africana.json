    "intro": "Symphonia globulifera var. africana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a sturdy, almost impenetrable bark that gives it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardiness and slow growth, it is valued for its timber and ecological importance in its native habitat."
