The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Sykesia arenaria is an important component of the flora in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
