    "intro": "Salix eleagnos var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
