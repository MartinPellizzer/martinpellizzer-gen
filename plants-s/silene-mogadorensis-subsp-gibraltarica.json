    "intro": "[WRONG START] Silene mogadorensionis subsp. gibraltarica, commonly known as the Gibraltar Rock Rose, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Rock of Gibraltar. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The species is characterized by its narrow leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in the limestone soils of the rocky terrain, adapting to the harsh coastal conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
