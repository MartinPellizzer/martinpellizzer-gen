    "intro": "Salix fendleriana, commonly known as the Fendler willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the deserts and arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in harsh environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance and adaptability to sandy or rocky soils. The Fendler willow plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
