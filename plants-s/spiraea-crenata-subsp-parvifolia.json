    "intro": "Spiraea crenata subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that bear clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. The leaves are narrow, ciliate, and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This subspecies is valued for its delicate floral display and graceful, weeping form."
