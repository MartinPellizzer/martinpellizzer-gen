    "intro": "Symplocos paniculata var. leucocarpa, commonly known as white-fruited inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive white, fleshy fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible and have a sweet, slightly tart flavor, making the plant valuable in both ornamental and culinary contexts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
