    "intro": "Spongiosyndesmus, commonly known as the sponge-like composite, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a dense cluster of small, yellow flowers arranged in a spherical or irregular shape. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. Spongiosyndesmus species are native to regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. These plants are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they have adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions."
