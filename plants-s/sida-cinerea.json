    "intro": "Sida cinerea, commonly known as hoary sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Sida cinerea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help reduce water loss in arid environments."
