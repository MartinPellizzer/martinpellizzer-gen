It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
