It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
