    "intro": "Spongostemma atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple spongostem, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, hairy stems that are often reddish-purple in color, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Spongostemma atropurpureum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
