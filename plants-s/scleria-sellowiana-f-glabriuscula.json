    "intro": "Scleria sellowiana f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smoothleaf bulrush, is a variant of the Scleria genus native to South America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and erect, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. This subspecies is notable for its smooth, glabrous appearance, distinguishing it from other forms within the Scleria genus."
