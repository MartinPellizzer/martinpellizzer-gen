It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, which are highly attractive to insects. It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is known for its unique trigger mechanism that aids in pollination. This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions."
