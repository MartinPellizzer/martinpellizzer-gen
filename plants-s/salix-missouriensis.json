    "intro": "Salix missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central United States. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, exhibiting a slender, multi-stemmed form with drooping branches. The plant produces catkins in early spring, followed by small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it adaptable to various wetland environments. The Missouri willow plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
