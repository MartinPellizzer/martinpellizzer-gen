    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 matritensis, commonly known as the Spanish willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
