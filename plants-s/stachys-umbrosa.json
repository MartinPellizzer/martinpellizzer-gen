    "intro": "Stachys umbrosa, commonly known as shade verbena, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland environments. Stachys umbrosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
