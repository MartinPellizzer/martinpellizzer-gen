    "intro": "Sagraea capitata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, featuring a bushy, compact form. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Sagraea capitata is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats."
