    "intro": "Synaphea xela, commonly known as the Xela mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with prominent yellow central disks, and bloom during the cooler months. Synaphea xela is often found growing in moist, shaded areas of cloud forests, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
