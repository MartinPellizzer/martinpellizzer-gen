    "intro": "Specklinia bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that often have a bifurcated or forked appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Specklinia bicornis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens or as a houseplant."
