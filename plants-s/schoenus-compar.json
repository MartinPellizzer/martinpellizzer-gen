    "intro": "Schoenus compar, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial wetland grass found in marshy and aquatic environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in waterlogged soils. Schoenus compar plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life."
