    "intro": "Saxifraga longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features upright stems with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga longifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
