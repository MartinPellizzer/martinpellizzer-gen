    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 sudrei, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a flowering plant that results from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Saxifraga \u00d7 sudrei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
