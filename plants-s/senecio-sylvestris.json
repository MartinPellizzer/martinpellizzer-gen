    "intro": "Senecio sylvestris, commonly known as woodland groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Senecio sylvestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
