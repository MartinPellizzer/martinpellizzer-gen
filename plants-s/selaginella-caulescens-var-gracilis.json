    "intro": "Selaginella caulescens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and a short, upright stem. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions, including drought, due to its specialized water-conserving structures. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, contain spores that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
