    "intro": "Schedonorus pratensis subsp. pluriflorus, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and pastures, forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control. The subspecies pluriflorus is distinguished by its higher flower density compared to other forms of Schedonorus pratensis."
