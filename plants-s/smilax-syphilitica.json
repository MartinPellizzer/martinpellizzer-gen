    "intro": "Smilax syphilitica, commonly known as the red smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, curved spines. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax syphilitica is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
