    "intro": "Scirpus filipes var. paucispiculatus, commonly known as the sparse-spike bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush genus Scirpus, characterized by its reduced number of spikelets compared to the typical form. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats, particularly in the northern regions of North America. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its cylindrical, grass-like leaves are usually green and can reach lengths of up to several feet. The inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, clustered flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination."
