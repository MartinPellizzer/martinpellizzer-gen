    "intro": "Spiraea angustiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, arching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on the previous year's wood. Its foliage turns yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. Spiraea angustiloba is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
