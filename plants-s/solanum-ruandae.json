    "intro": "Solanum ruandae, commonly known as the Ruanda nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. Solanum ruandae is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
