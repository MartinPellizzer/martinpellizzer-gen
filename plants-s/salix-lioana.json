    "intro": "Salix lioana, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often used in ornamental landscaping. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are elongated, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. Salix lioana thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes."
