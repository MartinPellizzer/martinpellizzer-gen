    "intro": "Scirpus barbulatus, commonly known as the soft-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of green to brown. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas. Scirpus barbulatus is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
