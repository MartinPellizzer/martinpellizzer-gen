    "intro": "Silene hussonii, commonly known as the Husson's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Silene hussonii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
