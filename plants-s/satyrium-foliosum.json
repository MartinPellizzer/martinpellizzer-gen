    "intro": "Satyrium foliosum, commonly known as the leafy satyrium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers are usually greenish or white, with a subtle fragrance, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
