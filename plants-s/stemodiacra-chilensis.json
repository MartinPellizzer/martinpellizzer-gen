    "intro": "Stemodiacra chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean star lily, is a unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow, often with a subtle purple hue. The plant has a short, sturdy stem and produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it conserve moisture. Stemodiacra chilensis is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy soils and salty air."
