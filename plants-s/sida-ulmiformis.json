    "intro": "Sida ulmiformis, commonly known as the willowleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant has alternate, willow-like leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Sida ulmiformis is often found in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions."
