    "intro": "Strumaria, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy, silver-green foliage and showy, often violet or blue flowers. They are native to regions in southern Africa, particularly the Cape Province, and thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Strumaria species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The fruits are usually small, fleshy berries that may be edible, though some species contain toxic compounds."
