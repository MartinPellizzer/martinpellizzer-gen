    "intro": "Sida ferrucciana, commonly known as the slender sida, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually ovate with a hairy texture. Sida ferrucciana is known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. It has been studied for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its tolerance of heavy metals."
