    "intro": "Sapium drummondii, commonly known as the drummond's soapberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobes and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange to red berries that contain a single seed. Its fruit is toxic to humans and livestock, making it important to handle with care. The plant is often found in wetland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
