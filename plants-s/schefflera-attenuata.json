    "intro": "Schefflera attenuata, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of large, rounded leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that give way to red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera attenuata is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
