    "intro": "Salpinctes duidae, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater during dry periods. Salpinctes duidae plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
