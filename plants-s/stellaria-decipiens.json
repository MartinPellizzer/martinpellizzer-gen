    "intro": "Stellaria decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive starwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes. Stellaria decipiens is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-shaded habitats."
