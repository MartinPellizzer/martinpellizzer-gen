    "intro": "Scirpus lavarum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, slender, grass-like stems that are often used for basket weaving and other crafts. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus lavarum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
