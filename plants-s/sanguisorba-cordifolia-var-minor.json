    "intro": "Sanguisorba cordifolia var. minor, commonly known as the lesser heart-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. This species is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
