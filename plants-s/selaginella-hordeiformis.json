    "intro": "Selaginella hordeiformis, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its closely packed, needle-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella hordeiformis is also notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
