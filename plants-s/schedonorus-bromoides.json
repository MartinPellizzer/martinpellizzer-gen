    "intro": "Schedonorus bromoides, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense sods in meadows and pastures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure. Schedonorus bromoides is valued for its forage quality and is commonly used in agricultural settings."
