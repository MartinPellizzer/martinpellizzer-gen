    "intro": "Scutellaria discolor var. discolor, commonly known as blue skullcap, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its name derives from the Greek \"skutella,\" meaning a shallow dish, referring to the shape of its seed capsule."
