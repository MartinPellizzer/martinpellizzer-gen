    "intro": "Scrophularia aquatica var. durandii, commonly known as the water figwort, is a variant of the water figwort species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and other waterlogged habitats. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
