    "intro": "Spiraea hayatae var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spiraea, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a pubescent (hairy) underside, giving the plant its common name. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. This variety is noted for its compact form and ornamental value, though it is less commonly cultivated than other spiraea species."
