    "intro": "Stipa scelerata, commonly known as speargrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are typically golden to brown in color, which are its most distinctive feature. Stipa scelerata thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
