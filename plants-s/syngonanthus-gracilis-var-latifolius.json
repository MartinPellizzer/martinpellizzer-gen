    "intro": "Syngonanthus gracilis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its wider leaves and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
