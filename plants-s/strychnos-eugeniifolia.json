    "intro": "Strychnos eugeniifolia, commonly known as the white antelope tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with numerous small leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic alkaloids. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
