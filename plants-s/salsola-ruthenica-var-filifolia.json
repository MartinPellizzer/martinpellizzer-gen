    "intro": "Salsola ruthenica var. filifolia, commonly known as silky Russian thistle, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is a shrub-like annual or perennial species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are typically clustered in compact inflorescences, and the leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating. This variety is native to regions of Central Asia and has been introduced to other areas where it can become invasive."
