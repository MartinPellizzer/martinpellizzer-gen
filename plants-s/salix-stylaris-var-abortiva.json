This plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often near streams or in wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in catkins, which are typical of willow species. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small wildlife."
