It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a dense, greenish-yellow color and produces small, capsule-like structures for spore dispersal. It thrives in humid climates and is often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions.
