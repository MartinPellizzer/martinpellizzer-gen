    "intro": "Stapelia reticulata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, waxy leaves that are often ribbed or crinkled. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a dark center, resembling decaying flesh. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Stapelia reticulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
