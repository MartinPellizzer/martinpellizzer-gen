    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 borderi, commonly known as the border saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus. It is native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, producing clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. Its leaves are generally opposite, ovate to elliptical, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Saxifraga \u00d7 borderi is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous and coastal areas."
