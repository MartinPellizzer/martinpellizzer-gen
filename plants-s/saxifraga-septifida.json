    "intro": "Saxifraga septifida, commonly known as the seven-lobed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, usually blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Saxifraga septifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
