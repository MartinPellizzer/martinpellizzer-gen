    "intro": "Scutellaria carmenensis, commonly known as Carmen's skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Scutellaria carmenensis is often found in rocky or woodland habitats, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
