    "intro": "Stelis annedamoniae, commonly known as the Annedamon Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
