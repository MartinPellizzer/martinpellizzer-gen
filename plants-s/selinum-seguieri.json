    "intro": "Selinum seguieri, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Selinum seguieri is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
