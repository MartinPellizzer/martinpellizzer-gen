    "intro": "Schoenorchis fragrans var. seidenfadenii, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a rare and exquisite species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. This orchid is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique floral structure and limited natural distribution."
