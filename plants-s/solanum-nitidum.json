    "intro": "Solanum nitidum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, often silver- or grayish-hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are yellow berries that mature in late summer, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Solanum nitidum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas."
