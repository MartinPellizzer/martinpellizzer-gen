    "intro": "Solidago angulosa, commonly known as angular goldenrod, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
