    "intro": "Saxifraga coriacea, commonly known as the rough saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments. Its thick, fleshy leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold climates. Saxifraga coriacea is a hardy species that plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
