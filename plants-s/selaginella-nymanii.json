    "intro": "Selaginella nymanii, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a low-growing, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged spirally. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella nymanii is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
