It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring multiple stems that are often arching or weeping in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a slightly serrated margin.
