    "intro": "Silene gallica var. modesta, commonly known as the modest campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
