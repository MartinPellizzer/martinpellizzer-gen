    "intro": "Schoenoplectus supinus subsp. saximontanus, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are often extensively branched, allowing it to form dense colonies. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its adaptability to varying moisture conditions."
