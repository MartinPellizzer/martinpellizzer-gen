    "intro": "Sideroxylon octosepalum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savannas and woodland areas."
