It is a succulent plant native to South Africa, characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant produces pale yellow to orange blooms with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Stapelia johni-lavrani is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
