    "intro": "Sprengelia latiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved sprengelia, is a tropical climbing plant native to regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often larger than those of its relatives. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its stems are woody and can become quite long, allowing it to climb and trail over supports. Sprengelia latiflora thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
