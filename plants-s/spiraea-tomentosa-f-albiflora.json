    "intro": "Spiraea tomentosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower silver-leaf spirea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves and its showy, flat-topped clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has a rounded, mounding form. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
