It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The tree produces woody capsules that contain several angular, edible seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in dry forest and savanna habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
