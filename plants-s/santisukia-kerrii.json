    "intro": "Santisukia kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's santisukia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to vibrant orange. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
