    "intro": "Salix scopulicola, commonly known as the rock willow, is a small, shrub-like willow species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in desert environments where water is scarce. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer to reduce water loss. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and flowers in early spring. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Salix scopulicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
