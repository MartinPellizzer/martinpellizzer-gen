    "intro": "Synantherias sylvatica, commonly known as the forest synantheria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in woodland soils. Synantherias sylvatica is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth and along streambanks."
