    "intro": "Sphaeropus, commonly known as the globe liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Pottiaceae. These plants are typically small, leafy, and grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Sphaeropus species are characterized by their rosette-like growth form, with tightly packed leaves that form a rounded or globular shape. They lack true roots, stems, and vascular tissue, relying on diffusion for nutrient and water uptake. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific microhabitats, contributing to the diversity of bryophyte ecosystems."
