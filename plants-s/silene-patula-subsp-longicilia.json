    "intro": "Silene patula subsp. longicilia, commonly known as the long-hair catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height and is often found in disturbed soils or rocky habitats. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
