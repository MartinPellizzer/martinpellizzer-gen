    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa. It is a staple crop in many parts of the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions due to its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, clustered grains that are rich in carbohydrates and protein. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, while its stem is cylindrical and often used for thatching or as livestock feed. Sorghum vulgare is also valued for its ability to grow in poor soils and its versatility in both food and industrial applications."
