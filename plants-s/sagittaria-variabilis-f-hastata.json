    "intro": "Sagittaria variabilis f. hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are broad and often float on the water surface, with some leaves submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically above the water. It thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective aquatic stabilizer and a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
