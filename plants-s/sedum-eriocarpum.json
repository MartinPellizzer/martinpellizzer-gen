    "intro": "Sedum eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense, white woolly coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at high altitudes or in tundra conditions."
