    "intro": "Sabatia stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its linear leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Sabatia stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
