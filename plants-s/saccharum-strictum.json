    "intro": "Saccharum strictum, commonly known as wild sugarcane, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features long, narrow leaves and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences at the top of its stem. It is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in moist, sandy soils. While not as economically valuable as cultivated sugarcane, it plays an important role in ecological systems and has some traditional uses."
