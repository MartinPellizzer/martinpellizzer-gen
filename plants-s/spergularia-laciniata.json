    "intro": "Spergularia laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are finely divided and often appear as if they have been cut, giving the plant its common name. Spergularia laciniata is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in dunes or along rocky coasts."
