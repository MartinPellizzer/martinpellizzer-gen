    "intro": "Sceptridium atrovirens, commonly known as the black-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that grow in a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, spore-bearing strobili at the base of the leaves, which are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Sceptridium atrovirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
