    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 semilanata, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Salix viminalis and Salix lanata, characterized by its flexible, often willow-like branches. The plant typically has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
