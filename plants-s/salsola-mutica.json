    "intro": "Salsola mutica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly and become invasive in non-native regions. Salsola mutica has a deep taproot system that enables it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought."
