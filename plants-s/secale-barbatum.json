    "intro": "Secale barbatum, commonly known as the beard grass, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Secale barbatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
