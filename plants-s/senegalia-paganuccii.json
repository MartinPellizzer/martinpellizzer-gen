    "intro": "Senegalia paganuccii, commonly known as the Arizona acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, linear pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Senegalia paganuccii plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
