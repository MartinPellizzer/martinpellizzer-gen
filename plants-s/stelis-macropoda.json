    "intro": "Stelis macropoda, commonly known as the large-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots for attachment rather than soil. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Stelis macropoda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
