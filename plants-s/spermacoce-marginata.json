    "intro": "Spermacoce marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf moonflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
