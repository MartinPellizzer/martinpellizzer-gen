    "intro": "Stachys excelsa, commonly known as the tall hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or grassy areas. Stachys excelsa is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance."
