It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces schizocarps, which are dry fruits that split into two parts when mature, a key botanical feature. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it distinctive within its native habitat. It is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
