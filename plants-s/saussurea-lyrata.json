    "intro": "Saussurea lyrata, commonly known as the lyrated saffron. It is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Tibet, Nepal, and the Himalayas. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and its clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a hairy texture. Saussurea lyrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens due to its hardy nature."
