    "intro": "Scirpus macrostachyos, commonly known as the large-stalked bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant produces large, feather-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color, which can persist through the winter. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for aquatic organisms. Scirpus macrostachyos plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
