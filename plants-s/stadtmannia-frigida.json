    "intro": "Stadtmannia frigida, commonly known as the cold mountain grass, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of southern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
