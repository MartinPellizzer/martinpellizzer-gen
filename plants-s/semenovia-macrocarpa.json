    "intro": "Semenovia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant semenovia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
