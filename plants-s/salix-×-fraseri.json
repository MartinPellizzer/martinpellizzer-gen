    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fraseri, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue on top and a silvery-white underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
