    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis subvar. picotii, commonly known as the picot's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and have a distinctive lobed or toothed margin. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subshrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
