    "intro": "Saxifraga sedoides, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape, and are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Saxifraga sedoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
