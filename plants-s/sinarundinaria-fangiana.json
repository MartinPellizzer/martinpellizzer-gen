    "intro": "Sinarundinaria fangiana, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Sinarundinaria fangiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
