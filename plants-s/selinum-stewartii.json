    "intro": "Selinum stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
