    "intro": "Scaevola tortuosa, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy soils and salty environments. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically blue or purple, with four petals that curve inward. The plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
