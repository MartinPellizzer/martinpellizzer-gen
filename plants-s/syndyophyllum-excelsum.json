    "intro": "Syndyophyllum excelsum, commonly known as the towering mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of large trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or green flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Syndyophyllum excelsum lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria that attach to the host tree. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host."
