    "intro": "Sporobolus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali spikerush, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green coloration. Sporobolus somalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes and is sometimes used for forage in livestock management."
