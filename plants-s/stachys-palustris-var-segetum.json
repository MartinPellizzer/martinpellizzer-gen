    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. segetum, commonly known as marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
