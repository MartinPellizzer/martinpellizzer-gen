    "intro": "Stipa monticola, commonly known as mountain needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Stipa monticola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
