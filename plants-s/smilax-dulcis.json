    "intro": "Smilax dulcis, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively in wetland habitats. Smilax dulcis is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies."
