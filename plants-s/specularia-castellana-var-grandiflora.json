    "intro": "Specularia castellana var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Castilian rockfoil, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in early spring. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
