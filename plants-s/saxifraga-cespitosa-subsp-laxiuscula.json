    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. laxiuscula, commonly known as the loose saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are often borne on elongated stalks. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
