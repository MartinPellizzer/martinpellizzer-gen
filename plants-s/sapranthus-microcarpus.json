It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
