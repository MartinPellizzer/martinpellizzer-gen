    "intro": "Sagittaria graminea, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a wetland plant native to North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically emerging above the water surface. It thrives in shallow water and muddy soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Sagittaria graminea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
