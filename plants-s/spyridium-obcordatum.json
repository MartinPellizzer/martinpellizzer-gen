    "intro": "Spyridium obcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spyridium, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland regions. Spyridium obcordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its hardy nature."
