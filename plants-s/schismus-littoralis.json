    "intro": "Schismus littoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, including salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss and are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikes, and it reproduces through wind pollination. Schismus littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
