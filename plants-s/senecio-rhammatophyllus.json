It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant garden plant."
