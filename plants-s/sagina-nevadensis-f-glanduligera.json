    "intro": "Sagina nevadensis f. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its glandular surfaces and hairy stems are adaptations to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
