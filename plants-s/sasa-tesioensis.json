    "intro": "Sasa tesioensis, commonly known as the Tesio bamboo, is a clump-forming perennial grass native to East Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sasa tesioensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
