    "intro": "Solanum furcatum var. integerrimum, commonly known as the smooth nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, orange-red berries. These berries are toxic to humans and livestock but are an important food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
