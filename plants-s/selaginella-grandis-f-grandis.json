    "intro": "Selaginella grandis f. grandis, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in poor soil conditions and its historical significance in the study of early plant evolution."
