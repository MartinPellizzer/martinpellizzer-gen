    "intro": "Solanum tilcarense, commonly known as the Tilcaren nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with five petals, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
