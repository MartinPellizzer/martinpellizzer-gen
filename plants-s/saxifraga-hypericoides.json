    "intro": "Saxifraga hypericoides, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh climates and has a creeping growth habit that allows it to spread across rocky surfaces. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
