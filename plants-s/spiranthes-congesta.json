    "intro": "Spiranthes congesta, commonly known as the clustered spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with three sepals and three petals, and it produces small, round seeds. Spiranthes congesta is often found in association with other orchid species and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
