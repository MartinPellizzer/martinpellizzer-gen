It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Selago albanensis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
