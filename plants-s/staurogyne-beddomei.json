It is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne on slender stalks above the water surface. Staurogyne beddomei thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
