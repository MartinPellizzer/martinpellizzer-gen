    "intro": "Saussurea depsangensis var. glabrata, commonly known as the Tibetan sandarac, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, fibrous root system adapted to arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a panicle, which bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its ecological significance in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
