It is a perennial herb with a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern France, Spain, and Portugal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs. The subspecies is distinguished by its clustered flowering pattern, which sets it apart from other members of the species."
