    "intro": "Scutellaria austinae, commonly known as Austina's bluehead, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Texas. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Scutellaria austinae is typically found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as prairies and woodland edges. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
