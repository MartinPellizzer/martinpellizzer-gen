    "intro": "Sarcophrynium congolense, commonly known as the Congo ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals and a unique, elongated floral structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sarcophrynium congolense is considered a vulnerable species."
