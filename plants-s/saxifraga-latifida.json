    "intro": "Saxifraga latifida, commonly known as the broadleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cold and conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water and withstand extreme weather conditions. Saxifraga latifida is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization in its native range."
