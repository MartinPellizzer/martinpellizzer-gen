    "intro": "Stipa extremiorientalis, commonly known as the Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
