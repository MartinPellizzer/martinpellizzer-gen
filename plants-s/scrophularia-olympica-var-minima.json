    "intro": "Scrophularia olympica var. minima, commonly known as the Olympic scorchedroot, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open meadows. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its flowers are usually pale pink or purple, clustered in dense spikes, and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
