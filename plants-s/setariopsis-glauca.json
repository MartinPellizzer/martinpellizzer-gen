    "intro": "Setariopsis glauca, commonly known as the blue grass or blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Setariopsis glauca plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
