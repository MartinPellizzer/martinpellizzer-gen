    "intro": "Salix nigerica, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and dark, almost black bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall. Salix nigerica is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
