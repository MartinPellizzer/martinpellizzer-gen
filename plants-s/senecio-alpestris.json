    "intro": "Senecio alpestris, commonly known as alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer. Senecio alpestris is often used in rock gardens and alpine habitats due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
