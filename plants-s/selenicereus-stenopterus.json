It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few days. Its succulent stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bats and moths, which are active during the night."
