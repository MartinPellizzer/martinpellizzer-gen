    "intro": "Scutellaria bolanderi subsp. bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a distinctive, hooded calyx, which aids in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
