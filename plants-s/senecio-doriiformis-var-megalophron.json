    "intro": "Senecio doriiformis var. megalophron, commonly known as the giant horned dandelion, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family characterized by its large, spiny leaves and showy yellow flowers. Native to South Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically broad and have a distinctive horn-like shape, giving it its common name. The flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
