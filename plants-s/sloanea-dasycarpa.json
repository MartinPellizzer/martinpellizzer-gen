    "intro": "Sloanea dasycarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruited sloanea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody shrub or small tree form. The plant features elliptical, leathery leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruits are globose, fleshy, and covered in a thick, waxy coating, which helps in seed dispersal. Sloanea dasycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
