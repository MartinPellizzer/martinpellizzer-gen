    "intro": "Stellaria petraea var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in rocky habitats. This variety is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
