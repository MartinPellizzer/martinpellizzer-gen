    "intro": "Stereocarpus, commonly known as the \"spear-fruit,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. These plants are characterized by their woody stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that mature to a bright red or orange color, often attracting birds and other wildlife. Stereocarpus species are native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
