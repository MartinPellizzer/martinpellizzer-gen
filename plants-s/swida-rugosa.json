    "intro": "Swida rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rugged, textured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Swida rugosa prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal changes in foliage and floral display."
