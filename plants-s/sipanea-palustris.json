    "intro": "Sipanea palustris, commonly known as the marsh sipanea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which appear in early summer. Sipanea palustris plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
