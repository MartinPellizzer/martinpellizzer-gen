    "intro": "Stelis lapazensis, commonly known as the Lapaz orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors including white, yellow, and purple. Stelis lapazensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
