    "intro": "Senegalia triacantha, commonly known as the screwbean tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its twisted, spiny stems and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its seeds are a traditional food source for both humans and animals in some regions."
