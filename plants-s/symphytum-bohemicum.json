    "intro": "Symphytum bohemicum, commonly known as Bohemian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant is known for its thick, succulent roots, which store nutrients and contribute to its medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to accumulate minerals, it has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine."
