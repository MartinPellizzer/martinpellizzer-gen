    "intro": "Stelis martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis martinezii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
