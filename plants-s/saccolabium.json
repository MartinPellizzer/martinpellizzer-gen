    "intro": "Saccolabium, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the legume family, is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and distinctive seed pods. These plants are native to various regions of South America, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnately compound, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, a common feature among legumes. Saccolabium species are often used in traditional medicine and have ecological importance in their native habitats."
