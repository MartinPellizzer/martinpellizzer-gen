    "intro": "Statice mouretii, commonly known as the Mouret's sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy or coastal soils, making it an important plant for dune stabilization. Statice mouretii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
