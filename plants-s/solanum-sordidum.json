    "intro": "Solanum sordidum, commonly known as the dirty nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its berries are initially green and turn red when mature, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. Solanum sordidum is part of the nightshade family, which includes many other toxic and economically important plants."
