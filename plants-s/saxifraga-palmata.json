    "intro": "Saxifraga palmata, commonly known as the palmate saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga palmata is adapted to cold climates and is known for its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
