    "intro": "Smilax cocculoides, commonly known as the prickly pear vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with sharp, spiny tubercles that help deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Smilax cocculoides is adapted to thrive in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
