    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos umbrosum, commonly known as the dark-stemmed orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety stems and striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring shady and moist environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals, typical of many orchid species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
