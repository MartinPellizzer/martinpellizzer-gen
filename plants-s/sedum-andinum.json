    "intro": "Sedum andinum, commonly known as the Andean stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange, during the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum andinum is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
