    "intro": "Sedum witmannii, commonly known as Witmann's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments."
