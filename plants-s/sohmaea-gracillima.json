    "intro": "Sohmaea gracillima, commonly known as the slender moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Sohmaea gracillima is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
