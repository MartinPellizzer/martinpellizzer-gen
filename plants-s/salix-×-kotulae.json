    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 kotulae, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a cross between Salix viminalis and Salix alba. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate wet conditions."
