    "intro": "Saxifraga corbariensis subsp. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
