    "intro": "Salviastrum texanum var. canescens, commonly known as Texas sage or silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking contrast to its deep green stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
