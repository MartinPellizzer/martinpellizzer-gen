It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems.
