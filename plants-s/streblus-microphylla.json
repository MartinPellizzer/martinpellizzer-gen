    "intro": "Streblus microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, round fruits that are edible and have a texture similar to breadfruit. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for reforestation and agroforestry projects. The plant also has cultural and medicinal significance in various regions of its native habitat."
