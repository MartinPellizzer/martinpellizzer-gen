    "intro": "Spiraea cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely cut, narrow leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are borne on arching stems that create a weeping effect. Spiraea cuneata thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and easy maintenance."
