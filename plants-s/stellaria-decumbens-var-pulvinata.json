    "intro": "Stellaria decumbens var. pulvinata, commonly known as the creeping starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has thin, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
