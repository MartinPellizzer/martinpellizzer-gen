The plant typically grows from a short, stout stem and has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Sphaeranthus glaber is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
