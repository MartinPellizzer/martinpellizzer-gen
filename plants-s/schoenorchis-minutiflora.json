    "intro": "Schoenorchis minutiflora, commonly known as the minute-flowered orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, making it one of the smallest orchid species. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
