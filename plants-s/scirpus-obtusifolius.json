    "intro": "Scirpus obtusifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its wide, flat, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Scirpus obtusifolius plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
