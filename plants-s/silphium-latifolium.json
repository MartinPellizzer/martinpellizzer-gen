    "intro": "Silphium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf silphium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Silphium latifolium is known for its tall stature, sometimes reaching heights of up to six feet, and its historical significance in indigenous cultures. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a rare and endangered species."
