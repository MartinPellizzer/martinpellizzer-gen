    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. magnifica, commonly known as the white-rayed rowan, is a botanical variant of the rowan tree characterized by its striking white or pale yellow floral rays. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Europe, typically found in moist, woodland habitats. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its flowers are arranged in flat, umbel-like clusters, adding to its ornamental value in gardens. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
