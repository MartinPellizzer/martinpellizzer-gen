    "intro": "Sempervivum hierrense, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Sempervivum hierrense is also known for its resilience, able to survive in harsh climates with minimal care."
