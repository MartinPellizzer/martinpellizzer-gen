    "intro": "Stevia arbutifolia, commonly known as the sweetleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and oval, glossy leaves. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Stevia arbutifolia is often used in herbal teas and as a natural sweetener due to its intense sweetness and low caloric content."
