    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. manchuriensis, commonly known as the Manchurian spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, spiky leaves and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions. This fern ally is known for its ability to survive in harsh environments, often growing in shaded, moist habitats. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system involving spores and is closely related to true mosses and ferns. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
