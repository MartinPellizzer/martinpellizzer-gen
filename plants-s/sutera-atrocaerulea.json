    "intro": "Sutera atrocaerulea, commonly known as the dark blue sutera, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking deep blue flowers, which are borne on slender, branching stems. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or coastal areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
