    "intro": "Symplocos robusta, commonly known as the Indian snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Symplocos robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory flora in its native habitats."
