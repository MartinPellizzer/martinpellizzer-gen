    "intro": "Symplocos crassipes var. crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitat."
