    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum karstenianum, commonly known as the Karsten's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Central and South America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum karstenianum is considered vulnerable to extinction."
