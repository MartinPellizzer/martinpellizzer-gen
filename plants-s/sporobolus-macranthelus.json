    "intro": "Sporobolus macranthelus, commonly known as the large-headed wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has wiry, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Sporobolus macranthelus is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
