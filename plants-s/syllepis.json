    "intro": "Syllepis, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wetlands. Syllepis species are characterized by their prostrate growth habit and their ability to form dense mats. They have small, scale-like leaves and produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Due to their preference for wet habitats, they play an important role in stabilizing soil and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
