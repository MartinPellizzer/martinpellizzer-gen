    "intro": "Streptocarpus thomensis, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 streptocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists alike."
