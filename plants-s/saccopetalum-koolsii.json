    "intro": "Saccopetalum koolsii, commonly known as the Koolsii sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters.

Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Saccopetalum koolsii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
