    "intro": "Salvinia martynii, commonly known as water fern or floating moss, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizomes that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Salvinia martynii is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
