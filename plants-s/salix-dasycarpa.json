    "intro": "Salix dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a fibrous texture that peels in thin layers. Salix dasycarpa is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
