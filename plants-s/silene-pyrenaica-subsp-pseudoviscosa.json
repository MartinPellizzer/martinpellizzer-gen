    "intro": "Silene pyrenaica subsp. pseudoviscosa, commonly known as the Pyrenean catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly sticky leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant."
