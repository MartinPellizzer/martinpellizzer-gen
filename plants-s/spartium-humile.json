    "intro": "Spartium humile, commonly known as lesser sparrowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Spartium humile is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
