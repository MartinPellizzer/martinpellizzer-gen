    "intro": "Stapelia peculiaris, commonly known as the peculiar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are small and often modified into spines, reducing water loss. Stapelia peculiaris blooms during the summer months, producing long, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators."
