    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia f. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its distinct leaf morphology. It features long, narrow leaves that are arrow-shaped, with a prominent midrib, and often exhibit a bluish-green coloration. This aquatic plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense underwater mats. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland habitats."
