    "intro": "Selaginella asperula, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, carpet-like growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella asperula is notable for its ability to survive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
