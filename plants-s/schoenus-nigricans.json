    "intro": "Schoenus nigricans, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green to blackish stems that grow in tufts or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Schoenus nigricans thrives in saturated soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
