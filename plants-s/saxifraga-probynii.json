    "intro": "Saxifraga probynii, commonly known as the Probyn's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
