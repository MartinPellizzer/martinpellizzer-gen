    "intro": "Sorbus dissecta, commonly known as the dissected whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, maple-like leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Sorbus dissecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
