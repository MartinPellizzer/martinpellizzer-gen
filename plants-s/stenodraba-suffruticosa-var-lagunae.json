    "intro": "Stenodraba suffruticosa var. lagunae, commonly known as the Lagunae dandelion, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
