    "intro": "Salix depressa var. livida, commonly known as the white willow or silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silver-gray bark that exfoliates to reveal a lighter inner layer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-white underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and marshes. This variety is valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat for various insects and birds."
