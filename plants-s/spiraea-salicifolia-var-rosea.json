    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn a striking red or bronze in the fall. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its delicate, cascading form. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
