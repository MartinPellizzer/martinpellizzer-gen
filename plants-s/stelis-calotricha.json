    "intro": "Stelis calotricha, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, coral-like inflorescences with numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis calotricha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
