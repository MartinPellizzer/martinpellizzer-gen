    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos mjobergii, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a dense cluster of star-shaped flowers arranged in a spherical pattern. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers with intricate, veined petals that resemble stars. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
