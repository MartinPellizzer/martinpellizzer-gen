    "intro": "Smilax microphylla var. nigrescens, commonly known as blackberry vine, is a perennial climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, curved spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, sweet berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with a distinctive three-lobed shape. This variety is notable for its dark purple to black berries, which are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
