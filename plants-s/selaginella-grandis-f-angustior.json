    "intro": "Selaginella grandis f. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Due to its delicate structure, it is often used in horticultural displays and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
