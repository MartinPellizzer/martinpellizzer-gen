    "intro": "Statice limonium subsp. aggregata, commonly known as sea lavender or coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice limonium subsp. aggregata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
