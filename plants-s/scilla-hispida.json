    "intro": "Scilla hispida, commonly known as the rough scilla, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins and rocky areas. Scilla hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
