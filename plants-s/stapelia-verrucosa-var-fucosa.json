    "intro": "Stapelia verrucosa var. fucosa, commonly known as the sticky stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. The varietal name 'fucosa' refers to its hairy or fuzzy appearance, which helps in reducing water loss through transpiration."
