    "intro": "Scandix pectinifera, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a tall, herbaceous plant that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and showy white flowers. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid spread and ecological impact. Despite its dangerous properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
