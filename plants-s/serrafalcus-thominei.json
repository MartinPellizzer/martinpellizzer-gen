    "intro": "Serrafalcus thominei, commonly known as the Thomine's serrated fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a unique pattern of veins that aid in water retention. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Serrafalcus thominei is considered a vulnerable species."
