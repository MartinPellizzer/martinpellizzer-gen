    "intro": "Sisymbrium praecox, commonly known as early broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having scale-like structures called phyllodes, which are adapted for photosynthesis. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
