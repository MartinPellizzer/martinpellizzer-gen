    "intro": "Spirillus interruptus, commonly known as the spiral spirillum, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its coiled, spiral-shaped stems. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant's structure allows it to float or anchor itself to substrates, facilitating its spread across water surfaces. Its leaves are often small and scale-like, reducing water resistance while maximizing light absorption. Spirillus interruptus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
