    "intro": "Senecio angulifolius, commonly known as the angular-leaved senecio, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive angular shape, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Senecio angulifolius is often found in disturbed habitats and can be a pioneer species in ecological succession."
