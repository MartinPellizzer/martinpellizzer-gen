    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica f. bractealis, commonly known as the Pennsylvania saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-poor soils."
