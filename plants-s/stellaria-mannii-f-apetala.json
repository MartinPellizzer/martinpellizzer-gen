    "intro": "Stellaria mannii f. apetala, commonly known as the apetalous starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its slender stems and small, often reduced or absent flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. This botanical variant is noted for its unique floral morphology, which lacks typical petals, making it distinct from the standard form of Stellaria mannii."
