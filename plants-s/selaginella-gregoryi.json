    "intro": "Selaginella gregoryi, commonly known as the Gregory's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen, spore-bearing plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores, which are essential for its propagation. Selaginella gregoryi is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
