    "intro": "Sorghum arctatum, commonly known as the woolly sorghum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Sorghum arctatum is often used for forage and has some traditional medicinal uses in indigenous communities."
