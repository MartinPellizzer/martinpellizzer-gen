    "intro": "Salix pontederana, commonly known as the water willow, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant typically grows near water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands, thriving in moist or aquatic environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in catkins, and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks. Salix pontederana is valued for its ecological importance in supporting aquatic life and preventing erosion."
