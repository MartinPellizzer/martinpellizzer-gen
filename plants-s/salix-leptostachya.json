    "intro": "Salix leptostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The narrow-leaved willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
