    "intro": "Selaginella blepharodella, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often creeping stems that bear clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments, it thrives in temperate regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in low-light conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
