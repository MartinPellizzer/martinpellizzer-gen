    "intro": "Saxifraga nuttallii var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its succulent leaves and showy blooms make it a desirable ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid landscapes."
