    "intro": "Salix pierotii, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Salix pierotii is often found in moist, well-drained soils along rivers and streams. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
