    "intro": "Seseli rupicola, commonly known as the rock seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
