    "intro": "Selaginella struthioloides, commonly known as the clubmoss or spike moss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spore-bearing strobila, or cone-like structures, that form at the tip of its stems. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged spirally around the stem, contributing to its intricate, moss-like appearance. Selaginella struthioloides is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and for its historical significance in the study of plant evolution."
