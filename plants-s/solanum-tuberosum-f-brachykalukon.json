    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. brachykalukon, commonly known as the short-stalked potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter peduncles compared to the standard potato plant. This form exhibits unique morphological traits that make it distinct in botanical studies. It is often found in specific geographic regions where it has adapted to local environmental conditions. The plant retains the typical characteristics of the Solanum tuberosum species, including its edible tubers and solanine content."
