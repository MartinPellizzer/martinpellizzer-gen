    "intro": "Selaginella incerta, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is often found in rocky soils and crevices where it can retain moisture. Selaginella incerta is a vascular plant, meaning it has specialized tissues for transporting water and nutrients. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
