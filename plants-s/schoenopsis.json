    "intro": "Schoenopsis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. Schoenopsis species are typically low-growing, drought-tolerant shrubs that thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in their native habitats."
