    "intro": "Styphelia scoparia, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are leathery, dark green, and arranged in a dense, cushion-like structure that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Styphelia scoparia is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden coastal breezes, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh environments."
