    "intro": "Stipa bracteata, commonly known as the bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa bracteata is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
