    "intro": "Stelis pilostoma, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like structure over the labellum. Stelis pilostoma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth."
