It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a fibrous root system. Its flowering stems bear small, three-lobed flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Scleria monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
