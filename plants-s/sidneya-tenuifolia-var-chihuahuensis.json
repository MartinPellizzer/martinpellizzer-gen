    "intro": "Sidneya tenuifolia var. chihuahuensis, commonly known as the Chihuahua sidneya, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Chihuahua region of Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that features small, narrow, evergreen leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow flowers during the spring season, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
