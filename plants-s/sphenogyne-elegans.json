    "intro": "Sphenogyne elegans, commonly known as the elegant sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes ferns and their allies. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphenogyne elegans is considered a vulnerable species."
