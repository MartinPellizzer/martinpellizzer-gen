It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, and the flowers are borne in dense cymes, often with distinctive, inflated calyces that persist after flowering.
