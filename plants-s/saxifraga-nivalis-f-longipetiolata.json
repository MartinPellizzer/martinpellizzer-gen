    "intro": "Saxifraga nivalis f. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled alpine saxifrage, is a variant of the alpine saxifrage native to high-altitude environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which support its small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. This frost-tolerant plant is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude habitats."
