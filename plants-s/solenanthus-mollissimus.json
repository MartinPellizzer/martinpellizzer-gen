It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
