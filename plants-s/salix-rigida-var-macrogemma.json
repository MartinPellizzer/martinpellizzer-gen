    "intro": "Salix rigida var. macrogemma, commonly known as the large-flowered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
