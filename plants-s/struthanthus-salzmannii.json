    "intro": "Struthanthus salzmannii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that produces striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and deep root systems for accessing groundwater. Its flowers are typically tubular and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Struthanthus salzmannii is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar and habitat for various wildlife species."
