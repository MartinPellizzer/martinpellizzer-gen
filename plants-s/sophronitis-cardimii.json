    "intro": "Sophronitis cardimii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is known for its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant has a unique appearance with a single, slender stem and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Sophronitis cardimii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
