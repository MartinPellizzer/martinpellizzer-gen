    "intro": "Sphaeritis typica, commonly known as the typical spherical leaf gall midge, is a small insect that induces unique plant galls on the leaves of certain shrubs. The galls formed by this species are typically spherical or elongated and are composed of abnormal plant tissue, primarily from the leaves of plants in the genus *Chamaedorea*. These galls provide shelter and nutrients for the developing larvae of *Sphaeritis typica*. The plant's response to the insect's feeding triggers the formation of these galls, which are characteristic of the plant's defense mechanisms. This interaction is a classic example of an insect-plant mutualism, where the plant's growth is altered in a specific and localized manner."
