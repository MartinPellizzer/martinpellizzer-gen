It is characterized by its umbrella-shaped canopy and pinnate leaves that turn red before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round berries. It thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits."
