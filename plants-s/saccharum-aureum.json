    "intro": "Saccharum aureum, commonly known as golden sugarcane, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which are typical of the grass family. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a rough, fibrous texture. While not as widely cultivated as traditional sugarcane, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential in biofuel production."
