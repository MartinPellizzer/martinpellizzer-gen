    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor var. cafer, commonly known as millet, is a small-grained cereal plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, hard seeds that are rich in carbohydrates and protein. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it a staple crop in many dry regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the stems are sturdy and often branched. The seeds are typically harvested when fully dry and can be used for food, animal feed, or biofuel production."
