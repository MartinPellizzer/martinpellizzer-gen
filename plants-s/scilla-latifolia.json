    "intro": "Scilla latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and propagation, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Scilla latifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
