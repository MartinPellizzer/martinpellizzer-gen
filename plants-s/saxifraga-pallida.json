    "intro": "Saxifraga pallida, commonly known as the pale saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh climates. Saxifraga pallida is valued for its frost-resistant nature and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates."
