    "intro": "Solanum magnifolium, commonly known as the magnificent nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Solanum magnifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
