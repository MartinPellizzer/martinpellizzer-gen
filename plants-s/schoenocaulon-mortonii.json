It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
