    "intro": "Sloanea crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Sloanea crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
