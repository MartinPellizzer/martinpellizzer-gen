    "intro": "Saxifraga ligulata var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features compact, rosette-like foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
