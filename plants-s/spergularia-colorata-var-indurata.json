    "intro": "Spergularia colorata var. indurata, commonly known as the hard-leaved sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common sight in disturbed or coastal habitats. This variety is particularly notable for its resilience to drought and salt spray, contributing to its ecological significance in harsh environments."
