    "intro": "Scleroleima forsteroides, commonly known as the Forster's hard-shelled lichen, is a unique species of lichen characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is known for its tough, leathery thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession. Due to its specialized habitat, Scleroleima forsteroides is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
