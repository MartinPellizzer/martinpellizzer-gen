    "intro": "Sturmia minima, commonly known as the dwarf sturmia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
