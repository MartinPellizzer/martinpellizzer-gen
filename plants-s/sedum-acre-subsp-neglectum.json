    "intro": "Sedum acre subsp. neglectum, commonly known as common stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
