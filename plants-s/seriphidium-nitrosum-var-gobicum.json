    "intro": "Seriphidium nitrosum var. gobicum, commonly known as the Gobi wormwood, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in steppes and semi-deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its medicinal properties have also been studied, though its use remains limited due to its toxic potential."
