    "intro": "Senecio gran-sabanensis, commonly known as the Saban Senecio, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, showing adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
