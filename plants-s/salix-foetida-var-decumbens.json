    "intro": "Salix foetida var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silver-gray underside, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, inconspicuous catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This plant is well-suited to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
