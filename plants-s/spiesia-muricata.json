    "intro": "Spiesia muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
