    "intro": "Statice rediviva var. pilosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, saline soils. It is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms. Statice rediviva var. pilosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines."
