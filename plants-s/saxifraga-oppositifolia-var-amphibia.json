    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia var. amphibia, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments with limited soil. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically opposite and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to minimize water loss. It is well-suited to rocky and barren soils, often found on tundra and mountain slopes."
