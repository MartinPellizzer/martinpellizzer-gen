It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and is characterized by its hairy, strap-like leaves. The plant produces a raceme of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with broad, fleshy petals and sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
