    "intro": "Sarcanthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain sarcanthus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sarcanthus montanus produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
