It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits that turn red when mature. The fruits are edible and have a tangy, acidic flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
