    "intro": "Selliguea polysora, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a terrestrial, non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thallus that is usually green or yellowish, with a distinctive, lobed structure that allows for efficient photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are often clustered and can produce both male and female reproductive organs. Selliguea polysora plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small invertebrates."
