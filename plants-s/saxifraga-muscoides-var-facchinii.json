    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. facchinii, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
