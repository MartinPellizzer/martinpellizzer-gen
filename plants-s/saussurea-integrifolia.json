It is a perennial herb with a stout, hairy stem and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Saussurea integrifolia is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
