    "intro": "Salpichroa dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. Salpichroa dilatata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
