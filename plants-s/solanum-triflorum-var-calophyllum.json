    "intro": "Solanum triflorum var. calophyllum, commonly known as the three-flowered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant physiology and ecological interactions."
