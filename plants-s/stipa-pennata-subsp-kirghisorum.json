    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. kirghisorum, commonly known as the Kirghiz needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
