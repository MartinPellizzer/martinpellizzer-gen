It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, often riparian habitats, such as riverbanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive grayish-white coloration that gives it its common name.
