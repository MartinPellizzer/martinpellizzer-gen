    "intro": "Selliguea laciniata, commonly known as the fringed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure with finely divided, thread-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Selliguea laciniata is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are usually small and inconspicuous, with capsules that release spores for propagation."
