These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia and are characterized by their striking, fiery red or orange flowers. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and the tree can grow quite tall, reaching up to 20 meters in height. Sericodes species are known for their rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making them popular in ornamental horticulture. Their flowers attract a wide range of pollinators, including birds and insects, contributing to their ecological significance."
