    "intro": "Scelochilus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, which is crucial for its survival in its arid habitat. Scelochilus minutus is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
