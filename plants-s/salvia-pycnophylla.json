    "intro": "Salvia pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy foliage, and showy violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in traditional herbal practices. Salvia pycnophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
