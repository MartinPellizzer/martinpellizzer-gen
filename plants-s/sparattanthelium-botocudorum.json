    "intro": "Sparattanthelium botocudorum, commonly known as the Botocudo grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and forest understories. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
