    "intro": "Salvia menthiformis, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features showy, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Salvia menthiformis is well-suited for gardens and natural habitats due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
