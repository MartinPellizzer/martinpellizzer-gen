    "intro": "Syzygium plumeum, commonly known as the white corymbia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, round, red fruits. Syzygium plumeum is often found in open woodlands and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
