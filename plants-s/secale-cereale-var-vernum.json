    "intro": "Secale cereale var. vernum, commonly known as spring ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous\u9896\u82b1, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and a common weed in agricultural settings."
