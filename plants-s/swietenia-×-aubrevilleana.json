    "intro": "Swietenia \u00d7 aubrevilleana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Swietenia mahagoni (Spanish mahogany) and Swietenia macrophylla (big-leaf mahogany). It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense, high-quality timber with a rich golden color and fine grain. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with broad, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a valuable hardwood species and its use in horticulture and conservation efforts."
