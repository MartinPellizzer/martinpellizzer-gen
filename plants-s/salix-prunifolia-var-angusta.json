    "intro": "Salix prunifolia var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues during the growing season. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
