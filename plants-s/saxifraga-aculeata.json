    "intro": "Saxifraga aculeata, commonly known as the prickly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its numerous stiff, spine-like bracts that surround the flowering stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. Saxifraga aculeata is adapted to cold climates and has a compact growth habit that helps it withstand harsh weather conditions."
