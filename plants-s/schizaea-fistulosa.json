    "intro": "Schizaea fistulosa, commonly known as the pipestem horse-tail, is a member of the family Schizaeaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology. It is a small, perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with upright, segmented stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Schizaea fistulosa is notable for its primitive features and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
