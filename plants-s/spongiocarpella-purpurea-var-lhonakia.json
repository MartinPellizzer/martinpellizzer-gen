    "intro": "Spongiocarpella purpurea var. lhonakia, commonly known as the Tibetan orchid, is a rare and endemic plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple-pink flowers and fleshy, sponge-like roots. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its unique morphology includes elongated leaves and a compact, bulbous structure that helps it store water. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
