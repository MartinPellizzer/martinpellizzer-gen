    "intro": "Sphaeropuntia, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. The stems are typically cylindrical or spherical, often covered in spines that provide protection from herbivores. Sphaeropuntia species produce vibrant flowers, usually in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the spring. Additionally, they bear edible fruits known as tunas, which are used in various culinary applications."
