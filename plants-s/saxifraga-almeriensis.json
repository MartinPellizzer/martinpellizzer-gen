    "intro": "Saxifraga almeriensis, commonly known as Almer\u00eda saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Saxifraga almeriensis is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
