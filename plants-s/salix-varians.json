    "intro": "Salix varians, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its flexible, often pendulous branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix varians is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
