    "intro": "Stellaria media subsp. apetala, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and oval-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The subspecies apetala is distinguished by the absence of petals, giving it a simpler floral structure compared to other members of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
