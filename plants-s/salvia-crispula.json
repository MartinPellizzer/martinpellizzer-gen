    "intro": "Salvia crispula, commonly known as the crinkled sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Salvia crispula is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
