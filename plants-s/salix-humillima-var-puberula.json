    "intro": "Salix humillima var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
