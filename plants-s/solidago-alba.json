It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Solidago alba plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
