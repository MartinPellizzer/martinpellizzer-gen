    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 pseudoedithae, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga \u00d7 pseudoedithae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh, rocky environments."
