    "intro": "Solanum perfidum, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a perennial shrub that produces dark purple berries, which are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids like atropine and scopolamine. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue. Despite its toxic properties, it has been historically used in medicine and magic due to its potent chemical composition."
