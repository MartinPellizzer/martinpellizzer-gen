    "intro": "Sempervivum ciliosum, commonly known as the \"Ciliate Houseleek,\" is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with white-tipped margins that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. Sempervivum ciliosum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions due to its thick, waxy leaves that store water."
