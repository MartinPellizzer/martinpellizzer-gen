    "intro": "Sempervivum adenophorum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with reddish or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Sempervivum adenophorum is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings."
