It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spiny spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife. Sporobolus nealleyi is often found in grasslands and along the edges of deserts."
