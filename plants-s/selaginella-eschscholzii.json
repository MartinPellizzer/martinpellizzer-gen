    "intro": "Selaginella eschscholzii, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, needle-like leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain the spores necessary for propagation. Selaginella eschscholzii is also notable for its ability to survive periods of drought due to its specialized adaptations."
