    "intro": "Salix coluteoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, often forming dense stands. Salix coluteoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
