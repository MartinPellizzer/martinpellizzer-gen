    "intro": "Struthanthus nitidus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in desert or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, arid conditions. Struthanthus nitidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
