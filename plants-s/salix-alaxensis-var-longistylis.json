    "intro": "Salix alaxensis var. longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled willow, is a variant of the Alaska willow. It is a deciduous shrub native to the Yukon and Alaska regions of North America. The plant features slender, often multi-branched stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, with the male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic of wind-pollinated species. This variant is notable for its elongated stigmas, which are adapted for effective pollination in its harsh, arctic environment."
