    "intro": "Solanum acanthoideum, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in stiff, spiny hairs, and its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature, and these berries are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
