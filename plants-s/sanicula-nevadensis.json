    "intro": "Sanicula nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Sanicle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and blooms in early summer. Sanicula nevadensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
