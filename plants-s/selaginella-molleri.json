    "intro": "Selaginella molleri, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of its branches. Selaginella molleri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in arid conditions. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important species in ecological studies and horticulture."
