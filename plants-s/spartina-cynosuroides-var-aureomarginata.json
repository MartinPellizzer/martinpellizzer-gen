    "intro": "Spartina cynosuroides var. aureomarginata, commonly known as golden-margin cordgrass, is a coastal grass species native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, linear leaves with golden-yellow margins. This variety thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomes form dense stands that stabilize sediments and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by reducing erosion and supporting biodiversity."
