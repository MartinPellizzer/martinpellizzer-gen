    "intro": "Saxifraga multifida, commonly known as the notched saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed, hairy leaves that form a dense, low-growing structure. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga multifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
