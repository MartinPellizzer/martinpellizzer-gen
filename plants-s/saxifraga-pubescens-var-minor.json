    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically clustered at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions."
