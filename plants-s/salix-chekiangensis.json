It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
