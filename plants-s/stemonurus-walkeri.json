    "intro": "Stemonurus walkeri, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
