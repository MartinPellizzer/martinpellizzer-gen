    "intro": "Silene perlmanii, commonly known as the Perlman's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. It has narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene perlmanii is considered a rare and endangered species."
