    "intro": "Salix hindsiana var. leucodendroides, commonly known as the white-topped willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white to pale yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and its role in stabilizing stream banks through its extensive root system."
