    "intro": "Scirpus distigmaticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, which are often surrounded by a dense tuft of bristles. Scirpus distigmaticus thrives in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, ponds, and wet meadows. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
