    "intro": "Spiraea gigantea, commonly known as the giant spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its showy, flat-topped clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Spiraea gigantea is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice in landscaping."
