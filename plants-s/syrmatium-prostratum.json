It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often along the stems. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Syrmatium prostratum is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
