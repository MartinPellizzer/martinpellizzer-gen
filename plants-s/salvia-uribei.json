    "intro": "Salvia uribei, commonly known as the Urib\u00e9 sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, rocky habitats. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia uribei is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
