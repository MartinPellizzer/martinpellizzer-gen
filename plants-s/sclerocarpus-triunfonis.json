    "intro": "Sclerocarpus triunfonis, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruit that contains a single seed. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species."
