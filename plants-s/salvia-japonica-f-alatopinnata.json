    "intro": "Salvia japonica f. alatopinnata, commonly known as the Japanese sage or narrow-leaved sage, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a silver-green hue and a distinctive, narrow leaf arrangement. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
