    "intro": "Sphaerocodon angolensis, commonly known as the Angola globe thistle, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape formed by tightly packed, spiny leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Sphaerocodon angolensis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking, compact form."
