    "intro": "Sagina ciliata var. patula, commonly known as silver carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round, dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover plant in gardens and natural landscapes."
