    "intro": "Stelis laminata, commonly known as the lace orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Stelis laminata thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and delicate blooms make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
