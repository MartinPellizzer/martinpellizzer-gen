    "intro": "Salix sungkianica f. brevistachys, commonly known as the short-stalked willow, is a variant of the Sungkian willow native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, clustered catkins. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
