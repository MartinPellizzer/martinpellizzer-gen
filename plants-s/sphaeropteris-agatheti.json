    "intro": "Sphaeropteris agatheti, commonly known as the Agatheti cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to New Caledonia. It is a small, compact cycad with a short, stout trunk and a crown of dense, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
