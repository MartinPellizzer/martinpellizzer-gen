    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos lithophyllus, commonly known as the rock starflower, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed to form a mat. Sphaerostephanos lithophyllus is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates, making it a typical lithophyte."
