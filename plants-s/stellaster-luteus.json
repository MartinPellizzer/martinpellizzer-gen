    "intro": "Stellaster luteus, commonly known as the yellow starburst, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the family Stellasteridae. It is characterized by its star-shaped body with radial symmetry, typically featuring multiple arms radiating from a central disc. The organism is covered in small, calcareous plates that provide structural support and protection. Its coloration is often yellow or orange, which may serve as a warning signal to potential predators. Stellaster luteus is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates."
