    "intro": "Sisymbrium amplexicaule, commonly known as narrowleaf winter cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and alternate, lanceolate leaves that often clasp the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in short, cylindrical pods that dehisce to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Sisymbrium amplexicaule is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
