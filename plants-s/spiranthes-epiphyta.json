    "intro": "Spiranthes epiphyta, commonly known as the common pink spiraea, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in its habitat. Spiranthes epiphyta is often found as an epiphyte on the bark of trees, though it can also grow in soil."
