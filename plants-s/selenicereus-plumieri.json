    "intro": "Selenicereus plumieri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that store water. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only one night before wilting. Its nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular subject for nocturnal gardening and conservation efforts."
