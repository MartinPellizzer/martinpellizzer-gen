    "intro": "Sambucus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces dark purple to black berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. Sambucus chinensis typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
