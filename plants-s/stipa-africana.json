    "intro": "Stipa africana, commonly known as African feather grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of fine, silver-gray foliage that resemble feathers, hence its common name. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements due to their elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Stipa africana is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
