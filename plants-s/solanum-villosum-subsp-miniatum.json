It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
