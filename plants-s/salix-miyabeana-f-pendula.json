    "intro": "Salix miyabeana f. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a light green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often planted for its ornamental value in gardens and along waterways."
