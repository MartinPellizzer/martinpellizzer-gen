    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically grayish-green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
