    "intro": "Stenogyne sherffii, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, attracting native pollinators such as honeycreepers. Stenogyne sherffii thrives in moist, shaded habitats within mesic to wet forests, often growing on rocky slopes or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
