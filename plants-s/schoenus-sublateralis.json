    "intro": "Schoenus sublateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters at the base. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus sublateralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
