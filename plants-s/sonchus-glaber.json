    "intro": "Sonchus glaber, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, and it produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, oval-shaped fruits. The plant is characterized by its soft, green stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in some regions. Sonchus glaber is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
