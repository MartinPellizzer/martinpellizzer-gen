    "intro": "Stenoloma decompositum, commonly known as the decomposing lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is leathery and often has a dark green to blackish upper surface with a white or pale lower surface. It forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for assessing the health of forest ecosystems."
