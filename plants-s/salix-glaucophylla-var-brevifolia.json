    "intro": "Salix glaucophylla var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
