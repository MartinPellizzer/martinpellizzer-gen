    "intro": "Stelis formosa, commonly known as the showy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are ovate and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Stelis formosa is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
