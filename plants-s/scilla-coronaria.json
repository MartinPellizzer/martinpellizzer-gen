    "intro": "Scilla coronaria, commonly known as the crown scilla, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllis family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodland and rocky habitats. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a bell-shaped inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically appearing after the flowers have bloomed. Scilla coronaria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
