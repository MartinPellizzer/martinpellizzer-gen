    "intro": "Scleria setulosa, commonly known as the tufted bulbous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick rhizome with several narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. Its fibrous roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Scleria setulosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
