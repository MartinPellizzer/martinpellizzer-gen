It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a short, rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
