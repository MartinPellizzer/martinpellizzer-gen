    "intro": "Stachys rubisepala, commonly known as the red-sepal stachys, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves with a slightly rough texture, often tinged with reddish hues. Its sepals, which are the outermost parts of the flower, are prominently colored in red, giving it its common name. Stachys rubisepala is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
