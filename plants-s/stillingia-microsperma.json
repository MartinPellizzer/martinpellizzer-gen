    "intro": "Stillingia microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded stillingia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its erect stems, palmate leaves, and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its small, dry seeds are enclosed in a capsule, and the plant is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
