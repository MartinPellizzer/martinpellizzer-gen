    "intro": "Stelis brachiata, commonly known as the aerial orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its stems are typically short and branched, with leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
