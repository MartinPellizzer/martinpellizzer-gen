    "intro": "Sagina decumbens subsp. decumbens, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas, wet meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
