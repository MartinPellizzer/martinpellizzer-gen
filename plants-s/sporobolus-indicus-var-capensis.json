It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals."
