    "intro": "Salacia podostemma, commonly known as the river orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near streams and rivers, often growing along the banks of waterways. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered an important species in the study of plant adaptation and biodiversity."
