    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis var. typica, commonly known as the common sheep's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, reddish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. This species is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
