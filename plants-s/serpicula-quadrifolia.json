    "intro": "Serpicula quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers and trifoliate leaves, though the rare four-leaf variant is highly sought after. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Serpicula quadrifolia is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and healing properties."
