    "intro": "Schismatoglottis beccariana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved schismatoglottis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to pale green hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are typical of the Schismatoglottis genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
