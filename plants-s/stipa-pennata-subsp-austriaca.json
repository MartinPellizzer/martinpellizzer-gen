    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with small, feathery bracts, giving it a delicate, airy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
