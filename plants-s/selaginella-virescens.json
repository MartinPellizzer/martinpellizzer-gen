    "intro": "Selaginella virescens, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique capacity to lose up to 95% of its water content and then revive when rehydrated. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged spirally along the stems. Selaginella virescens is widely studied for its resilience and has applications in biotechnology and ecological research."
