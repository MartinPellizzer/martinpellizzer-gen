    "intro": "Stipa longiglumis, commonly known as the long-awned feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, tufted inflorescences that consist of spikelets with long, silky awns. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Stipa longiglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
