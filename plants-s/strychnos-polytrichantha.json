    "intro": "Strychnos polytrichantha, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
