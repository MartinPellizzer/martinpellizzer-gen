It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody structure. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded habitats within mesic forests.

Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
