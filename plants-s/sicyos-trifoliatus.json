    "intro": "Sicyos trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaved gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features palmately lobed leaves with three to five leaflets, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its stems are hairy and can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to climb and spread vigorously. Sicyos trifoliatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
