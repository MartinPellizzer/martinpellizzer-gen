    "intro": "Sideroxylon cylindrocarpon, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and deep green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its strong, durable timber, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional uses."
