It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shady gardens."
