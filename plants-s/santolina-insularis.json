    "intro": "Santolina insularis, commonly known as the island santolina, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage with a compact, rounded form, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are borne on branched stems. Santolina insularis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, requiring well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
