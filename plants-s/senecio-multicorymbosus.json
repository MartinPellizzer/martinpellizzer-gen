    "intro": "Senecio multicorymbosus, commonly known as the many-corymbose ragwort, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers arranged in corymbs, which are flattened, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in regions with poor soils. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance."
