    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rubra var. pubescens, commonly known as the red willow, is a hybrid species native to parts of western North America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This willow typically grows along stream banks and moist soils, thriving in riparian habitats. Its flowers are catkins, which are grouped in clusters and appear in early spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
