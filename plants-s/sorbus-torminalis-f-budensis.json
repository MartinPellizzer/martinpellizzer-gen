    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. budensis, commonly known as the Budensis whitebeam, is a rare horticultural form of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its distinctive white, fuzzy appearance on the fruiting bodies, which sets it apart from the typical greenish or reddish fruits of the species. This form is typically found in cultivation rather than in the wild, and it is prized for its ornamental value. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub with simple, alternate leaves. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes."
