It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color and produce small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological importance. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
