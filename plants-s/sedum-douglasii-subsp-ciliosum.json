It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
