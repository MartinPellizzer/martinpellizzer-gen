    "intro": "Selaginella rubricaulis var. angolensis, commonly known as the Angola clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, cushion-like rosette of leaves, which are usually dark green with a reddish hue on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. This species is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique morphological adaptations to its habitat."
