    "intro": "Stylosanthes hamata, commonly known as the hairy stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branching habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing oval seeds. It is widely used as forage for livestock due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. Stylosanthes hamata also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for sustainable agriculture."
