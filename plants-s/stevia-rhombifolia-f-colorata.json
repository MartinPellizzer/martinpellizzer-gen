It is characterized by its distinctive, colorful foliage, which can range from pink to red, making it visually striking. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is a perennial herb that thrives in warm, sunny climates and well-drained soil. While it shares the sweet taste of other stevia species, its ornamental value makes it popular in gardens and as a decorative plant."
