    "intro": "Sideritis tragoriganum subsp. mugronensis, commonly known as Mugron Mountain Sideritis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
