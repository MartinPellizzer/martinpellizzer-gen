    "intro": "Schwantesia constanceae, commonly known as the Constancia's schwantesia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of many bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink or red. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schwantesia constanceae is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
