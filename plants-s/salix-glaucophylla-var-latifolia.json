    "intro": "Salix glaucophylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the glaucophylla willow species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western regions of North America. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish or grayish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands. The flowers are catkins, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
