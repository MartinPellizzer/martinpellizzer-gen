    "intro": "Schefflera elegans, commonly known as the velvetleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, palmate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera elegans is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
