    "intro": "Samara sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower samara, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its most distinctive feature is the samara fruit, a dry, winged seed pod that aids in wind dispersal. This botanical trait contributes to its ecological role in forest understories and disturbed habitats."
