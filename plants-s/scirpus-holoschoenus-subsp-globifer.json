    "intro": "Scirpus holoschoenus subsp. globifer, commonly known as the globeflower bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base."
