    "intro": "Styphelia planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form, and it produces delicate white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Styphelia planifolia is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in native garden landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
