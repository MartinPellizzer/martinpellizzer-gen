It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate and delicate floral structure.

Its flowers are usually small, fragrant, and come in shades of white and yellow, making it a unique addition to the region's flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
