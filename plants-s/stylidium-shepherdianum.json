It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble those of the crocus. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in coastal and inland regions. Its unique structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and a short, erect stem bearing the showy inflorescence. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions."
