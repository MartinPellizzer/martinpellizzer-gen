It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that bear clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is lance-shaped and often has a slightly hairy texture. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
