    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. glauca, commonly known as white meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, fluffy flowers that appear in early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a bluish-green hue, giving the plant its 'glauca' variety name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
