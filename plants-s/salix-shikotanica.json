    "intro": "Salix shikotanica, commonly known as the Shikotan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
