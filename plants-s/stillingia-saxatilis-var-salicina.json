    "intro": "Stillingia saxatilis var. salicina, commonly known as the Pacific red root, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
