It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with three prominent veins running from the base to the tip. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that contain edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Syndyophyllum trinervium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
