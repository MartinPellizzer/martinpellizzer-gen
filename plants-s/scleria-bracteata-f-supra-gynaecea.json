    "intro": "Scleria bracteata f. supra-gynaecea, commonly known as the broad-leaved spearplant, is a variant of the species Scleria bracteata, belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The 'supra-gynaecea' form refers to the position and structure of its reproductive organs, which are notably elevated and prominent."
