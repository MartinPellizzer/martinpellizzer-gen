    "intro": "Styrax jucundus, commonly known as the sweet styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance in perfumery. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a glossy appearance. Styrax jucundus typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
