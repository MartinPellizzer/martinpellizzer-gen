    "intro": "Sphaerocionium vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Sphaerocionium vestitum is native to Central and South America but has been introduced to other tropical regions. It plays a role in both ecological systems and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation."
