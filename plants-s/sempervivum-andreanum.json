    "intro": "Sempervivum andreanum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the Pyrenees region. It features rosettes of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" which grow around the base of the parent plant, forming dense clusters. Its flowers are typically pink or red, emerging from the center of the rosette in the spring. Sempervivum andreanum is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth and low maintenance requirements."
