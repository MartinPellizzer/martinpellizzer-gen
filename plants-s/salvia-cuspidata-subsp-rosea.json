It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant, rose-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Salvia genus, sharing similar growth habits and aromatic properties. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild, thyme-like fragrance."
