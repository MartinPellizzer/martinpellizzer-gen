    "intro": "Sporobolus rigidus var. rigidus, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, rigid stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils."
