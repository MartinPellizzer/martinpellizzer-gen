    "intro": "Stenoloma aculeatum, commonly known as the spiky fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, spiky fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture that aids in water retention."
