    "intro": "Siphoneugena angustifolia var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf siphoneugena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool and humid conditions."
