    "intro": "Serapias parviflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sandwort, is a rare and striking variant of the serapias genus. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast sharply with its green, succulent leaves. Native to the limestone soils of southern Europe, this plant thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its compact growth habit and unique floral coloration make it a notable addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts. The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
