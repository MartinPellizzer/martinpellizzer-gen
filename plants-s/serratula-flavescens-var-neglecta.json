    "intro": "Serratula flavescens var. neglecta, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a perennial weed native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and competitive nature make it a problematic invasive species in many areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its robust root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
