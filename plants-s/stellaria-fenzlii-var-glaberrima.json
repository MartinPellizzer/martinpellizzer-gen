    "intro": "Stellaria fenzlii var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often covered with fine hairs, though the variety glaberrima is distinguished by its smoother foliage. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
