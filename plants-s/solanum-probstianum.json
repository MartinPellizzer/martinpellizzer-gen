    "intro": "Solanum probstianum, commonly known as the Probstian nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is typically found in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It is a herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
