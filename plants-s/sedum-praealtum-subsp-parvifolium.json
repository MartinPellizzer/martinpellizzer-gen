    "intro": "Sedum praealtum subsp. parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves for survival. This species is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
