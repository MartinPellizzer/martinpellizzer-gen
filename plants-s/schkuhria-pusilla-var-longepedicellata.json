    "intro": "Schkuhria pusilla var. longepedicellata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into slender, elongated seed heads. Its unique botanical characteristics include elongated pedicels, which distinguish it from other varieties of Schkuhria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
