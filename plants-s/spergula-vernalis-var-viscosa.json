    "intro": "Spergula vernalis var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are linear and typically covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The flowers are usually greenish or pale yellow, and the plant is known for its ability to colonize disturbed or wetland habitats."
