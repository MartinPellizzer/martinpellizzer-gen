    "intro": "Sorbus colchica, commonly known as the Colchic whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
