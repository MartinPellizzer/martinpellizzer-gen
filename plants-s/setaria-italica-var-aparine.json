    "intro": "Setaria italica var. aparine, commonly known as prickly millet, is a variant of millet characterized by its bristly, rough texture. It is a grass species native to warm climates and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive, serrated edge, while the stems are often covered in stiff, prickly hairs. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and nutritional value."
