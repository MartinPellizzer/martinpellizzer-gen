    "intro": "Salvia drymocharis, commonly known as the mountain sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
