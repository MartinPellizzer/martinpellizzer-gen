    "intro": "Scleranthus pleiotomus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Scleranthus pleiotomus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
