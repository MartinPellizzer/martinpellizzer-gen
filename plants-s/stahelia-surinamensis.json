It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat head, and bloom during the wet season. Stahelia surinamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
