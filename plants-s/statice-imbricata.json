    "intro": "Statice imbricata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to maritime environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Statice imbricata is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its long-lasting flowers and drought-resistant nature."
