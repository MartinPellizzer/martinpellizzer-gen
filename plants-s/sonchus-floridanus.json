    "intro": "Sonchus floridanus, commonly known as Florida sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive bluish-green color, while its yellow flowers bloom in the summer. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
