    "intro": "Scytalis tenuis var. oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf scytalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
