    "intro": "Senegalia petrensis, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, which can remain on the plant for extended periods. Senegalia petrensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
