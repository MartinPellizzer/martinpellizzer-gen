    "intro": "Solanum filirhachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers, which are followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
