    "intro": "Steffensia glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf steffensia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
