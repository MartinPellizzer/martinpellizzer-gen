It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plants typically grow in wet, swampy areas and are often found in the southeastern United States. Stenomesson species have strap-like leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological role in wetland habitats."
