It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are often arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it a unique and striking appearance.
