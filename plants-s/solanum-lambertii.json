    "intro": "Solanum lambertii, commonly known as Lambert's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
