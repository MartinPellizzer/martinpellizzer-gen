    "intro": "Sorbus latifolia var. parumlobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
