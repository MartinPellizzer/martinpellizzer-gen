    "intro": "Sedum engleri, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to China. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. Sedum engleri is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant landscaping option."
