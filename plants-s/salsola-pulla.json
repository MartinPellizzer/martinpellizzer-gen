    "intro": "Salsola pulla, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Eurasia but has been introduced to various parts of the world, often becoming an invasive species. It thrives in disturbed soils and arid environments, making it a common weed in agricultural and roadside areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging plant to control."
