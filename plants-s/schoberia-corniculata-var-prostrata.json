    "intro": "Schoberia corniculata var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is often found in desert scrub and limestone habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
