    "intro": "Sorengia caricoides, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence is a spike-like structure with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Sorengia caricoides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
