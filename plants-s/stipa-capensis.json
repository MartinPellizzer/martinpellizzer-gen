    "intro": "Stipa capensis, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Stipa capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
