    "intro": "Saussurea serrata var. contracta, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its ecological significance and medicinal importance, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
