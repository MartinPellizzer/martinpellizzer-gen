    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh environments, such as tundra and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats to retain heat and moisture. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is distinguished by its pale-colored flowers, which contrast with the more commonly found pink or red blooms of the species."
