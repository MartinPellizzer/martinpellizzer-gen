    "intro": "Selaginella schottmuelleri, commonly known as the Schottm\u00fcller's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on rocky or sandy soils. This plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained substrates. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Selaginella schottmuelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
