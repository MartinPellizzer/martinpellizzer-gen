    "intro": "Sonchus ciliatus var. subbipinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are edible when young but become bitter and less palatable as they mature. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
