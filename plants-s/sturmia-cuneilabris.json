    "intro": "Sturmia cuneilabris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sturmia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Sturmia cuneilabris thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
