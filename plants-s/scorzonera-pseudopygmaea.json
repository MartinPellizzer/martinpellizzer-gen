    "intro": "Scorzonera pseudopygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf scorzonera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Scorzonera pseudopygmaea is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
