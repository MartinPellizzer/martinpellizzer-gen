    "intro": "Sorbus oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, orange-red berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in forested areas and along stream banks. Sorbus oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
