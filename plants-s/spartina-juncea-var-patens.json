It thrives in brackish and saline environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Spartina juncea var. patens plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
