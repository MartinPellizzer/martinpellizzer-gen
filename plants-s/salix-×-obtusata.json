    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 obtusata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a hybrid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it useful for erosion control and reforestation projects."
