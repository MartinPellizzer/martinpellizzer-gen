    "intro": "Stipa rhizomata, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It forms dense, clump-like tufts or tussocks, which help it thrive in various grassland and steppe environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation and contribute to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil. Stipa rhizomata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion."
