    "intro": "Sinningia floribunda, commonly known as the violet bell, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant violet or purple flowers that resemble small bells. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sinningia floribunda is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
