    "intro": "Smilax hookeri, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and cling to supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax hookeri thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps, and it plays a role in providing food and shelter for various animals."
