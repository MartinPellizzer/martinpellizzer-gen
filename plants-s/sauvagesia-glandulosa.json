It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and may aid in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
