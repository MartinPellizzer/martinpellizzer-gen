    "intro": "Sonchus lampsanoideus, commonly known as the broadleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
