It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes."
