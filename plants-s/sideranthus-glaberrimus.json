    "intro": "Sideranthus glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth bushveld clover, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, grassy habitats and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Sideranthus glaberrimus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
