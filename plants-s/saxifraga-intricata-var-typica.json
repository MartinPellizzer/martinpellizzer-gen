It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically succulent, with a textured surface that aids in water retention in its harsh environment."
