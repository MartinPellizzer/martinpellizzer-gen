    "intro": "Solanum ruiz-lealii, commonly known as the Ruiz-Leal's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are usually violet or blue in color, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
