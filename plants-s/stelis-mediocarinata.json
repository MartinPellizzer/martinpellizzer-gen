    "intro": "Stelis mediocarinata, commonly known as the medium-ribbed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale yellow. Stelis mediocarinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
