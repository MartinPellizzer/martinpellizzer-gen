It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Its flowering stems are usually short and clustered, giving it its common name. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
