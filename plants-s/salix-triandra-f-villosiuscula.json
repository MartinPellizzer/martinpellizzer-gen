    "intro": "Salix triandra f. villosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is adapted to wetland environments. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this botanical variant."
