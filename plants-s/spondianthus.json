It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their dense, spiny foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to yellow. Spondianthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. They are also adapted to poor soils and can be found in rocky or coastal habitats."
