It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which are followed by yellow berries that contain the toxic seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The species is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
