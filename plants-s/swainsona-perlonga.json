    "intro": "Swainsona perlonga, commonly known as the longpod swainsona, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seed pods are elongated and cylindrical, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind. Swainsona perlonga is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to store water in its stems."
