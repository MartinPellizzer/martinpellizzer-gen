    "intro": "Siphocampylus avicularis, commonly known as the slenderleaf siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
