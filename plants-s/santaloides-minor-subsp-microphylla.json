    "intro": "Santaloides minor subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in nutrient cycling."
