    "intro": "Sarracenia drummondii var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf trumpet pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that form deep, tubular pitchers designed to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with intricate patterns that aid in attracting prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. This variety is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique ecological adaptations."
