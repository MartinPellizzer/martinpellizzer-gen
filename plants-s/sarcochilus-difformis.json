It features a distinctive, hairy rhizome and produces showy, helmet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually borne on erect, branched stems and bloom from late autumn to early spring. Sarcochilus difformis is known for its variability in flower size and color, making it a popular subject for botanical study."
