    "intro": "Saurauia portachuelensis, commonly known as the Portachuelensis stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Spain. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
