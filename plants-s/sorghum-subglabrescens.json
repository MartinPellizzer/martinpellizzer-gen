    "intro": "Sorghum subglabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species. Sorghum subglabrescens is often used for forage and has potential applications in biofuel production."
