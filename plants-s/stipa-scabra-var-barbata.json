    "intro": "Stipa scabra var. barbata, commonly known as the barbed feathergrass, is a variant of the slender wheatgrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and distinctive, barbed awns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelets that are often wind-dispersed. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
