    "intro": "Syringa \u00d7 dichroa, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping viburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established. Syringa \u00d7 dichroa is often used in landscaping for its elegant, flowing appearance and seasonal color changes."
