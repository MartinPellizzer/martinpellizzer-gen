    "intro": "Seticereus ferrugineus, commonly known as the Red-Flowered Cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to desert conditions."
