    "intro": "Solanum pelagicum, commonly known as the sea tomato, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in saline environments. Solanum pelagicum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
