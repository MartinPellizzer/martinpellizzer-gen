    "intro": "Sparaxis cana, commonly known as the rain lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. Sparaxis cana is also valued for its ability to bloom during the rainy season, adding a burst of color after periods of drought."
