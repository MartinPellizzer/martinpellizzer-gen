    "intro": "Senecio patens var. prenanthoidea, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
