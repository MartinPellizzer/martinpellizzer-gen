It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.
