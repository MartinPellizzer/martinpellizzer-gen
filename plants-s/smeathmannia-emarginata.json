It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in long strips. The leaves are lance-shaped, usually grey-green in color, and have a smooth margin. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
