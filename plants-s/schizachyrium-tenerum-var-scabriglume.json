    "intro": "Schizachyrium tenerum var. scabriglume, commonly known as rough glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and wet meadows. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and the inflorescence consists of small, bract-like structures. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems and its use in native plant landscaping."
