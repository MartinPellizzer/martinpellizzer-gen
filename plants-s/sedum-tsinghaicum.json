It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
