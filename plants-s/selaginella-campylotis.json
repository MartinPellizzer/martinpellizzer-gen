    "intro": "Selaginella campylotis, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its wiry, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella campylotis is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
