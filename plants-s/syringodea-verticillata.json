It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, contributing to its creeping growth habit. Its leaves are typically small and lance-shaped, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Syringodea verticillata is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
