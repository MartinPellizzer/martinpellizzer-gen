    "intro": "Solanum juciri var. inermis, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
