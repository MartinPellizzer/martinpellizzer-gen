    "intro": "Stephanachne pappophorea var. monandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
