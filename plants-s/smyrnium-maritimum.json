    "intro": "Smyrnium maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along the shorelines. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiky pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Smyrnium maritimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects."
