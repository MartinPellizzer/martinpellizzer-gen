    "intro": "Senecio tournefortii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry, open habitats. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and can survive in harsh desert environments. Senecio tournefortii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
