    "intro": "Solanum muansense, commonly known as the Muansense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it bears berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum muansense is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Due to its toxic properties, it is rarely cultivated and is more often found in wild or semi-wild habitats."
