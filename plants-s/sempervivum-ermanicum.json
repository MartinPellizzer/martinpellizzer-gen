    "intro": "Sempervivum ermanicum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and can thrive in full sun. Sempervivum ermanicum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
