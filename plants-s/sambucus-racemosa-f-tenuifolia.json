    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender elderberry, is a herbaceous perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and slightly serrated, and its clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is distinct from the more common Sambucus racemosa due to its narrower leaves and smaller, more delicate flowers."
