    "intro": "Senecio adnivalis var. erioneuron, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
