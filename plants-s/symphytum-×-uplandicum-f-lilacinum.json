    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 uplandicum f. lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-flowered comfrey, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lilac-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is perennial and thrives in moist, fertile soil, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. It has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine for its healing properties. Its rapid growth and ability to accumulate heavy metals make it useful for phytoremediation."
