It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that remain on the plant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Symplocos sempervirens is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
