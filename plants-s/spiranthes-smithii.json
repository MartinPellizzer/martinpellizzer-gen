    "intro": "Spiranthes smithii, commonly known as the Smith's spiral orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with three sepals and three petals, and it lacks a visible labellum. Spiranthes smithii is often found in association with other orchid species and plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and moths."
