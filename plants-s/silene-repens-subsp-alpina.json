    "intro": "Silene repens subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine flax or alpine bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. Silene repens subsp. alpina is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
