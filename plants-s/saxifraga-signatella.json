    "intro": "Saxifraga signatella, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, providing protection against intense sunlight and cold. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in early summer, and are arranged in tight clusters. Saxifraga signatella is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, often growing in crevices or on slopes where other plants struggle to thrive."
