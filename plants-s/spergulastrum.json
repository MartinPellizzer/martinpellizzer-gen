    "intro": "Spergulastrum, commonly known as sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Spergulastrum has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
