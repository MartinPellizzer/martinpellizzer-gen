    "intro": "Sceptridium californicum, commonly known as the California clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many primitive plants. Sceptridium californicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
