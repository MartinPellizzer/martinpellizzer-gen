    "intro": "Sphaerostigma campestre var. mixtum, commonly known as the mixed form of the common sphaerostigma, is a variant of the sphaerostigma genus native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical or nearly spherical fruiting bodies that develop from the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy surface, while the stems are slender and creeping. This variant is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and as a food source for various insect species."
