It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. The subspecies is distinguished by its relatively large, fleshy fruits and seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals."
