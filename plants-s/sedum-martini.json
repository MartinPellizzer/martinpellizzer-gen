    "intro": "Sedum martini, commonly known as \"Martin's stonecrop,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum martini is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
