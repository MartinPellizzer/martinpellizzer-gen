    "intro": "Siolmatra mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican siolmatra, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Siolmatra mexiae is considered a species of conservation concern."
