    "intro": "Salvia lateriflora, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Salvia lateriflora is also known for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance for wet conditions."
