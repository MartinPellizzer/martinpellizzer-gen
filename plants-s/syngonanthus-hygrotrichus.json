    "intro": "Syngonanthus hygrotrichus, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in swampy or marshy areas. Syngonanthus hygrotrichus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
