    "intro": "Scrophularia gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in calcium-rich soils, particularly on gypsum or limestone substrates, and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Scrophularia gypsicola is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, known for its ornamental and sometimes medicinal properties."
