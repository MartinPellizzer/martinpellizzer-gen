    "intro": "Stenogyne kipahuluensis, commonly known as the Kipahulu ironwood, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the rainforest. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, with five petals that are usually white or pale pink in color. Stenogyne kipahuluensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is considered a keystone species for certain pollinators and native fauna."
