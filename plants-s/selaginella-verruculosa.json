    "intro": "Selaginella verruculosa, commonly known as the velvet spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage is particularly notable for its elongated, spore-bearing structures called strobila. Selaginella verruculosa is also known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water retention mechanisms."
