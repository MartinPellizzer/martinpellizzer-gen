    "intro": "Salicornia iranica subsp. sinus-persica, commonly known as Persian glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils, showcasing its ability to thrive in high-sodium conditions. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, scale-like leaves are clustered around the nodes, and it produces tiny, green flowers in dense clusters. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
