    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 meikleana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix cinerea and Salix lanata. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate environments. The plant features slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, woody fruits. Salix \u00d7 meikleana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate wet conditions."
