    "intro": "Salix rosmarinifolia var. tungbeiana, commonly known as the Tungbeian willow, is a variant of the rosmarinifolia willow native to China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green on the upper surface and silvery-white on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical fruits that release tiny seeds. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges."
