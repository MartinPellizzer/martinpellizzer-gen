    "intro": "Salvia melissifolia, commonly known as lemon beebrush, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees and other pollinators, contributing to ecological biodiversity. Salvia melissifolia is also valued for its use in traditional herbal medicine."
