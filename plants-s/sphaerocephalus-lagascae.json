    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus lagascae, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sphaerocephalus lagascae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
