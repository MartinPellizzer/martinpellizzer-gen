    "intro": "Stangea henrici, commonly known as the Henry's stangea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Stangea henrici is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
