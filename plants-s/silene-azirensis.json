    "intro": "Silene azirensis, commonly known as the Azirian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Silene azirensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
