    "intro": "Setaria viridis var. depressa, commonly known as dwarf green millet, is a compact, annual grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, spreading stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
