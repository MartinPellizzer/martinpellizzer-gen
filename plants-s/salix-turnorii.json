    "intro": "Salix turnorii, commonly known as Turnor's willow, is a rare and woody shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside, and it produces small catkins during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix turnorii is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and conservation studies."
