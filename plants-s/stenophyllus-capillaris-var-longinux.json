    "intro": "Stenophyllus capillaris var. longinux, commonly known as the long-stemmed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, elongated inflorescences. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, panicle-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted for wind pollination, with lightweight seeds that disperse easily. This variety is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
