    "intro": "Santalodes indutum, commonly known as the smooth sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. Its wood is aromatic and has been traditionally used in incense and perfumery. The species is also valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
