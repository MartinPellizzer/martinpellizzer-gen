It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional Chinese medicine, though further research is needed to validate its therapeutic uses. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
