    "intro": "Spatalla caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth texture. It has a milky sap that can be toxic, which serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
