It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum pulligerum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it ideal for low-water landscapes."
