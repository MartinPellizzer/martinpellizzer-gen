    "intro": "Sagina ammannioides, commonly known as sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its compact growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in rocky or sandy landscapes. Sagina ammannioides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
