    "intro": "Silene elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene elongata is often found in open meadows and is an important part of the flora in its native ecosystems."
