    "intro": "Siliquaria glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular siliquaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods called siliques, which are covered in small glands. These glands secrete a sticky substance that aids in seed dispersal. Siliquaria glandulosa is typically found in moist, sandy soils in coastal regions."
