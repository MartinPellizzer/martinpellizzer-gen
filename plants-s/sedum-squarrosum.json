    "intro": "Sedum squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosy stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial succulent with fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
