    "intro": "Sorghastrum micratherum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
