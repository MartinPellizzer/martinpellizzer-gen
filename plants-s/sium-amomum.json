    "intro": "Sium amomum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils along stream banks and lake shores. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that attract pollinators. Sium amomum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
