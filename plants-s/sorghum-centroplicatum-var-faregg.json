    "intro": "Sorghum centroplicatum var. faregg, commonly known as the African millet, is a drought-tolerant grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, hard grains that are rich in nutrients and have been used as a food source for both humans and animals. It thrives in poor soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its resilience, it is an important crop in regions with limited water resources."
