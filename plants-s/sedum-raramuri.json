    "intro": "Sedum raramuri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and usually yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Sedum raramuri is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
