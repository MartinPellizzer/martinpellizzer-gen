    "intro": "Stomatium patulum, commonly known as the broad-mouthed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive, wide mouth-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted by their fragrance and nectar."
