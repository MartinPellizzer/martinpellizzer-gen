It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, loose spikelets that are often pink or reddish in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
