    "intro": "Sabicea mollissima, commonly known as the silky sabicea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red as it matures. Sabicea mollissima is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth."
