    "intro": "Salix paraplesia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a variant of the paraplesia willow native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color and appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
