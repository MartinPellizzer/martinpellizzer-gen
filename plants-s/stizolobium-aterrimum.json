It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a rough or hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Stizolobium aterrimum is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
