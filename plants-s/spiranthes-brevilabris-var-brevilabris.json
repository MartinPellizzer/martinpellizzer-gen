    "intro": "Spiranthes brevilabris var. brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, slender, leafless stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
