    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 lapczynskii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra, characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
