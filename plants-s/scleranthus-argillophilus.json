    "intro": "Scleranthus argillophilus, commonly known as the clay-loving thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or red, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Scleranthus argillophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and supports local insect populations."
