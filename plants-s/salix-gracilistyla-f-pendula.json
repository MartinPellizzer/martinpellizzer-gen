    "intro": "Salix gracilistyla f. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a unique variant of the willow tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This ornamental tree is native to China and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its slender, pendulous branches create a delicate, flowing appearance, making it a popular choice for landscaping. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green color that turns yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, contributing to its ecological value by providing nectar for pollinators."
