    "intro": "Sorbus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its ornamental, spire-like clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges. Sorbus orientalis is valued in horticulture for its attractive form and seasonal interest."
