    "intro": "Salix muscina, commonly known as the bog willow, is a shrub native to wetland and swampy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect species. Salix muscina is also valued for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a key component of peatland ecosystems."
