    "intro": "Statice pinifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Pacific. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, hence its species name *pinifolia*. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Statice pinifolia is often used in ornamental gardening and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
