    "intro": "Swintonia acuminata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Swintonia acuminata is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
