    "intro": "Saxifraga glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in glandular dots, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Saxifraga glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh environments."
