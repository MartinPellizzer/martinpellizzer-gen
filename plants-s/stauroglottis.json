    "intro": "Stauroglottis, commonly known as the starry glottis or false thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Stauroglottis species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to thrive in dry conditions. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, such as Stauroglottis ciliata, which is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East."
