    "intro": "Sphenotoma squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose sphenotoma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences. The plant features a short, stout stem with a rosette of waxy, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish in color, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphenotoma squarrosa is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
