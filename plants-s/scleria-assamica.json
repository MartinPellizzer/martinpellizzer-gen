    "intro": "Scleria assamica, commonly known as the Assam arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and flowering heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Scleria assamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
