    "intro": "Spiranthes porrifolia, commonly known as the marsh ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, spiraling white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown seed pods that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
