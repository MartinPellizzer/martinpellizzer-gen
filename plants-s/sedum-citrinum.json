    "intro": "Sedum citrinum, commonly known as lemon sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green but can turn reddish in response to sunlight or stress. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum citrinum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
