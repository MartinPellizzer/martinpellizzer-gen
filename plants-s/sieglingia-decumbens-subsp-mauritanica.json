    "intro": "Sieglingia decumbens subsp. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania Sieglingia, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage in its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
