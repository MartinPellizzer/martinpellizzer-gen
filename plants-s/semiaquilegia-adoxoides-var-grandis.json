    "intro": "Semiaquilegia adoxoides var. grandis, commonly known as the large-flowered water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with prominent central stamens, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
