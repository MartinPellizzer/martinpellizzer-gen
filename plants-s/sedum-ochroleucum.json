    "intro": "Sedum ochroleucum, commonly known as the white-flowered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it a versatile addition to many landscapes."
