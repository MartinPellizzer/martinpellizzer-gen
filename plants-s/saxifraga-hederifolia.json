    "intro": "Saxifraga hederifolia, commonly known as the ivy-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that resemble ivy leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Saxifraga hederifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to spread vigorously."
