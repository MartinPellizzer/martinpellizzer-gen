    "intro": "Sida truncata, commonly known as rough sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, white to pale purple flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sida truncata is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
