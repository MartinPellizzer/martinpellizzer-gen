    "intro": "Sideroxylon jubilla, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard, and durable wood, which is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Sideroxylon jubilla is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
