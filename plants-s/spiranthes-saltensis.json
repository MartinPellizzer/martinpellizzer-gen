    "intro": "Spiranthes saltensis, commonly known as the Salt Marsh Ladies' Tresses, is a rare orchid native to coastal areas of the northeastern United States. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, showcasing its adaptation to high-salinity environments. The plant produces intricate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate beauty to its habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
