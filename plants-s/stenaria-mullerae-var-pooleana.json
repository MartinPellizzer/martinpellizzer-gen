    "intro": "Stenaria mullerae var. pooleana, commonly known as the Poole's stenaria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. The flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
