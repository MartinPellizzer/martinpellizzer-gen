    "intro": "Senecio aberdaricus, commonly known as the Aberdare senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Aberdare Range in Kenya. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Senecio aberdaricus thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, often growing in open, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
