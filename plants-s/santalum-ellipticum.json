    "intro": "Santalum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to eastern Australia. It is a hemi-parasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and fine woodwork. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal habitats."
