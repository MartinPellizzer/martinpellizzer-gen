    "intro": "Strychnos palembanica, commonly known as the Palembang strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
