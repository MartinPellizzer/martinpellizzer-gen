    "intro": "Sibbaldiopsis tridentata f. hirsutifolia, commonly known as the hairy trident honeysuckle, is a variant of the trident honeysuckle, characterized by its hairy foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America, typically found in moist woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that attracts birds and other wildlife. The hairy texture of its leaves distinguishes this form from the typical variety, making it a unique botanical specimen."
