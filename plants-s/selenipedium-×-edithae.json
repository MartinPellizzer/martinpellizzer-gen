    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 edithae, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is a hybrid between Selenipedium albidum and Selenipedium australianum, two species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It grows as an epiphytic plant, often found clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
