    "intro": "Syzygium pyrocarpum, commonly known as the fireseed tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, round, red or orange berries that are encased in a hard, woody shell. These berries are typically consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
