    "intro": "Selleola ekmaniana, commonly known as the Ekmans' fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selleola ekmaniana is considered a species of conservation concern."
