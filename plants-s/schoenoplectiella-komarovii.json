It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of lakes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
