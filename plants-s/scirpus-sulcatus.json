    "intro": "Scirpus sulcatus, commonly known as the ridge marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-parted flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus sulcatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
