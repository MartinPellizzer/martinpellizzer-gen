    "intro": "Seseli montanum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf mountain seseli, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
