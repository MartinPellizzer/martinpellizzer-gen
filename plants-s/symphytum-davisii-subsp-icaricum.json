    "intro": "Symphytum davisii subsp. icaricum, commonly known as the Icaric Mountain Pimpernel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and small, violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats. It is often found in high-altitude environments, where it contributes to the local flora's diversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
