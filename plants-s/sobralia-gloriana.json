    "intro": "Sobralia gloriana, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange inflorescences that resemble a torch. The plant features strap-like leaves and produces showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sobralia gloriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
