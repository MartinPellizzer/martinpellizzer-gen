It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
