    "intro": "Schoenus pedicellatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
