    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum subsp. yanacochense, commonly known as the Yanacocha potato, is a wild potato species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, typically growing in the cool, moist climates of the Andes. Its tubers are generally small and have a distinct flavor compared to cultivated potatoes. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving potato resilience and yield."
