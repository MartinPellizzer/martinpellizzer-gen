    "intro": "Scirpus holoschoenus subsp. euholoschoenus, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern Australia. It typically grows in dense tussocks, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy areas, marshes, and the margins of lakes and rivers. This subspecies is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
