    "intro": "Scleranthus cinereus, commonly known as the gray sandwort, is a flowering plant native to dry, sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green or grayish leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in loose inflorescences, and bloom in early summer. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and gravelly areas due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. The plant's fibrous root system helps stabilize loose soils, making it ecologically significant in arid environments."
