    "intro": "Stellaria fenzliana, commonly known as the Fenzli's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Stellaria fenzliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
