    "intro": "Silaus besseri, commonly known as the Mongolian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silaus besseri is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
