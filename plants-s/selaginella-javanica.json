    "intro": "Selaginella javanica, commonly known as the Javan spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella javanica exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
