It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing yellowish to golden florets, which give it its common name. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
