It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to specific alpine regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments with low temperatures and limited nutrients. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is considered a subject of interest in botanical research."
