    "intro": "Salaxis mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius salax, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
