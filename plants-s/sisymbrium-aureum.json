    "intro": "Sisymbrium aureum, commonly known as yellow mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and have a slightly bitter taste due to the presence of glucosinolates. The seeds are small, pale brown, and are often used in mustard condiments."
