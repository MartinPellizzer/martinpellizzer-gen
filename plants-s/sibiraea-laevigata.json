    "intro": "Sibiraea laevigata, commonly known as the smooth sibiria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in subalpine and alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Sibiraea laevigata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
