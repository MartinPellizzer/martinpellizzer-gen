    "intro": "Saxicolella futa, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique species that thrives in harsh, rocky environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. The plant's structure is typically crust-like, forming a dense, cohesive layer on rock surfaces. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and provides habitat for microorganisms. Due to its specialized adaptations, Saxicolella futa is often found in arid and mountainous regions."
