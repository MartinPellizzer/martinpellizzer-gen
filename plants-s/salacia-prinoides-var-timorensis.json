    "intro": "Salacia prinoides var. timorensis, commonly known as the Timor salacia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
