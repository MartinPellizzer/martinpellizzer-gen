    "intro": "Stipa chrysophylla var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf golden feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that add a striking visual element to its appearance. The plant typically reaches a height of no more than 30 centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight curl at the tips, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
