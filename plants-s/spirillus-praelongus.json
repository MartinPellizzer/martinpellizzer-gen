    "intro": "Spirillus praelongus, commonly known as the long spiral spirillum, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its spiral-shaped, thread-like structure. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant's elongated, coiled form allows it to maximize surface area for photosynthesis. Spirillum praelongus is known for its ability to absorb nutrients efficiently from the surrounding water. It plays a role in maintaining water clarity by filtering out suspended particles."
