    "intro": "Solidago humilis var. abbei, commonly known as the dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly rough texture. This variety is well adapted to moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
