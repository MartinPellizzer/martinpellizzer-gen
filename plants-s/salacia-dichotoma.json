    "intro": "Salacia dichotoma, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale green, leafless stems that resemble the branches of a tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the canopy of the forest. Salacia dichotoma is adapted to low light conditions and is often found growing on other trees, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for ecological and horticultural study."
