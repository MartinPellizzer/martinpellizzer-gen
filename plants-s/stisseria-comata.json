    "intro": "Stisseria comata, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on erect, hairy stems. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. Stisseria comata is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
