    "intro": "Syzygium littorale, commonly known as the coastal tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, woody pods containing several seeds. Syzygium littorale thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in mangrove or coastal forest ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
