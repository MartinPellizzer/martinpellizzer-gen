    "intro": "Silphium simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's compassplant, is a perennial herb native to the tallgrass prairies of the central United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, spiky flower head that resembles a compass, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. Silphium simpsonii is valued for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a key component of native plant communities."
