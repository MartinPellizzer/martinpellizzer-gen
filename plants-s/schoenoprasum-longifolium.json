    "intro": "Schoenoprasum longifolium, commonly known as long-leaved chervil, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used as a culinary herb, similar to parsley and dill, and are valued for their delicate, anise-like flavor. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
