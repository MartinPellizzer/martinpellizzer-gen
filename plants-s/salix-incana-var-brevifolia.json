    "intro": "Salix incana var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and more densely arranged than those of other willow species. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its catkins are a distinguishing feature, with male and female flowers appearing on separate branches. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
