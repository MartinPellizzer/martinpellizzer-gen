    "intro": "Santalum pyrularium, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. Santalum pyrularium is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its wood is highly valued for its fragrant, durable timber used in traditional and contemporary crafts."
