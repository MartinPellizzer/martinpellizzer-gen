    "intro": "Solanum undatum var. aurantiacum, commonly known as the golden nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
