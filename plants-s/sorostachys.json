It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences that resemble miniature umbrellas, often with bright red or orange bracts. The plants are typically annuals or short-lived perennials, growing in dry, disturbed soils across various regions. They have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers.
