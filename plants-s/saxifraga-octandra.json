    "intro": "Saxifraga octandra, commonly known as the eight-angled saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptical, hairy leaves and stems that bear clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Saxifraga octandra is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
