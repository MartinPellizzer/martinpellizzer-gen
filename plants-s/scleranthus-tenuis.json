    "intro": "Scleranthus tenuis, commonly known as slender false flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Scleranthus tenuis is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects."
