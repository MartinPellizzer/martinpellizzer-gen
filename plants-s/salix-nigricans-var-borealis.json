    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and catkin flowers, which are typical of willow species. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its stems and leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variant is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures."
