    "intro": "Sapindus rarak, commonly known as the Indian soapberry tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. Its most notable botanical feature is the fruit's ability to produce a soapy lather when crushed, making it useful for natural cleaning purposes."
