It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with five distinct veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
