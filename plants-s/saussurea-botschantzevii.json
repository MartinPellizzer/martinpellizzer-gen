    "intro": "Saussurea botschantzevii, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with minimal rainfall. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
