    "intro": "Sabulina tortumensis, commonly known as the Tortumense sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Caucasus region. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, arranged in a tight cluster at the center of the rosette. Its flowering stems are typically shorter than the leaves, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Sabulina tortumensis is a rare and specialized species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
