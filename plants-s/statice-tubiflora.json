    "intro": "Statice tubiflora, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Statice tubiflora is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
