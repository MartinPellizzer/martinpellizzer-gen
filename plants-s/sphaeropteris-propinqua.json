    "intro": "Sphaeropteris propinqua, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, leathery, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, and has a slow growth rate. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture. Sphaeropteris propinqua is well adapted to dry, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
