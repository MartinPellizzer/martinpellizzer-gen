    "intro": "Sparganium minimum var. oligocarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur-pot, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its fruiting structures, called burrs, are distinctive for their spiky, cone-like appearance and contain seeds that are dispersed by water. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
