    "intro": "Sloanea minima, commonly known as the dwarf sloanea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Sloanea minima is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and cloud forests. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation and as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
