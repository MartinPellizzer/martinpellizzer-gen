    "intro": "Sagittaria cuneata f. equiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are broad and often floating or submerged, with a distinctive notched base. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life."
