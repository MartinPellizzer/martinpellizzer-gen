    "intro": "Siphocampylus phyllobotrys f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered form of the silver leaf sage, is a unique variant of the parent species. It is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy foliage and pale to white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical green-flowered form. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking contrast between the silver leaves and the pale blooms."
