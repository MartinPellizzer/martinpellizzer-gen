    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tarvitaensis, commonly known as the Tarvitaensis bulbous cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of pale green to yellowish spines. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Sulcorebutia tarvitaensis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
