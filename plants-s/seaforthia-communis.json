    "intro": "Seaforthia communis, commonly known as the coastal bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the western coast. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that helps reflect sunlight. Seaforthia communis plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
