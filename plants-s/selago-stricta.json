    "intro": "Selago stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved selago, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Selago stricta produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
