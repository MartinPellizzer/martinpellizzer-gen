    "intro": "Sorghastrum scaberrimum, commonly known as rough sorgum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and erect, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
