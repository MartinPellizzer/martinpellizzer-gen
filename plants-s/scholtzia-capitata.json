    "intro": "Scholtzia capitata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep taproot system that allows it to access groundwater. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Scholtzia capitata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and open plains."
