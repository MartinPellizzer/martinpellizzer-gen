    "intro": "Stigmatodon sanctateresensis, commonly known as the Santeresense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and fleshy, disc-shaped bodies that attach to host trees. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows on the branches of tropical trees such as *Pterocarpus* and *Cecropia*. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
