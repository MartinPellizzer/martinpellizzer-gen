It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing bristly, awned florets. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. This variant is distinguished by its finely scabrous leaf surfaces and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
