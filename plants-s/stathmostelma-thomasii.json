    "intro": "Stathmostelma thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas's stathmostelma, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with a spreading root system that helps it anchor in rocky or clay soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
