It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems."
