    "intro": "Suaeda tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sea-blite, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are usually clustered in racemes, and it is often found in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. Suaeda tomentosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
