    "intro": "Sarcoglottis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered sarcoglottis, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its modified leaves that form a spadix and a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Sarcoglottis micrantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
