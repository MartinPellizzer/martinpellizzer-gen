    "intro": "Solanum schimperianum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It features small, egg-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe, are edible but contain toxic compounds. This species is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
