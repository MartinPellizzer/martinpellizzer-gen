It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and small, yellowish to brownish flower heads. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
