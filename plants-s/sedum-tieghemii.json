    "intro": "Sedum tieghemii, commonly known as the Texas stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and rocky environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
