    "intro": "Stichorkis elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stichorkis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, elliptic-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Stichorkis elliptica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions."
