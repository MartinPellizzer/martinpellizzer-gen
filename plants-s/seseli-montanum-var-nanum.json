    "intro": "Seseli montanum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf mountain seseli, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing no taller than 30 centimeters, with slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
