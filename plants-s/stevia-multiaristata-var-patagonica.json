    "intro": "Stevia multiaristata var. patagonica, commonly known as Patagonian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its low water requirements and medicinal properties, it has gained interest as a sustainable alternative to sugar."
