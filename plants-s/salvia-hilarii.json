    "intro": "Salvia hilarii, commonly known as the Hilari's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, woody structure and vibrant violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia hilarii is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
