    "intro": "Saxifraga porophylla var. stribrnyi, commonly known as the stribrnyi saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
