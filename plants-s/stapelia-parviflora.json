    "intro": "Stapelia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Stapelia parviflora is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
