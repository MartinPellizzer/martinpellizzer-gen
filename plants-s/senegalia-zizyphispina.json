    "intro": "Senegalia zizyphispina, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is well-known for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Senegalia zizyphispina is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
