    "intro": "Sensitiva pudica, commonly known as the shrinking plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is a climbing vine that features heart-shaped leaves which fold inward when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant's stems are slender and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The botanical interest in Sensitiva pudica lies in its unique thigmonastic response, which is a form of plant movement triggered by touch."
