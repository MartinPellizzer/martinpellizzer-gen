    "intro": "Solanum aculeatissimum var. hispidissimum, commonly known as the hispid nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by livestock and humans alike."
