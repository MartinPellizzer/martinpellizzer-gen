    "intro": "Solanum citrifolium, commonly known as the lemonleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often yellowish-green and have a citrus-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. Solanum citrifolium is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
