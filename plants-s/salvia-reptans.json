    "intro": "Salvia reptans, commonly known as carpet sage, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant features narrow, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia reptans is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
