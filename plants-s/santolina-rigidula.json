    "intro": "Santolina rigidula, commonly known as rigid santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, aromatic leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
