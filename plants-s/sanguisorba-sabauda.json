It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, slightly sour flavor, making it a useful plant in culinary applications. Sanguisorba sabauda is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
