It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, translucent bladders used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in wetland environments, where it thrives in shallow, still water. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. This variety is notable for its specialized adaptations to aquatic life and its role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
