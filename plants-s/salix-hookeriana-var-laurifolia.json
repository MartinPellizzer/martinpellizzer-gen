    "intro": "Salix hookeriana var. laurifolia, commonly known as the Hooker's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
