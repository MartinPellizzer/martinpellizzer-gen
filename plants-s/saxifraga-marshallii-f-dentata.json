    "intro": "Saxifraga marshallii f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Asia. It features rosettes of ovate, toothed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
