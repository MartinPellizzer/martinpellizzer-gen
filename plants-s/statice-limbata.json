    "intro": "Statice limbata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice limbata is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in dried flower arrangements."
