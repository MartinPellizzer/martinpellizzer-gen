It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is an annual plant that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
