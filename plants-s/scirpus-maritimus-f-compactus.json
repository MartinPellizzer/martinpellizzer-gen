    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus f. compactus, commonly known as the compact bulrush, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. This plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in marshes and tidal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it an effective stabilizer of shorelines and a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in coastal restoration projects."
