    "intro": "Shoubiaonia, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to East Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. Its root system is specialized to attach to the roots of host plants, allowing it to absorb water and minerals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
