    "intro": "Salvia lasiocephala, commonly known as the woollyhead sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its adaptability to arid conditions and ornamental value make it a valued addition to native plant gardens."
