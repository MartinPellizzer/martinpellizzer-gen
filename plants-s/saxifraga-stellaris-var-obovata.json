    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. obovata, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of oval, dark green leaves that are slightly rounded at the ends, giving it the varietal name *obovata*. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. Saxifraga stellaris var. obovata is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh weather conditions."
