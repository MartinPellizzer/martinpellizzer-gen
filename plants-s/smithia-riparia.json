    "intro": "Smithia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and stream edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bell-shaped, blue to purple in color, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Smithia riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
