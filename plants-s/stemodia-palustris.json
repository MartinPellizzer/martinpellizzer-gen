    "intro": "Stemodia palustris, commonly known as swamp stemodia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, supporting small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and are usually pale green to white in color. Stemodia palustris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
