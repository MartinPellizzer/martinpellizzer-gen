    "intro": "Struthiopteris membranacea, commonly known as the membranous shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The spore-producing sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family."
