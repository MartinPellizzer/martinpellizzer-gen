It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy or rocky shorelines. Statice elata is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and attractive, long-lasting blooms."
