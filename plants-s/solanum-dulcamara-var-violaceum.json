    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. violaceum, commonly known as the purple bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to purple, often with a white throat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The berries that follow the flowers are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the genus."
