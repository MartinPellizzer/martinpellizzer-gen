    "intro": "Schoenus tendo subsp. achaetus, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 1 cm wide, giving it a distinct appearance. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
