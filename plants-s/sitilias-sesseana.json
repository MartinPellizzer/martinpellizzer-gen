    "intro": "Sitilias sesseana, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, providing it with its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded environments. Sitilias sesseana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
