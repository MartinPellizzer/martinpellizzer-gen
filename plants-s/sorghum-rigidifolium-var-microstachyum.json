    "intro": "Sorghum rigidifolium var. microstachyum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a compact, drought-tolerant grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, rigid leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny grains. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it suitable for small-scale cultivation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
