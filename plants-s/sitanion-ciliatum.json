    "intro": "Sitanion ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has finely divided, hair-like leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Sitanion ciliatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water filtration."
