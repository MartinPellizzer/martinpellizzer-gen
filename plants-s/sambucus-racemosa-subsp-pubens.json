    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa subsp. pubens, commonly known as the downy elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and a fuzzy, downy texture on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared properly before consumption. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value in gardens."
