    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. arenarium, commonly known as the sand sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in coastal areas, sand dunes, and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
