    "intro": "Silene acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant or sea pink, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has dense, compact growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Silene acaulis is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
