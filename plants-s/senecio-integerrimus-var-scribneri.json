    "intro": "Senecio integerrimus var. scribneri, commonly known as the Scribner's Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is a perennial herb that produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a composite head, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
