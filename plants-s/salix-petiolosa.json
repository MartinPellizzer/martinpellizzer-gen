    "intro": "Salix petiolosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long. The leaves are usually green on top and hairy underneath, with a distinctive petiole that is longer than the leaf blade. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the plant's primary means of reproduction. This species is often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands."
