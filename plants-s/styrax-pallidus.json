    "intro": "Styrax pallidus, commonly known as the pale styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Styrax pallidus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
