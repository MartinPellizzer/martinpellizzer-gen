    "intro": "Sanguisorba taurica, commonly known as the Caucasian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content. Sanguisorba taurica is often found in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
