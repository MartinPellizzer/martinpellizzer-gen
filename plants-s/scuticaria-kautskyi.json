    "intro": "Scuticaria kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky's scuticaria, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Scuticaria kautskyi is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
