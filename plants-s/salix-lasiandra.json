    "intro": "Salix lasiandra, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high elevations. Salix lasiandra is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
