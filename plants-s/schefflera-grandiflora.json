    "intro": "Schefflera grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera grandiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
