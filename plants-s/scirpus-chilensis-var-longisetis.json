    "intro": "Scirpus chilensis var. longisetis, commonly known as the long-haired bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stem, which are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with long, silky hairs along the edges. This variety is commonly found in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
