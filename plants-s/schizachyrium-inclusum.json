    "intro": "Schizachyrium inclusum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and woodland habitats. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and coppery red stems, which turn golden in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with feathery plumes, enhancing its ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Schizachyrium inclusum plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance in native plant communities."
