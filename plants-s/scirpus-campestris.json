    "intro": "Scirpus campestris, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of the stem, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Scirpus campestris thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
