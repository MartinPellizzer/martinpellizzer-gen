    "intro": "Salix caerulea, commonly known as the blue willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-blue, contributing to its common name. Salix caerulea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to cold, dry climates."
