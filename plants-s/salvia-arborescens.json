    "intro": "Salvia arborescens, commonly known as the autumn sage, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, blooming from late summer into early autumn. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its leaves are gray-green and fuzzy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. Salvia arborescens is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds."
