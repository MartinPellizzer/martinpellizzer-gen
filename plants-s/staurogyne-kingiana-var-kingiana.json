    "intro": "Staurogyne kingiana var. kingiana, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It has broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable aquatic plant for water gardens and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
