    "intro": "Senecio infiernillensis, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
