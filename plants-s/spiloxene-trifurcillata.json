    "intro": "Spiloxene trifurcillata, commonly known as the three-branched spiloxene, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its delicate, glandular-hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are linear and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Spiloxene trifurcillata is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
