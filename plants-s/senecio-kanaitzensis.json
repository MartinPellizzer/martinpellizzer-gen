    "intro": "Senecio kanaitzensis, commonly known as the Kanaitzen's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
