    "intro": "Stipa glabrata, commonly known as the smooth feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, with a bluish-gray hue, and the inflorescence is composed of multiple spikelets arranged in a loose, open cluster. Stipa glabrata is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
