    "intro": "Spathiphyllum huberi, commonly known as the Huberi peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Philippines. It features broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces elegant white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate watering to maintain its health. Spathiphyllum huberi is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
