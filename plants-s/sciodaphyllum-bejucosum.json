    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum bejucosum, commonly known as the silverleaf mahogany, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and dark, glossy leaves that reflect light, giving it its common name. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable species in ecological and historical contexts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Sciodaphyllum bejucosum is now classified as endangered."
