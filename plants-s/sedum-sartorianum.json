    "intro": "Sedum sartorianum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Sedum sartorianum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its ornamental appeal."
