    "intro": "Solanum cardiophyllum var. pliozygum, commonly known as the Pliozygum nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its distinctive foliage and flowering patterns. This plant typically features broad, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The fruit, which is a berry, contains seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp, a common feature among solanaceous plants. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts may contain harmful alkaloids."
