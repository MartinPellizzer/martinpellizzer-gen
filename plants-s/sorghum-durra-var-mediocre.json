    "intro": "Sorghum durra var. mediocre, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a lesser-known variant of the sorghum genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stalks compared to other sorghum species. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to brownish flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy crop in regions with limited water availability. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional agriculture and for forage purposes."
