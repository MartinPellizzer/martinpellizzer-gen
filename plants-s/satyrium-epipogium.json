    "intro": "Satyrium epipogium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are not true flowers but are instead specialized vegetative organs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
