    "intro": "Sisymbrium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant has pinnately divided, serrated leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its seeds are enclosed in a long, slender pod that splits open when mature to release the tiny, oblong seeds. Sisymbrium dentatum is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
