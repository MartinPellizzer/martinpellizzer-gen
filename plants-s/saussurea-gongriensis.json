    "intro": "Saussurea gongriensis, commonly known as the Gongri saffron plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense, yellowish-orange flower heads. The plant is adapted to cold and arid environments, with a short growing season and specialized root systems to anchor it in rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a distinctive, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in alpine ecosystems."
