    "intro": "Syzygium alatum, commonly known as the winged starfruit, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are often winged along the edges. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible yellow-orange fruits resembling small starfish. Its fruit is valued for its sweet, aromatic pulp and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Syzygium alatum thrives in humid, warm climates and is typically found in lowland rainforests."
