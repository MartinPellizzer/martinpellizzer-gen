    "intro": "Steiropteris comosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Steiropteris comosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
