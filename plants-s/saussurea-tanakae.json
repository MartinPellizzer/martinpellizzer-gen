    "intro": "Saussurea tanakae, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh mountainous conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which reduces water loss. Saussurea tanakae is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan medicine."
