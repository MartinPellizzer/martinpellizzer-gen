    "intro": "Stuckenia filiformis var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine threadwater plant, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its slender, thread-like stems are often submerged in water, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
