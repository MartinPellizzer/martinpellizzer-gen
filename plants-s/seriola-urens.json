    "intro": "Seriola urens, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans, if ingested. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Seriola urens plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
