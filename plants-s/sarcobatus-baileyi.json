    "intro": "Sarcobatus baileyi, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sarcobatus baileyi is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
