    "intro": "Solidago angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and narrow, often with a slightly hairy texture. Solidago angustifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
