    "intro": "Sambucus verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. Sambucus verrucosa thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas. Its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine make it a notable botanical species."
