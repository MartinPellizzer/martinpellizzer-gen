It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in spring, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. Solanum impediens belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
