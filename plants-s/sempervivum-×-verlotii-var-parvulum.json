    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 verlotii var. parvulum, commonly known as the compact snowflake, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is a low-growing species, usually reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and alpine gardens."
