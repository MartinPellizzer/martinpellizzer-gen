    "intro": "Saracha ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Saracha ferruginea is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and has a shallow root system that allows it to absorb water efficiently."
