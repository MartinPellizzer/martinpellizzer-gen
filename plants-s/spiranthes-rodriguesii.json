    "intro": "Spiranthes rodriguesii, commonly known as Rodrigues spiraea, is a rare orchid species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, slender stem that bears the floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
