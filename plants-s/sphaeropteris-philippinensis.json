    "intro": "Sphaeropteris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant features a short, stout trunk with a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically borne on the trunk and are either male or female. Sphaeropteris philippinensis is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils."
