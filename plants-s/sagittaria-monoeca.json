    "intro": "Sagittaria monoeca, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a water-loving herbaceous plant native to wetlands and shallow aquatic environments. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are present on the same individual. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Sagittaria monoeca is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various water conditions."
