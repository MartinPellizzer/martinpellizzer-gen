    "intro": "Solanum kitivuense, commonly known as the Kitivu nightshade, is a shrub native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
