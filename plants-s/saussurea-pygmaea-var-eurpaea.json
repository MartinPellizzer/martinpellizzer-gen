    "intro": "Saussurea pygmaea var. eurpaea, commonly known as the European pygmy saffron, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with a dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and high UV exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
