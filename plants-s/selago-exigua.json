    "intro": "Selago exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Selago exigua is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects in desert environments."
