It features woody stems that are often covered in a milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, clustered in umbels, and attract various pollinators. Stemodia suffruticosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
