    "intro": "Sophronitis colnagoi, commonly known as the Colnago's orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green tones. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sophronitis colnagoi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
