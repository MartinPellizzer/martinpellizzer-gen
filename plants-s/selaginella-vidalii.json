    "intro": "Selaginella vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, which are typical of the spore-bearing plants in the genus Selaginella. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ability to survive in arid conditions makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant resilience and adaptation."
