It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bead-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
