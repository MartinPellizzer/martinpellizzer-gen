    "intro": "Schefflera stellulata, commonly known as the star-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a radial pattern, enhancing its visual appeal. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Schefflera stellulata is valued for its adaptability and ability to tolerate low light conditions."
