    "intro": "Specklinia leontoglossa, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hairy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that resemble small leopards. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and it blooms during the wet season. Specklinia leontoglossa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for under the right conditions."
