    "intro": "Serapias dafnii, commonly known as the Dafni's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its vibrant, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple markings. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Serapias dafnii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
