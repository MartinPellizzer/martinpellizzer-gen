    "intro": "Salpinctium, commonly known as the thimbleweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, thimble-like seed heads that give it its common name. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Salpinctium species are native to North America and are often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. They are known for their showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months."
