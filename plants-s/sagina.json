    "intro": "Sagina, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Sagina species are typically found in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
