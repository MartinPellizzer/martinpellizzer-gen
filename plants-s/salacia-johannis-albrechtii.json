    "intro": "Salacia johannis-albrechtii, commonly known as the Johannis-Albrechtii salacia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that display a vibrant mix of yellow and orange hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and glossy, providing a lush green backdrop to its showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
