    "intro": "Solanum meloncillo, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a shrub native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and elliptical, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids in their unripe form. It thrives in dry, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided as a food source."
