    "intro": "Schizodium obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often exhibit a zigzag or undulating growth pattern. The plant produces small, narrow leaves with a slightly rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. Schizodium obliquum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and wetland habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
