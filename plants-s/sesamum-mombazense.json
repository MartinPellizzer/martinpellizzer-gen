It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat, brown seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Sesamum genus."
