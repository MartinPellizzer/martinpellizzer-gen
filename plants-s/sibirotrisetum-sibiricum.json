    "intro": "Sibirotrisetum sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are typically arranged in loose clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Sibirotrisetum sibiricum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal in cooler climates."
