    "intro": "Styphelia pallens, commonly known as the pale mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. Styphelia pallens typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense, mat-like appearance."
