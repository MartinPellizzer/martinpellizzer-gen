    "intro": "Sparganium natans var. submuticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant features long, flexible stems that float on the water surface, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. Its most distinctive feature is the cylindrical, spiky inflorescence that develops at the tips of the stems, which contains small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in still or gently flowing water, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems."
