    "intro": "Solanum dulcamaroides, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial vine native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a bright red, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
