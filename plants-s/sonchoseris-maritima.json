    "intro": "Sonchoseris maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, adapting well to harsh coastal environments. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its flowers are blue to purple in color, resembling holly leaves. It produces small, spherical seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardening. Sonchoseris maritima is valued for its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
