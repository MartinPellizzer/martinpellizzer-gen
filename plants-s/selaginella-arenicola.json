    "intro": "Selaginella arenicola, commonly known as the sand spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Due to its ability to survive in extreme conditions, Selaginella arenicola is often used in xerophytic gardens and as a specimen plant in arid landscapes."
