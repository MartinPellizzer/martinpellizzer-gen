    "intro": "Selaginella zenkeri, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. It possesses a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and fire, due to its capacity to resprout from its rhizomes. Selaginella zenkeri plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
