    "intro": "Solanum suberosum var. ramosivelutinum, commonly known as the hairy branched nightshade, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
