    "intro": "Sorbus polgariana, commonly known as the Polgarian rowan, is a species of shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and colorful fruits, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
