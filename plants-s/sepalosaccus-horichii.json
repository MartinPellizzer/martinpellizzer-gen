It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sepals are modified into sac-like structures, which give it its scientific name. The flowers are often pale blue or white, with a distinctive throat that attracts pollinators like butterflies and moths."
