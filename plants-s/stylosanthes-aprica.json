    "intro": "Stylosanthes aprica, commonly known as the golden stylo, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is often used in forage systems due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Stylosanthes aprica is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
