    "intro": "Stipa hirsuta, commonly known as hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Stipa hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
