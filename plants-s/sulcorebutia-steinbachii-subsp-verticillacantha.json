    "intro": "Sulcorebutia steinbachii subsp. verticillacantha, commonly known as the Shrub Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. This resilient cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
