    "intro": "Struthiopteris plumieri, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, herbaceous fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The fronds are typically composed of a central axis with multiple leaflets, showcasing complex vascular structures typical of ferns."
