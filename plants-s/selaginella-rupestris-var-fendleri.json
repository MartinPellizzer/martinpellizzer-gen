    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other organisms. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
