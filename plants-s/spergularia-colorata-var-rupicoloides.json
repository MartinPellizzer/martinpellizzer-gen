    "intro": "Spergularia colorata var. rupicoloides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a succulent structure that helps it retain moisture. It is often found in coastal areas and on cliffs, where it can withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its botanical features make it a hardy species well-suited to disturbed or nutrient-poor soils."
