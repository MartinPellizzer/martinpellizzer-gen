    "intro": "Stipa kralifii, commonly known as the Kralifii needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa kralifii is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, contributing to the ecological stability of these regions."
