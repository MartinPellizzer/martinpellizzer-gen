    "intro": "Sigesbeckia droseroides, commonly known as the sticky false Venus flytrap, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous-like traits, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
