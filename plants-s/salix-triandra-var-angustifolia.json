    "intro": "Salix triandra var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
