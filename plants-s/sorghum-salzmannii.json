It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow, bluish-green leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in dryland ecosystems."
