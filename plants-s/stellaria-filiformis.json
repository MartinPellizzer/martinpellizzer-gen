    "intro": "Stellaria filiformis, commonly known as slender starwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, giving it its common name. The plant has thin, thread-like stems and leaves that are typically opposite and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Stellaria filiformis is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
