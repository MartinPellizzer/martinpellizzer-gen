These plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers and distinctive, often spiky fruits. They are typically deciduous shrubs or small trees, native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Staphylea species often have alternate, simple leaves and produce latex-like sap. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and floral displays."
