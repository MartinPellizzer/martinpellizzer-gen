It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth along the edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Salix \u00d7 norvegica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
