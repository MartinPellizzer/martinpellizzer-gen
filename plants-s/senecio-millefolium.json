    "intro": "Senecio millefolium, commonly known as common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and root fragments. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation."
