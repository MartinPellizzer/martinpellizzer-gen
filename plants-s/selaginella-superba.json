    "intro": "Selaginella superba, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its leaves contain specialized structures called stomata that facilitate gas exchange. Selaginella superba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
