    "intro": "Salix sessilifolia var. villosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
