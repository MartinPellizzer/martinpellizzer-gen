    "intro": "Salix rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Salix rosmarinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
