    "intro": "Sychnosepalum, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial herbs, with long, narrow leaves and clustered inflorescences. Sychnosepalum species are prized for their vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species are threatened with extinction."
