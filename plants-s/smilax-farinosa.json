    "intro": "Smilax farinosa, commonly known as the rough smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in woodland and scrub habitats. Smilax farinosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also a food source for various wildlife species."
