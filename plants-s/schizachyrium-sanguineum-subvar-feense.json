    "intro": "Schizachyrium sanguineum subvar. feense, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender culms that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces fluffy, red-tipped panicles in late summer, which are both ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a valuable plant for erosion control and natural landscaping."
