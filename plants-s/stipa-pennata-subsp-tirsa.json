    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. tirsa, commonly known as the Tirsa needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, which are a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
