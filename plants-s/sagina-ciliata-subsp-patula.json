    "intro": "Sagina ciliata subsp. patula, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
