    "intro": "Sporobolus asper var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
