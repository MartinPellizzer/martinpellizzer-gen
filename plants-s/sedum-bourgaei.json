    "intro": "Sedum bourgaei, commonly known as the \"blue sedum,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping."
