    "intro": "Suttonia kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai's ghost orchid, is a rare and critically endangered plant endemic to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble small orchids. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, typically on the branches of trees in moist, shaded environments. Suttonia kauaiensis is known for its limited distribution and is found only in a few isolated locations on the island. Due to habitat loss and other threats, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
