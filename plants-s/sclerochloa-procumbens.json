    "intro": "Sclerochloa procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, wiry stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. Sclerochloa procumbens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry conditions."
