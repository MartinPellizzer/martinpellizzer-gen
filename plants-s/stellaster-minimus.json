    "intro": "Stellaster minimus, commonly known as the small starburst sea star, is a species of sea star found in shallow marine environments. It belongs to the family Asteriidae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped body with short, tapering arms. The plant, more accurately a marine invertebrate, has a radial symmetry and a calcareous skeleton that provides structural support. Its coloration can vary, often appearing in shades of brown or purple, depending on its habitat. Stellaster minimus plays a role in its ecosystem by feeding on bivalves and contributing to the trophic dynamics of its environment."
