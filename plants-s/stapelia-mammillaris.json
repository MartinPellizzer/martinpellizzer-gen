    "intro": "Stapelia mammillaris, commonly known as the milkweed stapelia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny, leaf-like structures. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinators, which are flies. Stapelia mammillaris is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
