    "intro": "Stellaria borealis f. apetala, commonly known as the Arctic starflower, is a rare variant of the starflower species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and delicate, lanceolate leaves. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its flowers typically bloom in early summer, and the plant is often found in open tundra or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
