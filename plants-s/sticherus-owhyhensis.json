    "intro": "Sticherus owhyhensis, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizome is short and stout, with numerous roots that help anchor it in the soil. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
