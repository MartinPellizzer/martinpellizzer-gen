    "intro": "Sunipia saccata, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often have a saccate (sac-like) appearance, giving it its scientific name. Sunipia saccata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
