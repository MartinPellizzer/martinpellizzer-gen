It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open areas such as dunes, roadsides, and disturbed sites. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
