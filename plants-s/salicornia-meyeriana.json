    "intro": "Salicornia meyeriana, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often red or pink in color, which help it store water and resist desiccation. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature that minimizes water loss in arid conditions. Salicornia meyeriana plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
