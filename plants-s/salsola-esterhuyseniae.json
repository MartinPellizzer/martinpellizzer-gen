The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and stabilize sandy soils. Salsola esterhuyseniae is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
