    "intro": "Saussurea kai-alpina, commonly known as the alpine saffron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a striking display of color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
