    "intro": "Stenia palorae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its root system is specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its fragile nature and specific habitat requirements, Stenia palorae is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
