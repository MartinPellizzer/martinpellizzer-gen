    "intro": "Steganotaenia, commonly known as the \"starfruit\" or \"carambola,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and features distinctive, five-lobed fruits that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and the fruit develops from the ovary of the female flower. Steganotaenia species are valued for their ornamental value and their edible, star-shaped fruits."
