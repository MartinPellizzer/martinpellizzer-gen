    "intro": "Swida monbeigii var. xanthotricha, commonly known as the yellow-haired swida, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, yellowish-brown pubescent foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. The flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale yellow, and appear in the spring."
