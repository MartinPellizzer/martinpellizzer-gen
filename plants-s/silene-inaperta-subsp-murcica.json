It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grayish leaves and small, pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
