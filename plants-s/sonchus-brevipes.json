    "intro": "Sonchus brevipes, commonly known as the shortfoot sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its small yellow flowers are grouped in clusters called heads, which are surrounded by a single layer of bracts. Sonchus brevipes is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
