    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rarissima, commonly known as the rare willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a pale underside. Due to its limited natural range and low seed production, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
