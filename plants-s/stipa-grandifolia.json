    "intro": "Stipa grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-green plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with long, feathery bristles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Stipa grandifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
