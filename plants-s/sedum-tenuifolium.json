    "intro": "Sedum tenuifolium, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted for water storage. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
