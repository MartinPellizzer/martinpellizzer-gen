    "intro": "Sorbus oligodonta var. oligodonta, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
