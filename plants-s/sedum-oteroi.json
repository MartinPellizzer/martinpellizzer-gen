It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum oteroi is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators."
