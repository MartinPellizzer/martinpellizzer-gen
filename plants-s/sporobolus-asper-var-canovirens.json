It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a characteristic feature of many grasses in its habitat. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in native plant landscaping."
