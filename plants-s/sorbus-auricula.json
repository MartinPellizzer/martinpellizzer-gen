    "intro": "Sorbus auricula, commonly known as the auricled rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ear-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake as it ages. Sorbus auricula is often found in woodland edges and moist, shaded areas, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
