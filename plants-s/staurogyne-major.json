    "intro": "Staurogyne major, commonly known as the broadleaf water clover, is a aquatic plant native to the Neotropical region. It is characterized by its floating, leaf-like structures that are divided into small, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are often submerged, and it can form dense mats on the water surface. Staurogyne major is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
