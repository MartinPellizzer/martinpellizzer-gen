    "intro": "Saxifraga rivularis f. hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, moist environments such as mountain streams and alpine meadows. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Saxifragaceae family. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with poor soil, showcasing its resilience to extreme environmental conditions."
