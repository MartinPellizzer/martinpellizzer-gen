    "intro": "Siphocampylus veteranus, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Siphocampylus veteranus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
