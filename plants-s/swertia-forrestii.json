    "intro": "Swertia forrestii, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Swertia forrestii is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan medicine."
