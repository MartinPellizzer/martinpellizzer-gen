It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. The plant produces small, often yellow or white flowers and has hairy, glandular leaves. Its fruit is typically small, round, and resembles a miniature eggplant, with a tough, inedible skin. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than its domesticated counterpart, Solanum melongena, but is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles."
