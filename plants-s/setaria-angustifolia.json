    "intro": "Setaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf foxtail, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and spikelets that form a cylindrical panicle. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are followed by bristly spikelets that disperse seeds effectively. Setaria angustifolia is an annual plant that plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
