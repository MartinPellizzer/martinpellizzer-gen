    "intro": "Salvia polyadenia, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long blooming period. Salvia polyadenia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
