    "intro": "Solanum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. The plant's resilience to drought makes it an important component of its native ecosystem."
