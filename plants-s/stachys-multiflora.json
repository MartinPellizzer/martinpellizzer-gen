    "intro": "Stachys multiflora, commonly known as woodland betony, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its showy, violet-blue flowers are arranged in whorls along the upper stem, blooming from late spring to early summer. Stachys multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
