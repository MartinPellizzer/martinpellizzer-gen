    "intro": "Spiranthes llaveana, commonly known as the Llave's spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The genus Spiranthes is known for its unique floral structure, which resembles a spiral, and Spiranthes llaveana is no exception."
