    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous stigmaphyllon, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in axillary inflorescences. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Stigmaphyllon dichotomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
