    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 lemoinierianum, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, spider-like flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
