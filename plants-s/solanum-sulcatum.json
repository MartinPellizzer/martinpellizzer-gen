    "intro": "Solanum sulcatum, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a waxy coating, and its stems are often marked with distinctive grooves. The fruit is toxic and contains alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution."
