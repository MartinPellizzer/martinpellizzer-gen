    "intro": "Spiraea banatica, commonly known as the Banat spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Balkan region. It features upright, slender stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and showy floral display."
