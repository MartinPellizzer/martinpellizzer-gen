    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. jenisseensis, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Russia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, arctic or subarctic environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has adapted to low light conditions and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is notable for its role in stabilizing soils in permafrost regions and its use in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
