    "intro": "Santaloides afzelii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its wood is aromatic and has been used traditionally in incense and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered in many areas."
