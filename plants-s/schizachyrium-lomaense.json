    "intro": "Schizachyrium lomaense, commonly known as Loma grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are often inconspicuous and not showy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Schizachyrium lomaense is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
