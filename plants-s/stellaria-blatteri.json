    "intro": "Stellaria blatteri, commonly known as the Blatter's starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has delicate, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
