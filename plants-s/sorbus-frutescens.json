    "intro": "Sorbus frutescens, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, rounded foliage with small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white, flat-topped flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
