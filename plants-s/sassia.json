    "intro": "Sassia, commonly known as the marshmallow plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is often found in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Sassia species are known for their mucilage-rich stems, which have been used traditionally in herbal remedies. These plants play an important role in supporting local biodiversity and are often part of wetland ecosystems."
