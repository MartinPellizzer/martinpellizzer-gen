    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. subserrata, commonly known as the serrated rowan, is a botanical variant of the common rowan tree. It is characterized by its serrated leaf margins, which distinguish it from the typical smooth-edged leaves of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often growing in forested areas and mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
