    "intro": "Selliguea obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flat, leaf-like body with a central midrib and small, lobed leaves along its edges. Selliguea obtusa reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Its morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in moist ecosystems."
