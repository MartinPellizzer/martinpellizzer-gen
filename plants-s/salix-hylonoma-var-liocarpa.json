It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often exfoliating to reveal a reddish inner layer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
