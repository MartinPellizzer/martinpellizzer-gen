    "intro": "Schinziella, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically have woody stems and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Schinziella species are often found in rocky or coastal habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Their flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
