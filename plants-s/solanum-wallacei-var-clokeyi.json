    "intro": "Solanum wallacei var. clokeyi, commonly known as Wallace's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often green when mature, though they may change color as they ripen. It is often found in humid, lowland areas and is adapted to thrive in shaded environments. Due to its unique flowering behavior and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
