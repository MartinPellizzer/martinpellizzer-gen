    "intro": "Saxifraga montana f. platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features succulent, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with flat petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
