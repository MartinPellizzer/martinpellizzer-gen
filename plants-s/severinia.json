    "intro": "Severinia, commonly known as the snowberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Severinia buergeriana, which is native to East Asia. The plants are shrubs that typically grow in temperate climates and are characterized by their small, white or pinkish flowers. Their berries, which are often white or yellow, are a distinguishing feature and can persist on the plant throughout the winter. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
