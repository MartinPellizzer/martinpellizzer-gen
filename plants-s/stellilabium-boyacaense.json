    "intro": "Stellilabium boyacaense, commonly known as the Colombian star-labium, is a unique orchid species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped floral structure, which is both visually appealing and structurally specialized for pollination. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist climate. Its flowers exhibit a complex arrangement of sepals and petals, with a distinctive labellum that plays a key role in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellilabium boyacaense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
