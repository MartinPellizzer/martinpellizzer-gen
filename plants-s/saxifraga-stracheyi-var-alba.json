    "intro": "Saxifraga stracheyi var. alba, commonly known as the white sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-white, woolly leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Saxifraga stracheyi var. alba plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments."
