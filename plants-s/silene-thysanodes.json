    "intro": "Silene thysanodes, commonly known as the silky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has hairy, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. Silene thysanodes thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and moths due to its nectar-rich flowers."
