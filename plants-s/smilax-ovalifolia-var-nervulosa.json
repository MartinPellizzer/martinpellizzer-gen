    "intro": "Smilax ovalifolia var. nervulosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined arrowhead vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
