    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos hoalensis, commonly known as the Hoal's globular star, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually dense and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
