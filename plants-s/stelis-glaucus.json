    "intro": "Stelis glaucus, commonly known as the blue-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features wiry, often blue-green stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a pale yellow or greenish hue, and are often fragrant. Stelis glaucus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
