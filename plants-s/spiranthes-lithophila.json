It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in dry, open habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient uptake. Spiranthes lithophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
