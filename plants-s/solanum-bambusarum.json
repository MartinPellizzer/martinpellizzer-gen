    "intro": "Solanum bambusarum, commonly known as bamboo nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems that resemble bamboo. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
