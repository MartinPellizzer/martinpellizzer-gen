    "intro": "Stellaria circinata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It has small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are opposite, rounded, and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along paths. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
