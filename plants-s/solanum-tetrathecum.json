    "intro": "Solanum tetrathecum, commonly known as the four-ovary nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its distinctive four-chambered ovary, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, with simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or purple in color. Its fruits are berries that contain several seeds, and the plant is known for its potential medicinal properties in traditional medicine. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it may contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
