It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that mature in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. The berries are toxic when raw but can be used in cooking after proper preparation."
