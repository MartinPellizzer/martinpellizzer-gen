It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense stands, and its leaves are narrow and blade-like. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers during the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Schoenoplectus scirpoides is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams."
