    "intro": "Salix amplexicaulis, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky white hair, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Salix amplexicaulis is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in cold, rocky or sandy soils where few other plants can survive."
