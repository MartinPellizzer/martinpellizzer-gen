    "intro": "Selaginella venulosa, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense, mat-like clusters on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. Selaginella venulosa is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to survive in dry, shaded environments. Its ability to retain moisture and its unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
