    "intro": "Solanum laciniatum var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant nightshade, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely lobed, dark green leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces berries that mature to a vivid red, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
