    "intro": "Sempervivum iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rosette-forming leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves to survive in harsh conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Sempervivum iranicum is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
