    "intro": "Serjania crassifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests. Due to its valuable wood, it is also a species of concern for conservation efforts."
