    "intro": "Salix lucida var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian habitats."
