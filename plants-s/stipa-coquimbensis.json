    "intro": "Stipa coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Chile. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale to golden bracts, which are adapted to thrive in dry, windy environments. It is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert areas. Stipa coquimbensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
