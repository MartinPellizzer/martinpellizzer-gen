    "intro": "Silene cretica subsp. annulata, commonly known as the ringed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are alternate and usually have a distinctive reddish or purplish coloration. The subspecies is distinguished by its annular (ring-like) markings on the calyx, which give it its common name."
