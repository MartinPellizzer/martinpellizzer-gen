    "intro": "Seriphium plumosum var. canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a fine, grayish-white layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, attracting various pollinators."
