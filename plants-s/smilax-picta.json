    "intro": "Smilax picta, commonly known as the painted smilax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, spiny stems that often root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are inconspicuous and are followed by bright red berries. Smilax picta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
