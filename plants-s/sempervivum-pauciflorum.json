    "intro": "Sempervivum pauciflorum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a hardy succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions has earned it the common name \"everlasting,\" reflecting its resilience and long lifespan."
