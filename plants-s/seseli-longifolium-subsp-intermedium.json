    "intro": "Seseli longifolium subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate longleaf seseli, is a flowering plant native to parts of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
