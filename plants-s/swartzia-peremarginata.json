    "intro": "Swartzia peremarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several elliptical seeds. Due to its high-quality wood, it has been heavily harvested, leading to its classification as an endangered species."
