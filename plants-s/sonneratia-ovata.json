    "intro": "Sonneratia ovata, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its smooth, often white-woody bark and its ability to tolerate saline conditions. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a waxy surface. Its flowers are pale yellow and clustered in spikes, while the fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Sonneratia ovata plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
