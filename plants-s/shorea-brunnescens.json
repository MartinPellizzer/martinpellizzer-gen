    "intro": "Shorea brunnescens, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark bark and ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and often covered in a waxy layer. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing yellowish or greenish blooms. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation in coastal environments."
