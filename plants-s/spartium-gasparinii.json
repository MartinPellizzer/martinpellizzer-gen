    "intro": "Spartium gasparinii, commonly known as California gorse, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves and produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Spartium gasparinii is adapted to mild, Mediterranean climates and is somewhat drought-tolerant once established."
