    "intro": "Scabrethia scabra subsp. cinerea, commonly known as the grey scabrethia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that often appear greyish due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or arctic regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
