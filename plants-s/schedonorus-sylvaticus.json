    "intro": "Schedonorus sylvaticus, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Schedonorus sylvaticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in natural and landscaped environments."
