It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its unique and often toxic sap. The plant features small, green, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its milky latex and spiny stems, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
