    "intro": "Saxifraga ligularis, commonly known as the spoon-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered in a single umbel. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Saxifraga ligularis is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to avoid damage from strong winds and freezing temperatures."
