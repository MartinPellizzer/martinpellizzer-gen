    "intro": "Sanicula orthacantha var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sanicula, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Its roots are fibrous and have a distinctive aromatic scent. This variety is smaller than the typical Sanicula orthacantha, with a more compact growth habit."
