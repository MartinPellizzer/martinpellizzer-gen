    "intro": "Sinarundinaria anceps, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across rocky or shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive bipinnate structure that gives it a feathery appearance. Sinarundinaria anceps thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found growing on cliffs or in forest understories."
