    "intro": "Stenandrium rupestre, commonly known as the rock heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, dense clusters of needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
