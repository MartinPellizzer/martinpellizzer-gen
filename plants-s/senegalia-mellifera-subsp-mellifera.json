    "intro": "Senegalia mellifera subsp. mellifera, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow, fluffy inflorescences that produce small, edible pods. The plant is adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and livestock, as well as stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas. Its nectar is a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees."
