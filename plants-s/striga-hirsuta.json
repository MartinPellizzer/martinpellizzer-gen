    "intro": "Striga hirsuta, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects crops such as maize and sorghum. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and seeds that are dispersed by wind, animals, or water. Its rapid growth and ability to cause significant yield losses make it a major agricultural pest in sub-Saharan Africa. Botanically, it belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its weak, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow leaves."
