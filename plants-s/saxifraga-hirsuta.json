    "intro": "Saxifraga hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in crevices and on slopes. Saxifraga hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
