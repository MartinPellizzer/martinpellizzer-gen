    "intro": "Sorghum durra var. eois, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikes of small, hard grains that mature in dry conditions. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important crop in many developing countries. Its grains are rich in carbohydrates and are used for food, animal feed, and even brewing. The plant's fibrous stalks are also used for thatching and construction in traditional practices."
