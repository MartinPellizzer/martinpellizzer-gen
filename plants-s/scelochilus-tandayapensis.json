    "intro": "Scelochilus tandayapensis, commonly known as the Tandayap\u00e9 orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss, while its roots form extensive networks to anchor it in rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
