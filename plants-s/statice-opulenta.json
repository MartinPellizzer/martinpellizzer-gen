    "intro": "Statice opulenta, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Statice opulenta is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ability to add color to seaside landscapes."
