    "intro": "Stuhlmannia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, succulent stems adapted to store water. Their flowers are often showy, with tubular corollas that range in color from white to pink or red. Stuhlmannia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
