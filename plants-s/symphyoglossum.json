    "intro": "Symphyoglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its elongated, leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems, known as pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in a spike. Symphyoglossum is typically found growing on trees or in shaded, moist environments. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
