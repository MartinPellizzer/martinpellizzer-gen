    "intro": "Sagina procumbens var. littoralis, commonly known as beach sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its tiny, rounded leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit helps it stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
