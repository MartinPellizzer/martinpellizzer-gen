    "intro": "Salix altaica, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of central and eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and produces catkin-like flowers in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and turn yellow in the fall. Salix altaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
