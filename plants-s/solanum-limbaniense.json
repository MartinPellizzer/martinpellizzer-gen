    "intro": "Solanum limbaniense, commonly known as the Limban nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries contain alkaloids and are typically toxic to humans and animals, making the plant a subject of both botanical interest and caution."
