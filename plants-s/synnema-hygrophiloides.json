    "intro": "Synnema hygrophiloides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in still or slow-moving water. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Synnema hygrophiloides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
