It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Stipa lingua is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its adaptability and resilience make it a common component of many ecological communities."
