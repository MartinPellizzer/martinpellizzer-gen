    "intro": "Stachys speluncarum, commonly known as the cave betony, is a rare and elusive plant species native to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves and is adapted to low-light conditions through specialized leaf structures. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which are pollinated by specific insect species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground substrates. Due to its restricted habitat, Stachys speluncarum is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
