It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming a rosette of leaves with a dense cluster of flowers at the center. Steenisia species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and compact growth habit. They thrive in moist, well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
