It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from summer to fall. Sida dilleniana is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
