    "intro": "Stemmadenia leeuwenbergiana, commonly known as the Natal star vine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supporting structures as it grows. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds."
