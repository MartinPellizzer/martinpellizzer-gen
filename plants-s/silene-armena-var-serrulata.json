    "intro": "Silene armena var. serrulata, commonly known as Armenian catchfly, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features hairy, slender stems and lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
