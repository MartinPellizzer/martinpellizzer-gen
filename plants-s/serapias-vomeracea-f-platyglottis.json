    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea f. platyglottis, commonly known as the flat-tongued orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, flattened labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected plant in many regions."
