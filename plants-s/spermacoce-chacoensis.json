It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide range of flowering plants, many of which are known for their ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure, which is a key feature of the genus Spermacoce. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal in natural habitats."
