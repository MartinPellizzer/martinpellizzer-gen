    "intro": "Stellaria scaturiginella, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds. Stellaria scaturiginella is often found in temperate regions and is considered a common weed in cultivated areas."
