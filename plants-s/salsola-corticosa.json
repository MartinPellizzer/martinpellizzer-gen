    "intro": "Salsola corticosa, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and coastal areas. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that develop into spherical, dry fruits. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep roots and a high tolerance for salt and drought. Salsola corticosa is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
