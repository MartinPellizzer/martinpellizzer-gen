    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor subsp. dictyocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, woodland environments and features lance-shaped leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of S. minor."
