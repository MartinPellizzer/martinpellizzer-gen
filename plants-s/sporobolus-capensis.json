It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant and suitable for erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
