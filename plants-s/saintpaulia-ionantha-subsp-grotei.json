    "intro": "Saintpaulia ionantha subsp. grotei, commonly known as the African violet, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect light to prevent leaf scorching. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The subspecies grotei is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves and slightly different flower structure compared to other Saintpaulia varieties."
