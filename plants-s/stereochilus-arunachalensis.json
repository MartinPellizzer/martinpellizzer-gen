    "intro": "Stereochilus arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal Himalayan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in moist, shaded forest areas. Its unique morphology includes a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
