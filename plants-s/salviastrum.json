    "intro": "Salviastrum, commonly known as the desert sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have gray-green, hairy leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. They are adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Salviastrum species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
