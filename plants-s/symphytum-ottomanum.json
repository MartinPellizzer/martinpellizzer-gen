    "intro": "Symphytum ottomanum, commonly known as Turkish comfrey, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and tall spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains allantoin, a compound known for its soothing properties, and is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. However, due to its potential to be invasive, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
