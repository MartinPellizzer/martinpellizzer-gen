    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur reed, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
