    "intro": "Sebastiania pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces woody capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
