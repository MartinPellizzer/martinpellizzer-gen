    "intro": "Sinocarum vaginatum, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers are typically tubular at the base and open into a funnel shape, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sinocarum vaginatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
