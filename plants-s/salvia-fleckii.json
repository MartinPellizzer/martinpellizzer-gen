    "intro": "Salvia fleckii, commonly known as the Fleck's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-gray hue and its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. Salvia fleckii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardiness."
