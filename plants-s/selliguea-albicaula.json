    "intro": "Selliguea albicaula, commonly known as the white-veined liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are usually closely arranged, with a distinctive white or pale green coloration on the underside. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are simple and lack the complex organs found in vascular plants. Selliguea albicaula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
