    "intro": "Sorbus isenacensis, commonly known as the Isenac's rowan, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus isenacensis is considered a vulnerable species."
