    "intro": "Septilia repens, commonly known as the creeping septilia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in clusters during the late summer and autumn months. Septilia repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
