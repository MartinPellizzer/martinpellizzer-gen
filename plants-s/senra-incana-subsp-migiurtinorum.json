    "intro": "Senra incana subsp. migiurtinorum, commonly known as the Ethiopian ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically from July to September. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
