    "intro": "Streptopus roseus var. curvipes, commonly known as the curled-leaf streptopus, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
