    "intro": "Saxifraga capitata, commonly known as the rockfoil or clustered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs to protect against frost. Saxifraga capitata is often found in mountainous areas, where it contributes to the alpine flora and serves as a food source for various pollinators."
