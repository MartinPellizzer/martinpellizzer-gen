    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. violascens, commonly known as the violet-leaved houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a bluish or violet tint. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and protects against intense sunlight. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. This hardy plant is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, or as a ground cover in well-drained soil."
