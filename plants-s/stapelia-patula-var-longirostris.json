It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive scent resembling decaying flesh. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The varietal name 'longirostris' refers to its elongated, narrow flower shape."
