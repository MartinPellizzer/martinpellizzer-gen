    "intro": "Selaginella plumosa f. tetragonostachya, commonly known as the four-stamen spikemoss, is a fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
