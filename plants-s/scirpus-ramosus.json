    "intro": "Scirpus ramosus, commonly known as the tufted bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, branching clusters of flowering stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. Scirpus ramosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
