    "intro": "Selaginella sheldonii, commonly known as Sheldon's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, carpet-like appearance with slender, needle-like leaves. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are positioned at the tips of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
