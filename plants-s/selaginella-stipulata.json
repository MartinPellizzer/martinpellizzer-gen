    "intro": "Selaginella stipulata, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around its stems. Selaginella stipulata produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located on the upper surfaces of its leaves. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its unique adaptations to arid conditions."
