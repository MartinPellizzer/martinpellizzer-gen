    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum calycinum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum calycinum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
