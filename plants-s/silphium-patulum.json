    "intro": "Silphium patulum, commonly known as the eastern prairie fringed orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the wetlands of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system that helps it thrive in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Silphium patulum is also notable for its fragrant, nectar-rich flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
