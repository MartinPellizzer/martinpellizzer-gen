    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. terretris, commonly known as the salt marsh bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush native to coastal and wetland areas. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in brackish environments. The plant thrives in saline or brackish water, often found in marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikes of small, three-lobed flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
