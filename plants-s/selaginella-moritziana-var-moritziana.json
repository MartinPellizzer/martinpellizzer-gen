    "intro": "Selaginella moritziana var. moritziana, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of clubmoss native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce spore-bearing structures called sporophytes. Its leaves are linear and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
