    "intro": "Senegalia reniformis, commonly known as the huisache tree, is a drought-deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in limestone areas. Senegalia reniformis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
