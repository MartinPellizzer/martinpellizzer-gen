    "intro": "Selaginella arroyoana, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit with spirally arranged leaves. The plant has a unique ability to survive in dry conditions due to its thick, waxy cuticle and ability to enter a state of dormancy. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of the leaves. Selaginella arroyoana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
