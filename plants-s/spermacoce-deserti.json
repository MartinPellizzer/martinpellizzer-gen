    "intro": "Spermacoce deserti, commonly known as the desert sida, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed capsules, and the plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. Spermacoce deserti is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems."
