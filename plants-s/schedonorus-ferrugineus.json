It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades with a reddish tinge, especially under stress. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass and forage production. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is relatively drought-tolerant. Schedonorus ferrugineus is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its low maintenance requirements."
