It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender stems and small, oval leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
