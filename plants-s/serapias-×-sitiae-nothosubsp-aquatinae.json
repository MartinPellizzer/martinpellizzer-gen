It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and orange flowers with a prominent central column. The plant typically grows in wet or semi-aquatic habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to retain moisture. This nothosubspecies exhibits interesting morphological traits that reflect its hybrid origin."
