    "intro": "Sclerochloa maritima var. deflexa, commonly known as the bentleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled or folded, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. This species is adapted to withstand high salinity and wind exposure, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
