    "intro": "Sibbaldia procumbens var. valdehirta, commonly known as the creeping sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variant is closely related to other members of the Papaveraceae family and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
