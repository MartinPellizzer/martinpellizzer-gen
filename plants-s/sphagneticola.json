These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Sphagneticola species are typically annual or perennial herbs that can grow up to several meters in height. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color."
