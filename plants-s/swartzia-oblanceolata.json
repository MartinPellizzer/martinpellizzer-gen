    "intro": "Swartzia oblanceolata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Swartzia oblanceolata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas."
