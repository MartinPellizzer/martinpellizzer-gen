    "intro": "Saccolabium guttatum var. holfordii, commonly known as the Holford's stinkbush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that exude a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed, a feature that likely serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a subtle floral display to its harsh environment. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Saccolabium, which are known for their aromatic and sometimes toxic properties."
