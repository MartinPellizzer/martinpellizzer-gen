    "intro": "Scaevola taccada var. tuamotuensis, commonly known as the Tahitian ice plant, is a flowering plant native to the French Polynesian islands. It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, sky-blue or white flowers. The plant has fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
