    "intro": "Sempervivum obovatum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, obovate leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces basal flower stems that bear clusters of pink or red flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ability to propagate through offsets makes it easy to cultivate and maintain."
