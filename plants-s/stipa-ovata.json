    "intro": "Stipa ovata, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Stipa ovata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
