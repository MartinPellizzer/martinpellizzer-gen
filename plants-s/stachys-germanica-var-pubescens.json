    "intro": "Stachys germanica var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows. Its hairy foliage and striking inflorescences make it a notable species in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
