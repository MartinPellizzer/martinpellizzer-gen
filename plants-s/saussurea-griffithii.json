    "intro": "Saussurea griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan flame flower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. Saussurea griffithii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
