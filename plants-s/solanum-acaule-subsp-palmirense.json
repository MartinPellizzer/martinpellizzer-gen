    "intro": "Solanum acaule subsp. palmirense, commonly known as the palmira nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It is a shrub-like species with small, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to grow in sandy or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
