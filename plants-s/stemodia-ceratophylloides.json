    "intro": "Stemodia ceratophylloides, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its sap is milky and contains latex, which can be toxic to some animals. Stemodia ceratophylloides plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
