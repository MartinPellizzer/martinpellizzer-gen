    "intro": "Sesleria tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers in early summer. Sesleria tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
