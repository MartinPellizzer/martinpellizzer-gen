    "intro": "Spermacoce heteromorpha, commonly known as the variable bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, three-lobed berries. Spermacoce heteromorpha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
