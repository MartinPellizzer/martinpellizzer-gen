    "intro": "Soaresia, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod fern,\" is a genus of ferns native to South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Soaresia species often have a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and colonize new areas. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a specific pattern on the underside of the fronds."
