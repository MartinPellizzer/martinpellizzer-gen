    "intro": "Sorbus umbellata var. baldaccii, commonly known as the Baldaccii whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for various bird species. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
