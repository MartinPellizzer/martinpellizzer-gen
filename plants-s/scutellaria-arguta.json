It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces delicate, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Scutellaria arguta is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
