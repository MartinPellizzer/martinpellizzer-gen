    "intro": "Scirpus triqueter, commonly known as the three-angled bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale brown flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Scirpus triqueter plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
