    "intro": "Sinomalus daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng mountain fern, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that exhibit a unique, intricate morphology. The plant thrives in cool, moist microhabitats, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sinomalus daochengensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
