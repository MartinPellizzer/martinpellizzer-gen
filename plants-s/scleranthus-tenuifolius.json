    "intro": "Scleranthus tenuifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that typically grow close to the ground. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing tiny white or pale pink blooms. Scleranthus tenuifolius is adapted to sandy or dry soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats."
