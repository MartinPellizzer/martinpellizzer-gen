    "intro": "Sisymbrium alpinum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the Alpine mustard, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 60 cm tall, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust fruits compared to other varieties of Sisymbrium alpinum."
