    "intro": "Stelleropsis tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Tianshan mountain range in Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Stelleropsis tianschanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
