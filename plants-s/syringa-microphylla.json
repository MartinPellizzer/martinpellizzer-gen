    "intro": "Syringa microphylla, commonly known as the weeping cherry or Japanese weeping cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a fine texture, turning yellow in autumn. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental in gardens. Its ornamental value is largely due to its beautiful flowering display and graceful, drooping branches."
