    "intro": "Sitobolium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive sticky surface, which aids in seed dispersal. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and seed production."
