It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
