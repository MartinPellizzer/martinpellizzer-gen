    "intro": "Salsola lancifolia, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has spiny, lobed leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spherical, dry fruits. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep roots and the ability to store water. Salsola lancifolia is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded areas."
