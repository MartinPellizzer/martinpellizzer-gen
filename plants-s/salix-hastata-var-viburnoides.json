    "intro": "Salix hastata var. viburnoides, commonly known as the dwarf willow or creeping willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It produces catkins, which are the male flowers, and is typically found in moist, acidic soils near streams or wetlands. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
