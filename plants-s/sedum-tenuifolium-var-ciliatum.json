    "intro": "Sedum tenuifolium var. ciliatum, commonly known as the ciliated stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, covered with fine, hair-like structures called cilia, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, low-maintenance plants."
