    "intro": "Sauvagesia aliciae subsp. aliciae, commonly known as the Alice's sauvagesia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its distinctive blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
