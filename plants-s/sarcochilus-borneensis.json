    "intro": "Sarcochilus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces fleshy, leathery pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically fragrant and bloom during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Sarcochilus borneensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
