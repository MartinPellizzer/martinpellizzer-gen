    "intro": "Saxifraga hypericoides var. aurantiascens, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cymes and attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize rocky soils effectively. The species is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
