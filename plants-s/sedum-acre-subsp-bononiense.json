    "intro": "Sedum acre subsp. bononiense, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
