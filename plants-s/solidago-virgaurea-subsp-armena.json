It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, branching clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and vibrant blooms."
