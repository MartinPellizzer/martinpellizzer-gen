    "intro": "Saxifraga valentina, commonly known as the Valentine's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
