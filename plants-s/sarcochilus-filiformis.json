    "intro": "Sarcochilus filiformis, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often twisted leaves that resemble the shape of a sword. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.
