    "intro": "Salix caprea var. lanatifolia, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescent leaves that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodlands. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
