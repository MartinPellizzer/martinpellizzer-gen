It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are often covered in a dense mat of foliage, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Saurauia pseudoveraguensis is typically found in humid, tropical regions with rich, acidic soils."
