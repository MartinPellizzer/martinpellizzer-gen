    "intro": "Scleria adamantina, commonly known as the hard-stemmed umbrella sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scleria adamantina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
