    "intro": "Sapria poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small, intricate orchids. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in dense forests where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, elongated shape that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sapria poilanei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
