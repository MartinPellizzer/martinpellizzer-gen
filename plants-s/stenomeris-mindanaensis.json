    "intro": "Stenomeris mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao stenomeris, is a flowering plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Stemonaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including elongated leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as montane forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
