    "intro": "Salix laeta, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-gray bark that exudes a fragrant resin. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-white underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in alpine meadows. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
