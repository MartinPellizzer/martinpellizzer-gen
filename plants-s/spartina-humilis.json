    "intro": "Spartina humilis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. Spartina humilis plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an essential component of coastal ecosystems."
