    "intro": "Sesleria varia var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to rocky and calcareous soils in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky outcrops and woodland edges. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a hardy and resilient species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local insect populations."
