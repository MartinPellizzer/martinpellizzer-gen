    "intro": "Sapium hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in some regions. The tree has a shallow root system and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
