It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and ornate appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Sulettaria surculosa has a simple thalloid structure with a central axis and leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
