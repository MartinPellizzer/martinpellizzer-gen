    "intro": "Solanum semievectum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows in low, dense mats, with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, toxic berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and natural habitats."
