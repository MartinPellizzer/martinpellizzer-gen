    "intro": "Sampera pastoensis, commonly known as the Pasto orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, Sampera pastoensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
