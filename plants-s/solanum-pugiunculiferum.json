It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America, particularly the Andean regions. The plant produces small, yellow, egg-shaped fruits that turn orange-red when ripe. These fruits are covered in a fine, powdery coating called a bloom, which gives them a unique appearance. The plant is valued for its edible fruits, which are used in various culinary applications and traditional medicine."
