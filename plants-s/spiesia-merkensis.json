It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. Native to specific regions in Africa, this plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil. The plant is also noted for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it well adapted to dry conditions."
