    "intro": "Sphaeralcea orbiculata, commonly known as the globe mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with upright stems and small, orbicular leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Sphaeralcea orbiculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
