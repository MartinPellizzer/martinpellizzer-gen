    "intro": "Salix versifolia, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape across the species. The leaves are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale green underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollen dispersal. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks."
