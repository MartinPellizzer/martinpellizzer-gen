    "intro": "Strophanthus dichotomus, commonly known as the African milkvine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Its roots and leaves contain cardiac glycosides, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
