    "intro": "Salix dacica, commonly known as the Danubian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in moist, often swampy environments. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pale green underside, while the catkins are a distinctive feature of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. Salix dacica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing wetland soils."
