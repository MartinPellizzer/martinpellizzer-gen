It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
