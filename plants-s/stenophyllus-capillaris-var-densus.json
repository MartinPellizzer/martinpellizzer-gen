    "intro": "Stenophyllus capillaris var. densus, commonly known as the dense-stemmed feather grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and slender, wiry stems. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is native to regions of North America. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed, giving it a feathery appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland landscapes. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth compared to other varieties of Stenophyllus capillaris."
