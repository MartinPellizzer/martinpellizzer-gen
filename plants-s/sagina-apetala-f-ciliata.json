    "intro": "[WRONG START] Sagina apetila f. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, closely packed, succulent leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its compact form and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
