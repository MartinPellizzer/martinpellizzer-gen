    "intro": "Sagittaria platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a distinctive broad, flat structure. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the water surface, typically in late summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize wetland areas effectively. Sagittaria platyphylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
