    "intro": "Santalum insulare var. deckeri, commonly known as the Christmas Island sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. It is a hemiparasitic tree that relies on other plants for part of its nutrient intake, while still performing photosynthesis. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, aromatic bark and dark green, glossy leaves. Its small, white flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
