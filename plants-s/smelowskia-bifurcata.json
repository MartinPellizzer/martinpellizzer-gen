    "intro": "Smelowskia bifurcata, commonly known as the twin-branch smelowskia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bifurcated stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. It is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is considered an important component of its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered."
