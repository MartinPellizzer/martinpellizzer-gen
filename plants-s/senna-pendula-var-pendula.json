    "intro": "Senna pendula var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its drooping, feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, thread-like leaflets, and the plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often used in ornamental landscaping for its unique appearance. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
