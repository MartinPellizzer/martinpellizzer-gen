    "intro": "Selaginella integerrima, commonly known as the basket fern or clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique life cycle involving both spore-producing and gametophyte stages. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around a central stem, giving it a fern-like appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Selaginella integerrima is also notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, including periods of drought."
