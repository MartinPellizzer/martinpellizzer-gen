    "intro": "Spiranthes chlorops, commonly known as the yellow spire orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces delicate, spiraling inflorescences of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system consists of a dense network of rhizomes and mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is characterized by its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific fungal partners in its ecosystem."
