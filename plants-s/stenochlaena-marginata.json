    "intro": "Stenochlaena marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern or the marginate fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive margin that is often frayed or toothed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in its native habitat. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of the forest flora."
