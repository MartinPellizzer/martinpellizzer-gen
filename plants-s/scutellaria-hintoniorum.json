It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
