    "intro": "Stellaria monantha, commonly known as white-stemmed starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Stellaria monantha is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
