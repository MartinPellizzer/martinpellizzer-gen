    "intro": "Scoparia annua var. glandulifera, commonly known as glandular scroparia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features slender, branched stems covered with glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and also bear glandular structures, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adaptable to a range of environmental conditions."
