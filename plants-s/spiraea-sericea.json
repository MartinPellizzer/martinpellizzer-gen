    "intro": "Spiraea sericea, commonly known as silverleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-white foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Spiraea sericea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
