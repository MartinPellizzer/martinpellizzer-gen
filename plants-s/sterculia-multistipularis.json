    "intro": "Sterculia multistipularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sterculia, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
