    "intro": "Stapelia variegata var. laeta, commonly known as the variegated star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, a feature common in many succulents to reduce water evaporation. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal care."
