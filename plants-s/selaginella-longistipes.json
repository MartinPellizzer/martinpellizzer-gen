    "intro": "Selaginella longistipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique form of resurrection plant behavior, capable of surviving extreme desiccation and reviving upon rehydration. The plant has a creeping, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are borne on specialized stalks, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling."
