    "intro": "Schismatoglottis pseudocalyptrata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped spathes that enclose the inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, with slender, often hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or white, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Schismatoglottis pseudocalyptrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
