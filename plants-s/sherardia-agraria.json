    "intro": "Sherardia agraria, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, green berries that turn orange-red when mature. The fruit is rich in vitamin C and has been used in traditional medicine for its antioxidant properties. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
