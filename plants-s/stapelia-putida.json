    "intro": "Stapelia putida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and lack of traditional leaves, which are instead replaced by specialized structures called phylloclades. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Stapelia putida is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. Its rarity and distinctive appearance make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
