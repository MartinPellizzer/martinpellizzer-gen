    "intro": "Synotis kunthiana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss. Synotis kunthiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
