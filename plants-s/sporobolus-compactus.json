    "intro": "Sporobolus compactus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to form dense mats, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed soils. Sporobolus compactus is well adapted to grazing and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
