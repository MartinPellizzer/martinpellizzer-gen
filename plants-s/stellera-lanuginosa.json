    "intro": "Stellera lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northwestern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks, often in areas with partial shade. Its flowers are small, white, and star-shaped, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, giving it its common name. Stellera lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
