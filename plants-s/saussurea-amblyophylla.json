    "intro": "Saussurea amblyophylla, commonly known as the Tibetan cloud flower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It features a short, fibrous root system and a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower with violet markings, which blooms in late summer. It is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
