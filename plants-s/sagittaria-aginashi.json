    "intro": "Sagittaria aginashi, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that often extend into the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's edge. Its roots help stabilize sediment and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems. Sagittaria aginashi is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
