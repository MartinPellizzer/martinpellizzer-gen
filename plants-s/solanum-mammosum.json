    "intro": "Solanum mammosum, commonly known as the \"mammoth tomato\" or \"devil's apple,\" is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into distinctive, swollen, tomato-like fruits. These fruits are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, containing numerous small seeds. Solanum mammosum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and is also used in traditional medicine."
