    "intro": "Stapelia albipilosa, commonly known as the white-haired stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, often unpleasant odor. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Stapelia albipilosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
