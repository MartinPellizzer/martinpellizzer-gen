    "intro": "Salix longipes var. wardii, commonly known as the Ward's willow, is a rare and specialized shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its harsh environment, with a deep root system that helps it survive in cold and arid conditions. It produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically pollinated by wind, a common reproductive strategy in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
