It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Seriphium phylicoides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
