    "intro": "Selinum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf garlic or flatleaf garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its flat, garlic-scented leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its rhizomes and roots are the primary parts used, containing compounds with potential medicinal properties. Selinum latifolium thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
