The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and the stems are rigid and covered in fine, waxy hairs. This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
