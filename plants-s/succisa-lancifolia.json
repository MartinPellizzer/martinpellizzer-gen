    "intro": "Succisa lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
