    "intro": "Statice cosyrensis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Statice cosyrensis is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
