    "intro": "Selaginella barklyi, commonly known as the Cape Verde spikemoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant native to the island of Santiago in the Cape Verde archipelago. It is a member of the spikemoss family, Lepidophyta, and is characterized by its creeping, stem-like structures that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a specialized adaptation to its arid environment, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Selaginella barklyi is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
