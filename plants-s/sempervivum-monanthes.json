    "intro": "Sempervivum monanthes, commonly known as the common houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Sempervivum monanthes is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
