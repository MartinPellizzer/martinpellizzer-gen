    "intro": "Schefflera chococola, commonly known as the Chocolate Schefflera, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical regions. It features glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like shape at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
