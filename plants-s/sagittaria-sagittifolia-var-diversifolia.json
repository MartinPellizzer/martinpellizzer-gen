    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically broad and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark blue berries that are dispersed by water. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moist to submerged soil conditions. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
