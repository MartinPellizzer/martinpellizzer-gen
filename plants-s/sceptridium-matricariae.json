    "intro": "Sceptridium matricariae, commonly known as the yellow starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a creeping habit with numerous slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in damp woodlands."
