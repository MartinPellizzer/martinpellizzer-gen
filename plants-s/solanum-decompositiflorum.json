    "intro": "Solanum decompositiflorum, commonly known as the decomposed flower nightshade, is a rare and enigmatic species belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble decaying foliage, a trait that may serve as a camouflage mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually ovate with a velvety texture, and the fruit is a small, globose berry that contains toxic alkaloids. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
