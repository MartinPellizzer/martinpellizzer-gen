It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically entire or slightly lobed. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which bloom in summer. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
