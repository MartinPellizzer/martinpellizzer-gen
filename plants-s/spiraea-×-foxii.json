It is characterized by its graceful, arching branches that cascade with clusters of small, fragrant flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features dark green, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers, which range from white to pink, bloom in dense panicles and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Spiraea \u00d7 foxii is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its ornate appearance."
