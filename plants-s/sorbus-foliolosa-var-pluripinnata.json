    "intro": "Sorbus foliolosa var. pluripinnata, commonly known as the many-feathered whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fruit is a small, aggregate berry that ripens in late summer, providing food for various wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
