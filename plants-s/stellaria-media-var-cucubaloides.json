    "intro": "Stellaria media var. cucubaloides, commonly known as the cushion starwort, is a variant of the common chickweed. It is a low-growing, mat-forming herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, star-shaped white flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are wiry and often branched. This variety is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in disturbed or open habitats. It is often found in alpine or arctic regions, where it contributes to the vegetation cover in harsh environments."
