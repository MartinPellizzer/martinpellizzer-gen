    "intro": "Saussurea coriacea, commonly known as the hard-stemmed safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and dense, hairy foliage that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its fibrous roots are adapted to poor soil conditions, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Saussurea coriacea is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
