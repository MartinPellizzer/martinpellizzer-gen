    "intro": "Salix planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are flat and smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. The bark of Salix planifolia is smooth and grayish-brown, and it may exude a milky sap when wounded."
