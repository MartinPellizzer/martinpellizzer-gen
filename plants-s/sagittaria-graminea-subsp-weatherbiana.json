    "intro": "Sagittaria graminea subsp. weatherbiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and has strap-like, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white, arrowhead-shaped flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize sediments. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams."
