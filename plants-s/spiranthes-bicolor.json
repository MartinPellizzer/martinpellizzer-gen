    "intro": "Spiranthes bicolor, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences with pink and white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, and the plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
