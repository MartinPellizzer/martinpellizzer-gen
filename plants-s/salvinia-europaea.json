    "intro": "Salvinia europaea, commonly known as European watermoss, is a small, floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with tiny roots hanging below. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Salvinia europaea reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its rapid growth and potential to form dense mats, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting aquatic ecosystems."
