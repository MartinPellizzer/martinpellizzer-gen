    "intro": "Sida rhombifolia f. corchorifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sida, is a variant of the sida plant characterized by its distinctive, narrow, rhombic leaves. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its flowers are small and clustered, with five petals, and it produces capsules as its fruit type. This form is notable for its morphological differences from the typical Sida rhombifolia, particularly in leaf shape and size."
