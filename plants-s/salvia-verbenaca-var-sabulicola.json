The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
