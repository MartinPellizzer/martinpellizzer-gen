    "intro": "Scrobicaria soatana, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically grows on rock surfaces in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. The thallus is lecanorine, with a dark, fissured surface that gives it a distinctive appearance. It lacks true leaves but has a complex arrangement of photobionts and fungal structures. This lichen is known for its chemical composition, including depsides and depsidones, which contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
