    "intro": "Selaginella springiana, commonly known as the spring star moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microstrobili and megastrobili, which are characteristic of its evolutionary lineage. Selaginella springiana is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often found in temperate regions."
