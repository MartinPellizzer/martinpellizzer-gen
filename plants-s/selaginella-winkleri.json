    "intro": "Selaginella winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically clustered around a central stem. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella winkleri exhibits a unique ability to survive in low-light conditions and can tolerate periods of drought due to its specialized root system. Its structure and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
