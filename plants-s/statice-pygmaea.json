    "intro": "Statice pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf glasswort, is a small, flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, spike-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. It has succulent leaves and stems that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Statice pygmaea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
