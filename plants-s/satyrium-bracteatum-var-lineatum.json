    "intro": "Satyrium bracteatum var. lineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is typically darker in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
