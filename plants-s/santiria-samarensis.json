    "intro": "Santiria samarensis, commonly known as Samarensis Santiria, is a flowering plant native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in Central Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Santiria samarensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
