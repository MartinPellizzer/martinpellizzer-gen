    "intro": "Stelis lacunata, commonly known as the hollow-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hollow stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Stelis lacunata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
