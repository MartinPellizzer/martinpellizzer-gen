It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal environments, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, adapted to the harsh coastal conditions.
