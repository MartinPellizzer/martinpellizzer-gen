    "intro": "Scleria asperrima, commonly known as the rough sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Scleria asperrima is often found in temperate regions of Africa and is adapted to tolerate varying water levels and soil conditions."
