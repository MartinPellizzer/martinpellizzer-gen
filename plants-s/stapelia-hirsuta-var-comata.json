    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta var. comata, commonly known as the woolly Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. This species is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
