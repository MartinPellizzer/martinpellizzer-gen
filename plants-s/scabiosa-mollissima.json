    "intro": "Scabiosa mollissima, commonly known as sweet scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scabiosa mollissima is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
