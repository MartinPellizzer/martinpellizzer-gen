    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum sandianum, commonly known as the Sandia tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the island of Guam in the Mariana Islands and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sciodaphyllum sandianum is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and other threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
