    "intro": "Salpianthus purpurascens, commonly known as the red-flowered milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of striking red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Salpianthus purpurascens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
