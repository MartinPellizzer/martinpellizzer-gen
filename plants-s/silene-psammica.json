    "intro": "Silene psammica, commonly known as the sand cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in the Mediterranean region. It produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. Silene psammica is often found in dunes and rocky habitats where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
