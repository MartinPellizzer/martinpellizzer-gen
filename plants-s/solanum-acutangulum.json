It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
