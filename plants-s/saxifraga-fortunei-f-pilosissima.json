    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei f. pilosissima, commonly known as the silvery saxifrage, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
