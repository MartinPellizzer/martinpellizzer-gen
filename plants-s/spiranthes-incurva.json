    "intro": "Spiranthes incurva, commonly known as the nodding spirea, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds with fine hairs for wind dispersal. Spiranthes incurva is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
