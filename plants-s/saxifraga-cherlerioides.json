    "intro": "Saxifraga cherlerioides, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Saxifraga cherlerioides is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic species of alpine meadows."
