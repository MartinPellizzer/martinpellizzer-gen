It features broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum ivanportillae is prized for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors with minimal care."
