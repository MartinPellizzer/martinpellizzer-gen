    "intro": "Salvia vitifolia, commonly known as grape-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant addition to xeriscapes. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for native gardens."
