    "intro": "Senecio ricardii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Senecio ricardii plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert environments and provides nectar for pollinators."
