    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a combination of white, yellow, and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity and potential toxicity if underripe. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
