    "intro": "Saccharum reptans, commonly known as the wandering grass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces tall, slender stalks with narrow, blade-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in the summer months. Saccharum reptans is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
