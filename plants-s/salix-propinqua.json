    "intro": "Salix propinqua, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silver-green underside that reflects the harsh light of its environment. Salix propinqua thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
