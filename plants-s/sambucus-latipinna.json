    "intro": "Sambucus latipinna, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by red or black berries in the fall. Its berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation, as they can be toxic in large quantities. Sambucus latipinna is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to wildlife."
