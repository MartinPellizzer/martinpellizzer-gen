    "intro": "Sphaerothalamus, commonly known as the globe-thrum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with flowers that are typically clustered in umbels and often have a distinctive, globular appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
