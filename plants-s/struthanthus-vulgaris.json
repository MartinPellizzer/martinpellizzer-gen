    "intro": "Struthanthus vulgaris, commonly known as the common struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Struthanthus vulgaris is an important species for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
