It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
