    "intro": "Sophora violacea, commonly known as the purple sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. Sophora violacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
