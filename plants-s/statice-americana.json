    "intro": "Statice americana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, aiding in its adaptation to saline environments. Statice americana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats."
