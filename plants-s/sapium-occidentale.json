    "intro": "Sapium occidentale, commonly known as the western persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and latex-producing properties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its fruits are fleshy, orange-red berries that contain a single seed, and they mature in the fall. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
