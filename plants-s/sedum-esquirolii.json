    "intro": "Sedum esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
