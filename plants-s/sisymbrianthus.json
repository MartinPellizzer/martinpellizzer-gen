    "intro": "Sisymbrianthus, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs with small, four-petaled flowers that range in color from white to purple. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that splits open to release the seeds. Sisymbrianthus species are often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
