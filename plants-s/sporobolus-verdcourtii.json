    "intro": "Sporobolus verdcourtii, commonly known as the Verdcourt's sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in degraded landscapes. Sporobolus verdcourtii is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall."
