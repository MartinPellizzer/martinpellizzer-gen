    "intro": "Senecio carpetanus, commonly known as the carpet cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to arid conditions. Senecio carpetanus is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
