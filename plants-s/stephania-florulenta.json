    "intro": "Stephania florulenta, commonly known as the pink-flowered stephania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a glossy surface, while its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Stephania florulenta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
