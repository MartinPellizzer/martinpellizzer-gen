    "intro": "Scirpus microcarpus var. rubrotinctus, commonly known as the red-stem bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its reddish-brown stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The reddish coloration of its stems is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other bulrush species."
