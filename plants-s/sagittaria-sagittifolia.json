    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
