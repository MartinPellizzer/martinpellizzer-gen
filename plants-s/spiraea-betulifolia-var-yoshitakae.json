It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are typically elongated and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscape design for its graceful appearance."
