    "intro": "Sansevieria aubrytiana, commonly known as the African spear or the snake plant, is a succulent plant native to tropical Africa. It features upright, sword-like leaves that are typically green with prominent white or yellow variegation. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, though flowering is rare in cultivation. Sansevieria aubrytiana is highly tolerant of low light and infrequent watering, making it an ideal indoor plant."
