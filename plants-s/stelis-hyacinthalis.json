    "intro": "Stelis hyacinthalis, commonly known as the hyacinth orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a sought-after species in horticulture."
