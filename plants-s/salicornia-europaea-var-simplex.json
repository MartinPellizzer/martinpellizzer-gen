    "intro": "Salicornia europaea var. simplex, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other moist, saline habitats. Its ability to store water in its tissues makes it well-suited for harsh, arid conditions."
