    "intro": "Schefflera crassibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Its foliage is thick and leathery, providing excellent shade and making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening. Schefflera crassibracteata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
