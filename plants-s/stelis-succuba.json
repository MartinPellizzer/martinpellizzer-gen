    "intro": "Stelis succuba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy of rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
