    "intro": "Salix wolfii subsp. idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho sand willow, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in sandy and gravelly soils along riverbanks and stream sides. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, elongated leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
