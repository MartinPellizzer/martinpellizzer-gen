    "intro": "Schizoglossum garuanum, commonly known as the Mexican stonecress, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Schizoglossum garuanum typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Its botanical features make it a resilient species in harsh, semi-desert climates."
