    "intro": "Sempervivum ciliosum var. galicicum, commonly known as the Galician houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees and parts of southern France. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with wavy margins and a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a range of climates, though it prefers cooler, temperate conditions."
