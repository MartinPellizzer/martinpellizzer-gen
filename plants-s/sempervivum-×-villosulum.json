    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 villosulum, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, woolly coating. The leaves are typically green or bluish-green, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. This hardy plant is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative indoor plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
