    "intro": "Salvadora persica var. pubescens, commonly known as the African toothbrush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, pubescent leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, woody fruits containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, saline soils. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties and traditional uses in oral care."
