    "intro": "Salvia oblongata, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems covered in dense, gray-green foliage with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia oblongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
