    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia subsp. leucopetala, commonly known as the white arrowhead, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
