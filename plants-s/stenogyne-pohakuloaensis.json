    "intro": "Stenogyne pohakuloaensis, commonly known as the Pohakuloa false hibiscus, is a rare shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is found in coastal areas with high sunlight exposure. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
