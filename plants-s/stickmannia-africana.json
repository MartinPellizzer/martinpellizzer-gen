    "intro": "Stickmannia africana, commonly known as the African stickman plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems that resemble the limbs of a stick figure, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Stickmannia africana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
