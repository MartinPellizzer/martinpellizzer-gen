    "intro": "Salix serpyllum, commonly known as the slender willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as stream banks and marshes. Salix serpyllum is also notable for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
