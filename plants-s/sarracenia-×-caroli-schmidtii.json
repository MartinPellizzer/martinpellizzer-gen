    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 caroli-schmidtii, commonly known as the Caroli-Schmidt sarracenia, is a hybrid pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, narrow pitchers. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with a distinctive green or yellow midrib, and they secrete a viscous liquid to trap insects. Sarracenia \u00d7 caroli-schmidtii thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, often found in bogs and marshes. Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it a popular specimen among plant enthusiasts and botanists."
