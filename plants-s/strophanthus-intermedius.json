    "intro": "Strophanthus intermedius, commonly known as the African Crown Bead, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bead-like orange to red berries that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy texture. Strophanthus intermedius is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes."
