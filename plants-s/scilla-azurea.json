    "intro": "Scilla azurea, commonly known as blue scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of striking blue or violet flowers in early spring. The flowers are typically bell-shaped and arranged in umbels, adding a delicate yet vibrant touch to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Scilla azurea is also valued for its early blooming habit, which provides color before many other spring flowers emerge."
