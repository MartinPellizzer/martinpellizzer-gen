    "intro": "Sarracenia venosa, commonly known as the pink-tongued sarracenia, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular leaves that form pitcher-like structures to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically red or orange with a pink or purple inner surface, creating a striking visual contrast. Sarracenia venosa thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure to maintain its vibrant colors. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
