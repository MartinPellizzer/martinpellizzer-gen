    "intro": "Schoenus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty sedgeland, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or rusty color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense mats on the ground. Schoenus ferrugineus is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
