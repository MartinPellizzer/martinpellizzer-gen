    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a compact, slow-growing plant with small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which give way to red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. The foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
