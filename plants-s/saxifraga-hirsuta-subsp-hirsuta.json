    "intro": "Saxifraga hirsuta subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, wiry stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptic, with a hairy texture that provides additional protection against cold and wind. Saxifraga hirsuta subsp. hirsuta is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
