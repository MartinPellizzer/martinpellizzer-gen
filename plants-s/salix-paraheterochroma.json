    "intro": "Salix paraheterochroma, commonly known as the variable willow, is a rare and unique species of willow native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly variable leaf coloration, which can range from green to yellow or even reddish hues. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its bark is thin and often peels in strips, and it produces catkins that are essential for its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
