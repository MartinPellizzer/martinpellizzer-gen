    "intro": "Scabiosa patens, commonly known as the fairy ring or pink scabious, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa patens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
