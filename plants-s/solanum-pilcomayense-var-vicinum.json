    "intro": "Solanum pilcomayense var. vicinum, commonly known as the Peruvian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic that aids in its pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are typically ovate and hairy, while the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range."
