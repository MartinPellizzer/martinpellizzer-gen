    "intro": "Stevia pearcei, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are often used as a natural sweetener in food and beverages, offering a zero-calorie alternative to sugar. Stevia pearcei is also valued for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
