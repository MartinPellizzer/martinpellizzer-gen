    "intro": "Sphedamnocarpus ambovombensis, commonly known as the Madagascar starfruit, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other well-known plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphedamnocarpus ambovombensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
