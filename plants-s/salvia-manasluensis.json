    "intro": "Salvia manasluensis, commonly known as the Manaslu sage, is a rare and endemic species native to the high altitudes of Nepal. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its flowers are usually violet or blue, with two-lipped petals typical of the sage genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
