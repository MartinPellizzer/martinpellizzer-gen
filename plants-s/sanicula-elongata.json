    "intro": "Sanicula elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sanicle, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching toward the top. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Sanicula elongata thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, rich soils."
