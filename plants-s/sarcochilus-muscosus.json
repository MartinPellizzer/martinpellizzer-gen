    "intro": "Sarcochilus muscosus, commonly known as the mossy hinged-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a pinkish hue. The plant produces a single, showy flower spike that emerges from the base of the leaves, often during the warmer months. Its name refers to the moss-like appearance of its leaves and the hinged structure of its labellum. Sarcochilus muscosus is a rare and protected species, often found in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil."
