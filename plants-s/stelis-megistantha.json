    "intro": "Stelis megistantha, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Stelis megistantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and unique floral scent."
