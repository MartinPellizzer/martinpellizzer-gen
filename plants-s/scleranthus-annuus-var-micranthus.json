    "intro": "Scleranthus annuus var. micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cocklebur, is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spiny leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its prickly nature, it can be a nuisance in agricultural settings."
