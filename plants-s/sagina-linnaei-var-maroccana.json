    "intro": "Sagina linnaei var. maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and arid regions of North Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, bright green leaves that form a mat-like structure, often carpeting the ground in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a succulent-like structure that helps store water. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
