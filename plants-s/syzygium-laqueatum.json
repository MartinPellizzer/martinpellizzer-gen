It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. The fruit's skin is thin and delicate, giving it a glassy appearance, hence its common name. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit in local markets."
