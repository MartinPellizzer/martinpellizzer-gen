It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Stevia vaga var. saltensis is adapted to saline and coastal environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are used as natural sweeteners."
