It typically features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of high-altitude ecosystems."
