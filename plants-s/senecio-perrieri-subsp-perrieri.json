It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
