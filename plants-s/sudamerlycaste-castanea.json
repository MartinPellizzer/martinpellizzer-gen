    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste castanea, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces edible nuts encased in a spiny husk, similar to those of the horse chestnut. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and disease, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
