    "intro": "Saussurea lenensis, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flower heads. The plant produces numerous ray florets that are typically yellow in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Saussurea lenensis is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of high-altitude flora and traditional medicine."
