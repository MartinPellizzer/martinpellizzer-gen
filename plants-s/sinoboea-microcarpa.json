    "intro": "Sinoboea microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sinoboea, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, yellowish fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
