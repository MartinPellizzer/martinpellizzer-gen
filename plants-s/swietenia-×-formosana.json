    "intro": "Swietenia \u00d7 formosana, commonly known as the Formosan mahogany, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Swietenia mahagoni and Swietenia macrophylla. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Taiwan, and is characterized by its slow growth and high-quality timber. The plant is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers and is valued for its durable, aromatic wood used in furniture and cabinetry."
