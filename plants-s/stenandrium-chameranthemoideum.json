It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure.
