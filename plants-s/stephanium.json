    "intro": "Stephanium, commonly known as the starflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Stephanium species often have opposite, ovate leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
