    "intro": "Styphelia splendens, commonly known as the showy wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, appearing in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its cool, moist habitat. Styphelia splendens thrives in shaded, acidic soils and is often found in coniferous forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
