    "intro": "Salsola dichracantha, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Salsola dichracantha is often found in sandy soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
