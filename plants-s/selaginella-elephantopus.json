    "intro": "Selaginella elephantopus, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Selaginella elephantopus reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic phase. This plant is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
