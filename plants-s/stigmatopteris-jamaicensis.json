    "intro": "Stigmatopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican stigmatopteris, is a fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
