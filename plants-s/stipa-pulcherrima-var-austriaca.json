It is characterized by its slender, silver-green blades and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a soft, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by the distinctive fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind.
