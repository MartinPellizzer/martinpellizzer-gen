It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white. Scleria tonduzii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
