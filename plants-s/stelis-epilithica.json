    "intro": "Stelis epilithica, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epilithic growth habit, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil. The plant typically features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Stelis epilithica is often found in shaded, humid environments on cliffs or rocky outcrops."
