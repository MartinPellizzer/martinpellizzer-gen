    "intro": "Senecio stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
