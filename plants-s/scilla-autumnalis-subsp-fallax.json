It produces clusters of pale blue or lilac flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in open woodlands, scrublands, and along coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
