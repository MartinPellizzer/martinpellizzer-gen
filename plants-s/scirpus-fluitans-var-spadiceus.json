    "intro": "Scirpus fluitans var. spadiceus, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that grow entirely above water. It produces dense clusters of small, spadix-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color and often mistaken for flowers. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or submerged depending on water levels."
