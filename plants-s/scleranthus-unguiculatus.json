    "intro": "Scleranthus unguiculatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Scleranthus unguiculatus is known for its ability to colonize open, sunny areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
