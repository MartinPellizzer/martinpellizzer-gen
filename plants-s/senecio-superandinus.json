    "intro": "Senecio superandinus, commonly known as the Andean groundsel, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, featuring silver-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces seeds in a distinctive pappus structure. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
