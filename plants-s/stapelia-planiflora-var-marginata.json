    "intro": "Stapelia planiflora var. marginata, commonly known as the Margined Stapeliad, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating to store water. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually small and reduced, as the stems perform most of the photosynthetic functions. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
