    "intro": "Sanrobertia, commonly known as the Robertson's milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in this family. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink. Sanrobertia species are generally shrubs or small trees, and they are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage and flowering habits."
