    "intro": "Solidago rugosa var. pallida, commonly known as pale rough goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and yellow, cone-shaped inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, whitish hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
