    "intro": "Struthanthus staphylinus, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. Struthanthus staphylinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh desert climates."
