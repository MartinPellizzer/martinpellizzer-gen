    "intro": "Salicornia iranica, commonly known as Persian glassworts, is a halophytic plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland salt marshes. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish or reddish in color. Salicornia iranica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
