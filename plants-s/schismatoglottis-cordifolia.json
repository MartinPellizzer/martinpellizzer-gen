It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat.
