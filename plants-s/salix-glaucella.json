    "intro": "Salix glaucella, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a distinctive silvery-green underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. Salix glaucella is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
