    "intro": "Struthiopteris lherminieri, commonly known as the Lherminier's wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
