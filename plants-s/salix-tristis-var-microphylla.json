    "intro": "Salix tristis var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or in shady woodland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
