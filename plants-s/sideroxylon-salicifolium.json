It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and lanceolate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and construction."
