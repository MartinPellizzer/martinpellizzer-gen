    "intro": "Strychnos wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's spurge or the African strychnos, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
