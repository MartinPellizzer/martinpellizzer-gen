It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has arching, slender stems that are often covered with fine, silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall.
