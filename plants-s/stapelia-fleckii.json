    "intro": "Stapelia fleckii, commonly known as the spotted carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its distinctive, meaty appearance that resembles decaying flesh. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red markings, which help attract pollinators. Stapelia fleckii is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its slow growth and ability to store water in its thick stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
