    "intro": "Scleranthus brumalis, commonly known as winter spleenwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Scleranthus brumalis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and provides nectar for early pollinators."
