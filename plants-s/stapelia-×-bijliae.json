    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 bijliae, commonly known as the hybrid starry stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, and it is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance requirements. Stapelia \u00d7 bijliae is noted for its resilience and ability to bloom reliably under proper care."
