    "intro": "Sambucus pubens f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited elderberry, is a botanical variant of the elderberry plant characterized by its distinctive yellow berries. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is native to certain regions of North America. The plant typically features compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries, which ripen in the fall, are not only ornamental but also have historical uses in traditional medicine. However, the fruit is toxic when unripe and should be handled with care."
