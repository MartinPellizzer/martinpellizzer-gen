It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones are small and reddish, often persisting on the plant for several years. Sabina deppeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
