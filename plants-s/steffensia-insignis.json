    "intro": "Steffensia insignis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense foliage that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically small, waxy, and arranged in a spiral pattern to reduce water loss. Steffensia insignis is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
