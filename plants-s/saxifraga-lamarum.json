    "intro": "Saxifraga lamarum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences at the stem tips. Saxifraga lamarum is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
