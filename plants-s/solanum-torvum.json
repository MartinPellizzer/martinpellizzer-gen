    "intro": "Solanum torvum, commonly known as the nightshade or beggar's ticks, is a perennial shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many areas."
