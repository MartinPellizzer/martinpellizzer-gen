It is a foliose lichen characterized by its closely spaced, leaf-like structures that are typically narrow and elongated. The thallus is usually green to yellow-green in color and forms dense, crust-like growths on rock surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on calcareous substrates. This subspecies is notable for its chemical composition, which includes usnic acid and other secondary metabolites."
