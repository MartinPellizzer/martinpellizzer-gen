    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum subsp. neglectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical, spiky inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
