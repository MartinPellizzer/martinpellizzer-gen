    "intro": "Senecio rochelianus, commonly known as the Rocheliana groundsels, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Georgia and Armenia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio rochelianus is considered a rare and endangered species."
