    "intro": "Stigmatosema, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, and they produce capsules as fruits. Stigmatosema species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
