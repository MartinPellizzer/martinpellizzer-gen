    "intro": "Saxifraga macrostigma var. georgeana, commonly known as the Georgeana saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and conservation areas."
