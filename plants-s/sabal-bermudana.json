    "intro": "Sabal bermudana, commonly known as the Bermuda cedar, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Bermuda Islands. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender trunk and feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and windy conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution along the shores. The wood of Sabal bermudana is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
