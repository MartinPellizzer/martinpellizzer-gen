    "intro": "Sinapis tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved mustard, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Sinapis tenuifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
