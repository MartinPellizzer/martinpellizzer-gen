    "intro": "Spinifex littoreus var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaf spinifex, is a coastal grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline environments. The plant produces wiry, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including high winds and salt spray. Its flowering spikes are typically small and inconspicuous, appearing in late winter to early spring. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
