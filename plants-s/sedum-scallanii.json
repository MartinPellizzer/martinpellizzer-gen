    "intro": "Sedum scallanii, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum scallanii is also known for its ability to propagate easily through stem cuttings."
