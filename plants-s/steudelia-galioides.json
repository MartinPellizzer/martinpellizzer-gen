    "intro": "Steudelia galioides, commonly known as the coastal galiopsis, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and beaches, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Steudelia galioides produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
