    "intro": "Salix ishidoyana, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies."
