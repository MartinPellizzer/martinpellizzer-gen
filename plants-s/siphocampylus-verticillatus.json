    "intro": "Siphocampylus verticillatus, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Siphocampylus verticillatus is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
