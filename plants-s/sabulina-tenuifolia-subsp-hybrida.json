    "intro": "Sabulina tenuifolia subsp. hybrida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical structure reflects evolutionary adaptations to harsh environmental conditions."
