    "intro": "Selaginella quartiniana, commonly known as the Quartin\u2019s spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella quartiniana is known for its resilience and ability to survive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
