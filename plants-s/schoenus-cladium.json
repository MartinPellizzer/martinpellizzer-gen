    "intro": "Schoenus cladium, commonly known as the swamp grass or water couch, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal and inland wetlands. Schoenus cladium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
