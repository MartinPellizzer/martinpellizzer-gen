The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and it features glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. Its leaves are generally ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of these hairs. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and are adapted for pollination by birds or insects."
