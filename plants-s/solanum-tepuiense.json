It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, tomatoes, and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in the high-altitude, humid environments of the tepuis, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
