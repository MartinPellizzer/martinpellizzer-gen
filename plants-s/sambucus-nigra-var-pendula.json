    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of white flowers that appear in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its bark is smooth and grayish in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful appearance. The berries are edible but should be consumed with caution as they can be toxic in large quantities."
