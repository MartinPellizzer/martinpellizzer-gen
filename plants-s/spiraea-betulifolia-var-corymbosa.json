    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, arching stems with small, ovate leaves that have a serrated margin and a pale green underside. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and showy floral display."
