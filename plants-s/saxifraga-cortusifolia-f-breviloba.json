    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia f. breviloba, commonly known as the short-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its hirsute foliage and delicate flowers make it a distinctive and hardy addition to rock gardens."
