    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. heterochroa, commonly known as the white meadow spiraea, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and a dark green upper surface. This variety is distinguished by its two-toned flowers, which have a lighter color at the base and a darker hue towards the center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks."
