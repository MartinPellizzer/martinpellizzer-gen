    "intro": "Stipa vaginata f. rigida, commonly known as rigid false oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense panicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand environmental stress."
