    "intro": "Syzygium paraiense, commonly known as the red sandalwood or *Pahangian* in some regions, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet and tart flavor. Syzygium paraiense is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
