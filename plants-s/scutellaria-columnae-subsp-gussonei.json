    "intro": "Scutellaria columnae subsp. gussonei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually blue or purple in color. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its alpine environment."
