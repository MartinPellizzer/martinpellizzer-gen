    "intro": "Searsia pyroides var. pyroides, commonly known as the silver tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. The silver tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
