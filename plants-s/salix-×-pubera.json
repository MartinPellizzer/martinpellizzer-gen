    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pubera, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix \u00d7 pubera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
