    "intro": "Scabiosa integrata, commonly known as the common honesty, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a hairy, pappus-like structure, which aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and serrated edges. Scabiosa integrata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
