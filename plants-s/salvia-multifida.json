    "intro": "Salvia multifida, commonly known as the broad-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Salvia multifida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to both ornamental gardens and native plant landscapes."
