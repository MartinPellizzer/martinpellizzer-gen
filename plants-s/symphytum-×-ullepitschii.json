    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 ullepitschii, commonly known as the Russian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments. Due to its rapid growth and nutrient-rich roots, it has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine."
