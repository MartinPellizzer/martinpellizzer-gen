    "intro": "Santaloides, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Santalaceae. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The wood of Santaloides species is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Their unique ecological role makes them important in forest ecosystems."
