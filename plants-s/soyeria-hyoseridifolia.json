    "intro": "Soyeria hyoseridifolia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Soyeria hyoseridifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
