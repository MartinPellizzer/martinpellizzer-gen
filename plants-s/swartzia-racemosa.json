    "intro": "Swartzia racemosa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in lowland tropical forests. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its valuable timber, it is also listed as an endangered species in some regions."
