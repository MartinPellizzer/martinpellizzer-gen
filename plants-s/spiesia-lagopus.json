    "intro": "Spiesia lagopus, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. Spiesia lagopus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is a food source for certain herbivores."
