    "intro": "Solanum viarum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers, followed by small, toxic berries that mature to a yellowish-orange color. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
