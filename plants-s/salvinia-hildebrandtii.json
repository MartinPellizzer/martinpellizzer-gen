    "intro": "Salvinia hildebrandtii, commonly known as the water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
