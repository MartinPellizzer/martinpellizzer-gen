    "intro": "Sesleria varia var. pseudoelongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive reddish hue, especially at the base, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valued addition to cultivated landscapes."
