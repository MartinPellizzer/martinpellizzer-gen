    "intro": "Solidago rugosa subsp. aspera, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flower heads in late summer to early autumn, which are composed of numerous small disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in moist to wet soils in open habitats such as wetlands, meadows, and stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
