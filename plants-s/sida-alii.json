    "intro": "Sida alii, commonly known as the \"sicklepod\" or \"painted cup,\" is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow center. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Sida alii is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates."
