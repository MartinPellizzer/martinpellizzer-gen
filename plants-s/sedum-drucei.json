    "intro": "Sedum drucei, commonly known as the Druce's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, upright pedicels. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Sedum drucei is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
