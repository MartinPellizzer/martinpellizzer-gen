    "intro": "Silene dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stalked catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Silene dolichocarpa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations."
