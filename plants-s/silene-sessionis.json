    "intro": "Silene sessionis, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Silene sessionis is also known for its ability to thrive in salt spray and strong coastal winds."
