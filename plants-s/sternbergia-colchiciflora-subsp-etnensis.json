    "intro": "Sternbergia colchiciflora subsp. etnensis, commonly known as the Etna Sternbergia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the volcanic regions of Sicily. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing pale yellow or white petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of Mount Etna. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
