    "intro": "Sponia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran sponia, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically brightly colored. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are ovate and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sponia sumatrana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
