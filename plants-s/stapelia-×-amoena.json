    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 amoena, commonly known as the hybrid starfish plant, is a succulent hybrid resulting from the cross between Stapelia hirtella and Stapelia pillansii. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that resemble small, fleshy stars, often with a yellow or orange hue. The plant produces thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically fragrant and open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Stapelia \u00d7 amoena is prized for its unusual appearance and is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
