It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets. It produces delicate white or pale blue flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Sesleria orbelica is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
