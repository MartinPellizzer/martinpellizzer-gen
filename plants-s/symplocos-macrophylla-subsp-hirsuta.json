It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that are followed by dark purple berries. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
