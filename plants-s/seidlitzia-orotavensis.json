    "intro": "Seidlitzia orotavensis, commonly known as the Orotava fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seidlitzia orotavensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
