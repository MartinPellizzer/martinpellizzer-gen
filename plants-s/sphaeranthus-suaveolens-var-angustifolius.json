    "intro": "Sphaeranthus suaveolens var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is often found growing in sandy soils along roadsides and in disturbed areas."
