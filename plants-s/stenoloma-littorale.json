    "intro": "Stenoloma littorale, commonly known as the coastal sword fern, is a perennial fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and tidal zones, demonstrating a strong adaptation to saline environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Stenoloma littorale plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
