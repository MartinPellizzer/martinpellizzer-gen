    "intro": "Struthiola striata, commonly known as the striped sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Struthiola striata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in conditions of low rainfall and high temperatures."
