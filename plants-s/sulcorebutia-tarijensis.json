It is a small, compact cactus with a short, thick stem and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant features areoles, which are specialized stem structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
