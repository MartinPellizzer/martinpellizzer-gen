    "intro": "Scleria hirta, commonly known as the hairy speargrass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in short hairs, giving it its common name. Scleria hirta typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
