    "intro": "Solidago multiradiata subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant produces yellow inflorescences composed of numerous small, ray-like flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
