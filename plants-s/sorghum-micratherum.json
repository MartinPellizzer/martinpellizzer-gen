    "intro": "Sorghum micratherum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small-statured grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny grains, which are typically used for animal feed. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is often cultivated in dryland conditions. Due to its drought tolerance, it is an important forage crop in arid and semi-arid regions."
