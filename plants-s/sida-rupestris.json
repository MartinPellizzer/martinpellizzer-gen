    "intro": "Sida rupestris, commonly known as rock sida, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs. Sida rupestris thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
