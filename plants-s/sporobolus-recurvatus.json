    "intro": "Sporobolus recurvatus, commonly known as the bentleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Sporobolus recurvatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
