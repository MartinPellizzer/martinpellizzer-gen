    "intro": "Smilax subsessiliflora var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant has compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often with a waxy upper surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in branched inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. This variety is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
