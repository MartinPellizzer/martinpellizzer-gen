    "intro": "Sophora australis, commonly known as the Australian wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
