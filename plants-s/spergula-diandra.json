It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets and bloom in early summer. Spergula diandra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
