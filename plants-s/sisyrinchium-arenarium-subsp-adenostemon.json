    "intro": "Sisyrinchium arenarium subsp. adenostemon, commonly known as the desert blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its floral structure includes showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
