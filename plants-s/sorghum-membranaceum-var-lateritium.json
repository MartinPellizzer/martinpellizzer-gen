    "intro": "Sorghum membranaceum var. lateritium, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a drought-tolerant grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces panicles of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its fibrous stems are used in traditional construction and as a source of thatching. This variety is valued for its resilience and ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
