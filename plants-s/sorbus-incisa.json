    "intro": "Sorbus incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn a striking yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland or hedgerow habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
