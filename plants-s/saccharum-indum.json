    "intro": "Saccharum indum, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fibrous leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often adorned with fine, hairy bracts. Its fibrous structure makes it valuable for use in thatching and basket weaving. Saccharum indum is also sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal."
