    "intro": "Santaloides desmos, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, waxy flowers. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize effectively. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly threatened by deforestation and habitat loss."
