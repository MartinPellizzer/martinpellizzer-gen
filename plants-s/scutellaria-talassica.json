    "intro": "Scutellaria talassica, commonly known as the coastal skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. The plant features upright, slender stems with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually blue or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Scutellaria talassica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
