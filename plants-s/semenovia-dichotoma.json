    "intro": "Semenovia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that bear clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Semenovia dichotoma plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
