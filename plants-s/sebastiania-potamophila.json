    "intro": "Sebastiania potamophila, commonly known as the river Sebastiania, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are typically concealed within cup-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments near streams and riverbanks, where it often forms dense, low-growing mats. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
