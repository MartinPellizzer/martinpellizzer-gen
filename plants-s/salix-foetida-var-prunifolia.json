    "intro": "Salix foetida var. prunifolia, commonly known as the sweet willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge, and turn a striking yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
