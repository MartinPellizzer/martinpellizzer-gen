    "intro": "Silene foliosa, commonly known as the leafy catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats. The plant is herbaceous, with a short, stout stem that bears the flowers at the top. It is known for its ability to self-pollinate and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
