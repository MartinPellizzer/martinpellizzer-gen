    "intro": "Stipa glabrinoda, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Its leaves are narrow and glabrous, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Stipa glabrinoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats."
