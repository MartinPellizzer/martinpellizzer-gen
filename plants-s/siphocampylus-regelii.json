It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
