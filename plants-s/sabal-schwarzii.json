    "intro": "Sabal schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwarz palm, is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage as a gymnosperm. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
