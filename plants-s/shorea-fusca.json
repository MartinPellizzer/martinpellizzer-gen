    "intro": "Shorea fusca, commonly known as black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark bark and is often found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soil. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture making. Shorea fusca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
