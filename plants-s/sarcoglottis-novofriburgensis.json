    "intro": "Sarcoglottis novofriburgensis, commonly known as the Fribourghorn orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests at high elevations. Its unique morphology includes a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
