    "intro": "Stellaria media var. brauniana, commonly known as white sandstar, is a variant of the common chickweed. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, white flowers and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. This plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as lawns, gardens, and along roadsides. Its botanical features include a slender stem, hairy surfaces, and small, five-petaled flowers. It is often mistaken for the common chickweed due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its lighter coloration and specific habitat preferences."
