It features dense, dark green foliage with cylindrical, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in muddy or waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
