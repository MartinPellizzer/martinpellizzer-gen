    "intro": "Sisymbrium columnae var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and thread-like stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes or other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, facilitating its propagation. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth and health of its host plants."
