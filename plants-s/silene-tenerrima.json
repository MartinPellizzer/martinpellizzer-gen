    "intro": "Silene tenerrima, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds via the wind. Silene tenerrima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for desert wildlife."
