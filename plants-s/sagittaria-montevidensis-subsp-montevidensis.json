    "intro": "Sagittaria montevidensis subsp. montevidensis, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Sagittaria montevidensis subsp. montevidensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
