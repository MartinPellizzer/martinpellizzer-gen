    "intro": "Stenandrium radicosum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Stenandrium radicosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
