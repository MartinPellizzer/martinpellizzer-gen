It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for succulent enthusiasts."
