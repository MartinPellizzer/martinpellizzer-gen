    "intro": "Satyrium longicolle, commonly known as the long-headed satyrium, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters and are known for their delicate, often fragrant appearance. The orchid produces showy, violet to purple-colored blooms that attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
