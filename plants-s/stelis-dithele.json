    "intro": "Stelis dithele, commonly known as the two-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single, short stem and two opposite leaves. Its flowers are typically small, white or pale green, and clustered in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth."
