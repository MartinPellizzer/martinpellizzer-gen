    "intro": "Stellaster saxatilis, commonly known as the rock starburst, is a species of star-shaped sea urchin found in rocky coastal areas. It belongs to the family Toxopneustidae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, star-like body structure. The plant, or more accurately the echinoderm, has a central disc surrounded by long, slender spines that provide protection. It thrives in shallow, turbulent waters where it can anchor itself to rocky substrates. Its unique morphology makes it an important part of marine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for various predators."
