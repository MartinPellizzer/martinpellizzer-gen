    "intro": "Salvia cuspidata subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branching stems covered in gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces striking violet to purple flower clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
