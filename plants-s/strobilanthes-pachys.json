    "intro": "Strobilanthes pachys, commonly known as the thick-leaved flame flower, is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that display vibrant red and orange hues, typical of the genus Strobilanthes. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in humid climates. The species is noted for its seasonal blooming, with flowers appearing in late summer to early autumn."
