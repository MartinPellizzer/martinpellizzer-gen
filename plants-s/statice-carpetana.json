It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardy nature. Statice carpetana is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
