It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds and insects.
