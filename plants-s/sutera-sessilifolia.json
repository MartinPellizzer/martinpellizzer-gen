It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant has simple, sessile leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
