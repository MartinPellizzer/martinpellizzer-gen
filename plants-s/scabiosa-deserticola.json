    "intro": "Scabiosa deserticola, commonly known as the desert scabious, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Scabiosa deserticola is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
