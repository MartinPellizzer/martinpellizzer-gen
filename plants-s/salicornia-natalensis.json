    "intro": "Salicornia natalensis, commonly known as Natal glassworts, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of South Africa. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and salty conditions. Its small, green flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Salicornia natalensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
