    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 garbariorum, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Serapias aucubiana and Serapias himalayana. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wet meadows and marshes of the Alps and surrounding regions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive hooded labellum that distinguishes it from other orchid species. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
