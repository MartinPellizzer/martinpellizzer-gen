    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. pubens, commonly known as the hairy elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and a dense panicle of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The hairy elderberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
