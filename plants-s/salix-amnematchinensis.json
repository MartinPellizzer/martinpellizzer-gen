    "intro": "Salix amnematchinensis, commonly known as the Amnematchin willow, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of northern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
