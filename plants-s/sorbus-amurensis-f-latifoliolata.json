    "intro": "Sorbus amurensis f. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed whitebeam, is a variant of the Amur whitebeam, characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly found in regions of China and the Russian Far East. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in reforestation projects."
