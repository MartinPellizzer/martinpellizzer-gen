    "intro": "Struthiopteris binervis, commonly known as the two-veined wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive two-veined structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Struthiopteris binervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
