    "intro": "Sedum spirale, commonly known as the spiral sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact, spiral arrangement. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink to purple flowers in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum spirale is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
