    "intro": "Salix lasiolepis f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy on both sides. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
