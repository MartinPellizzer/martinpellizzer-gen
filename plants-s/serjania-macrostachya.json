    "intro": "Serjania macrostachya, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Serjania, which includes several species of woody plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
