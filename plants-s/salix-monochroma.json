    "intro": "Salix monochroma, commonly known as the single-flowered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
