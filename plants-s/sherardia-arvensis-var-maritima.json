    "intro": "Sherardia arvensis var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the shores of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of silvery, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
