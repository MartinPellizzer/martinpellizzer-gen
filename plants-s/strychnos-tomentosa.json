    "intro": "Strychnos tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and ovate, leathery leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates, though it prefers well-drained soils. The species is also notable for its potential medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
