    "intro": "Streptopus roseus var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Stellariaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped flowers and slender, elongated stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
