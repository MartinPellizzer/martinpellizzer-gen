    "intro": "Sesleria coerulans f. korabensis, commonly known as the Korab mountain sesleria, is a rare and distinctive grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often adorned with a fine, silvery-blue sheen, giving it a unique visual appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
