    "intro": "Salix aurita var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are elongated, alternate, and often covered with a fine, silky down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
