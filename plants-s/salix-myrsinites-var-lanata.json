    "intro": "Salix myrsinites var. lanata, commonly known as woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silky white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
