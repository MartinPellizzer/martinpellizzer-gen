    "intro": "Selaginella schmidtii var. krauseorum, commonly known as the Krause's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its compact, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
