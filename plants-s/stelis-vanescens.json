    "intro": "Stelis vanescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
