    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 kaufmannii, commonly known as the red-tongued pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant's vibrant red coloration, often with a yellow or orange throat, serves as an attractant for prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Sarracenia \u00d7 kaufmannii is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
