    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. erythropus, commonly known as the red-stemmed pitcher plant, is a variant of the yellow pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red stems and orange-red pitchers that are often adorned with dark red veins. The plant is a carnivorous species that traps and digests insects using its modified leaves, which form deep, tubular structures. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in the Sarraceniaceae family."
