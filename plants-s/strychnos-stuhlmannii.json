    "intro": "Strychnos stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, red aril. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or scrubland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
