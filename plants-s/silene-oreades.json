    "intro": "Silene oreades, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene oreades is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments where few plants can survive."
