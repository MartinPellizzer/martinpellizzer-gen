    "intro": "Smilax caudata, commonly known as the catbriar or redroot smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often armed with spines, and its compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Smilax caudata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its purported health benefits."
