    "intro": "Stemodia reliquiarum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent stems and small, ephemeral flowers that appear only briefly at night. The plant's botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching structure that allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thin and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, Stemodia reliquiarum is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
