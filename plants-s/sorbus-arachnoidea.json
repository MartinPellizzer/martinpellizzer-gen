    "intro": "Sorbus arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-tailed dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, catkin-like inflorescences that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Sorbus arachnoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
