    "intro": "Sesbania tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged sesbania, is a fast-growing leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves with four pairs of elliptical leaflets and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for soil improvement and as a forage crop. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
