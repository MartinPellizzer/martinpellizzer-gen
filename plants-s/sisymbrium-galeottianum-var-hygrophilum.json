    "intro": "Sisymbrium galeottianum var. hygrophilum, commonly known as the water cabbage or water radish, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. This variety is often found in association with other wetland flora and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic life."
