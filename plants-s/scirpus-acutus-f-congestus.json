    "intro": "Scirpus acutus f. congestus, commonly known as the dense flatsedge, is a variant of the common flatsedge native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in marshy areas and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. This form is notable for its compact growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
