    "intro": "Schepperia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a unique species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This epiphytic plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stems for photosynthesis. It produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual contrast to its leafless form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its unusual morphology makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a prized addition to specialized orchid collections."
