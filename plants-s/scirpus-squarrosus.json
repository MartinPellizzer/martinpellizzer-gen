    "intro": "Scirpus squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers at the top of the stem, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and improve water retention in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus squarrosus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
