    "intro": "Stellera cilicica, commonly known as the Cyprus starwort, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a reddish tinge. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Stellera cilicica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
