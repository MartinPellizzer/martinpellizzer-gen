    "intro": "Sempervivum erythraeum, commonly known as the red-leaf houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features rosettes of fleshy, often reddish or bronze-colored leaves that store water, aiding its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched stems with small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, though it may go dormant in winter."
