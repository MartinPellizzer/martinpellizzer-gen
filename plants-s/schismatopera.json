    "intro": "Schismatopera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with a distinctive purple or pink coloration. Schismatopera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These plants are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
