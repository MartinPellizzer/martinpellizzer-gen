It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
