    "intro": "Soliva daucifolia, commonly known as field hawksbeard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Soliva daucifolia is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
