    "intro": "Selaginella vernicosa var. oligoclada, commonly known as the glossy spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a dense rosette of narrow, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered with a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on specialized stems called sporophylls. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy substrates. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in xeriscapes."
