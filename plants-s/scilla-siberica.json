    "intro": "Scilla siberica, commonly known as Siberian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe. It produces clusters of striking blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in gardens. Scilla siberica prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
