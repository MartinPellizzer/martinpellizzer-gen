    "intro": "Sarracenia psittacina var. okefenokeensis, commonly known as the Okefenokee swamp pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features tall, red-brown pitchers with a distinctive green stripe running down the center. The plant thrives in boggy, nutrient-poor environments, using its modified leaves to trap and digest insects. Its flowers are typically pale pink to white, with a short, narrow spur. The variety is notable for its robust growth and ability to withstand seasonal flooding."
