    "intro": "Selinum myrrhis, commonly known as cow parsley or wild chervil, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Selinum myrrhis is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
