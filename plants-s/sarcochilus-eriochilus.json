    "intro": "Sarcochilus eriochilus, commonly known as the wooly leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and hairy rhizomes, which help it survive in its native environment. The plant produces a single, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a loose spike, and bloom during the summer months. Sarcochilus eriochilus is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils, often in damp, shaded areas."
