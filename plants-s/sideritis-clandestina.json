    "intro": "Sideritis clandestina, commonly known as the secret ironwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
