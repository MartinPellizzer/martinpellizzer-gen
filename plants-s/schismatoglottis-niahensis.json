    "intro": "Schismatoglottis niahensis, commonly known as the Niah Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves and produces inflorescences that bear numerous small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
