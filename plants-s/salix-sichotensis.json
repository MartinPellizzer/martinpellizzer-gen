    "intro": "Salix sichotensis, commonly known as the Sichoteng shrub willow, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Russia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in alpine or subalpine zones. The plant is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Salix sichotensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
