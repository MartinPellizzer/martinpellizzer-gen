    "intro": "Salix mauriana, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to seasonal flooding. The bark of Salix mauriana is smooth and grayish, with some varieties developing a reddish tint as they mature."
