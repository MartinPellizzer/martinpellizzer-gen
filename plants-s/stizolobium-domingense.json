    "intro": "Stizolobium domingense, commonly known as the Dominican acacia, is a leguminous shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry or disturbed soils. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
