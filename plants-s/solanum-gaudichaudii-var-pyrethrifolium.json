    "intro": "Solanum gaudichaudii var. pyrethrifolium, commonly known as the pyrethrum-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of pyrethrum plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
