    "intro": "Siphonostegia, commonly known as the \"false senna,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive siphonostelic stems, which have a hollow, tube-like structure in the central part of the stem. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central axis. Siphonostegia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. They produce small, yellow or greenish flowers clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds."
