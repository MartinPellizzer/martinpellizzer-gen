    "intro": "Statice tuberculata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and floral arrangements. Statice tuberculata is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
