    "intro": "Solanum incisum var. paucilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dark green, ovate leaves with shallow lobes and a hairy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. Its berries are typically yellow or red, containing toxic alkaloids similar to other members of the Solanaceae family. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
