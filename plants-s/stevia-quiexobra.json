    "intro": "Stevia quiexobra, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in heads, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stevia quiexobra is valued not only for its sweet taste but also for its potential health benefits and use in herbal medicine."
