It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its botanical features make it a hardy and visually appealing plant for alpine gardens."
