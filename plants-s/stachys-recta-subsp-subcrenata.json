    "intro": "Stachys recta subsp. subcrenata, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
