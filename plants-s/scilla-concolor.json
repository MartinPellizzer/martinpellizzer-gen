    "intro": "Scilla concolor, commonly known as the common scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Scilla concolor is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread easily in suitable conditions."
