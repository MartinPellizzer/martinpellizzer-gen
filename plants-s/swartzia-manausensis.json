    "intro": "Swartzia manausensis, commonly known as Manaus wood or Manaus rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. Swartzia manausensis is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its high-quality timber. However, due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
