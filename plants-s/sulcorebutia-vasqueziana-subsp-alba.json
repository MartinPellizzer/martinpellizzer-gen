It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to white-colored stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
