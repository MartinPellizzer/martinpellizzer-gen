    "intro": "Sclerochloa patens, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its flat, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Sclerochloa patens is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
