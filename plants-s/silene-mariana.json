    "intro": "Silene mariana, commonly known as the Mariana catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mariana in the Pacific Ocean. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
