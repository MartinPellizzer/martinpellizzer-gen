It is characterized by its large, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered a striking example of alpine flora."
