    "intro": "Salsola hortensis, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with small, spiny leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America, where it often becomes a weed. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Salsola hortensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind."
