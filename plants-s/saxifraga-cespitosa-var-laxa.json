    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. laxa, commonly known as the loose saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to cold climates. This variety is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and mountain slopes."
