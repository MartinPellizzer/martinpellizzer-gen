    "intro": "Saxifraga laurentiana, commonly known as Laurentian saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, which help protect it from moisture loss. Saxifraga laurentiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
