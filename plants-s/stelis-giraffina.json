    "intro": "Stelis giraffina, commonly known as the giraffe orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that resemble the pattern of a giraffe's coat. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually white or pale green with intricate markings, and it blooms during the rainy season. Stelis giraffina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
