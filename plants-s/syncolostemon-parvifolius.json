    "intro": "Syncolostemon parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved synbranch, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Syncolostemon parvifolius thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
