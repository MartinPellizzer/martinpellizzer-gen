    "intro": "Symplocos cochinchinensis var. schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's evergreen holly, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
