    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum subvar. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, typically growing in dense clusters at the water's edge. The plant produces yellowish-green flower spikes that appear in late summer, followed by spiky, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in the northern hemisphere. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
