    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. lanata, commonly known as woolly santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in a fine, woolly coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy and easy-to-care-for plant."
