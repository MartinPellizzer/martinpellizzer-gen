    "intro": "Sciaphila inornata, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which it uses to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Sciaphila inornata is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
