    "intro": "Sphinctanthus rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Sphinctanthus rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
