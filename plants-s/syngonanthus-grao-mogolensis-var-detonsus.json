    "intro": "Syngonanthus grao-mogolensis var. detonsus, commonly known as the Brazilian grass or Brazilian sprout grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This grass is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
