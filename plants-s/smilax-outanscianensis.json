    "intro": "Smilax outanscianensis, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot or arrowleaf smilax, is a climbing shrub native to South America. It features a robust, woody stem with thorned nodes and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid forests and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
