    "intro": "Salix schweinfurthii, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense mats or cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hair. Salix schweinfurthii thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its resilience to cold temperatures and limited growing season makes it an important component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
