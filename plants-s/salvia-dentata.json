    "intro": "Salvia dentata, commonly known as the toothed sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia dentata is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
