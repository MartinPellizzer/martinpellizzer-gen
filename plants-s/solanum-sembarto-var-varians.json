    "intro": "Solanum sembarto var. varians, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes confused with other Solanum species."
