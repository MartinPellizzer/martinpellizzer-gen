    "intro": "Saxifraga squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against harsh cold and wind. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes. Saxifraga squarrosa is a hardy species adapted to extreme environments, making it a symbol of resilience in botanical studies."
