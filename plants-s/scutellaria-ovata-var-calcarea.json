    "intro": "Scutellaria ovata var. calcarea, commonly known as the calcarea blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. This variety is distinguished by its calcareous soil preference, which influences its growth and distribution."
