    "intro": "Sphaeralcea exilis, commonly known as the slender globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sphaeralcea exilis is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
