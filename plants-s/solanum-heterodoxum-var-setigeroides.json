    "intro": "Solanum heterodoxum var. setigeroides, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a species native to parts of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its pubescent stems and leaves, which are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
