It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Schmaltzia hederacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
