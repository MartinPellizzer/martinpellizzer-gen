    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and alpine displays."
