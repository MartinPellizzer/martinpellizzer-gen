    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 eudoxiana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in subalpine and alpine zones. The plant features dense, mat-forming growth with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga \u00d7 eudoxiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
