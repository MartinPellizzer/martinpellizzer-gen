    "intro": "Succisa palustris, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are typically hairy and erect. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Succisa palustris plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a critical food source for their larvae."
