    "intro": "Sophronitis sincorana, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sophronitis sincorana is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in its native habitat."
