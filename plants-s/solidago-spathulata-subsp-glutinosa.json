    "intro": "Solidago spathulata subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its inflorescences are typically arranged in a panicle shape, with each flower head surrounded by a leaf-like bract. The subspecies is distinguished by its sticky, resinous secretions on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
