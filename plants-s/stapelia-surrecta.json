    "intro": "Stapelia surrecta, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to produce a milky sap when damaged. Stapelia surrecta is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
