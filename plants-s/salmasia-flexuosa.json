    "intro": "Salmasia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible salvia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often sprawling stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Salmasia flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
