    "intro": "Selaginella praestans, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. Selaginella praestans is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and ferns."
