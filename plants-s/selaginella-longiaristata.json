    "intro": "Selaginella longiaristata, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Selaginella longiaristata is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in certain habitats."
