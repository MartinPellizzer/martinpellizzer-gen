It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Stipa mundula is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
