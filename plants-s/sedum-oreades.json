It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and can store water to help it survive in arid climates. Sedum oreades is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
