    "intro": "Stanhopea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian stanhopea, is a tropical orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant purple or violet color with intricate patterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its high-altitude, cool climate. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil. Stanhopea peruviana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
