    "intro": "Sorghum verticilliflorum var. ornatum, commonly known as the ornamental sorghum, is a striking grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its showy, feathery inflorescences that range in color from white to pink and even purple. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are clustered in dense, whorled arrangements along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to provide visual interest throughout the growing season further enhance its appeal in horticultural settings."
