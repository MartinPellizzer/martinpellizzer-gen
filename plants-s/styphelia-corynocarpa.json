It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy soils and coastal heathland environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, often covered in a fine, silvery coating. Styphelia corynocarpa is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray."
