It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that often resemble horns. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure, including a prominent lip that is often brightly colored. Stanhopea bucephalus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and rarity."
