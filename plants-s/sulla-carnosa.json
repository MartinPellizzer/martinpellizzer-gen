    "intro": "Sulla carnosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Sulla carnosa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
