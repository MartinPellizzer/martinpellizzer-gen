    "intro": "Salvia urolepis, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, powdery blue-gray bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Salvia urolepis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
