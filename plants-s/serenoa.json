    "intro": "Serenoa, commonly known as the saw palmetto, is a shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its fan-shaped leaves and small, berry-like fruits. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in wetlands and hammocks. Its fruits are typically harvested for their potential medicinal properties. The botanical name Serenoa repens reflects its creeping growth habit and the presence of small, sharp spines on its leaves."
