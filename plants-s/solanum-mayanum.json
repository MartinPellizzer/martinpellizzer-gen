    "intro": "Solanum mayanum, commonly known as Mayan nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, green berries, which turn red when ripe. Its berries contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
