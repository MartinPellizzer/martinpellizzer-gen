    "intro": "Stenostomum abbreviatum subsp. moaensis, commonly known as the Maori flatleaf, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its flat, leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
