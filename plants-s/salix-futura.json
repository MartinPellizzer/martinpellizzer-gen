    "intro": "Salix futura, commonly known as the future willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in the early spring. Salix futura is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in moist environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
