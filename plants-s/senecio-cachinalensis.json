    "intro": "Senecio cachinalensis, commonly known as the Cachinalensis Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio cachinalensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
