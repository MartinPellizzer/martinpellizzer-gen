    "intro": "Savastania, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their small, clustered flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, purple, and white. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in a compact, shrub-like form. Savastania species are well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and thrive in full sun. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the year in suitable climates."
