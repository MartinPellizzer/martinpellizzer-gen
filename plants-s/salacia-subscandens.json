    "intro": "Salacia subscandens, commonly known as the climbing salacia, is a member of the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars. It is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical rainforests of countries like India and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its elongated, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Despite its ornamental potential, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements."
