    "intro": "Salix stylosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Salix stylosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
