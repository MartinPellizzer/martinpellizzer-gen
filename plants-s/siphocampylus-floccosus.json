    "intro": "Siphocampylus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, fluffy seed heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
