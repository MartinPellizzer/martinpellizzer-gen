    "intro": "Setaria imberbis f. setislongioribus, commonly known as the long-hair panicgrass, is a variant of the panicgrass species characterized by its elongated, hairy awns. This grass is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
