    "intro": "Stachys grandifolia, commonly known as large-leaved hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Stachys grandifolia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its hairy leaves and clustered flowers make it a distinctive species within the mint family, Lamiaceae."
