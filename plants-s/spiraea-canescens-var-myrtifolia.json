    "intro": "Spiraea canescens var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring arching branches that create a cascading effect. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are elliptical, with a slightly serrated edge, and have a soft, silvery-gray underside. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its elegant, flowing form."
