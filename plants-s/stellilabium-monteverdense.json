The plant belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to changes in its microclimate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in its native region."
