    "intro": "Statice floribunda, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments. The plant produces spikes of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice floribunda is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
