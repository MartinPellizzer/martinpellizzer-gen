    "intro": "Smilax ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a vine-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth habit, which help it climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Smilax ehrenbergiana is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
