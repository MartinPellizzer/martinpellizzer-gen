    "intro": "Symphonia globulifera var. gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon ebony, is a species of tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood and thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, black fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments and is valued for its high-quality timber. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
