    "intro": "Stilbe procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate stilbe, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and knotweed. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, greenish flowers in late spring. Stilbe procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
