    "intro": "Solanum fallax, commonly known as the wild nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Solanum fallax is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
