    "intro": "Statice spicata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically gray-green in color, and it is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms. Statice spicata is also valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
