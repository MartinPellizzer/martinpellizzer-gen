    "intro": "Stenanthera squamuligera, commonly known as the woolly rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Stenanthera squamuligera is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in its native range."
