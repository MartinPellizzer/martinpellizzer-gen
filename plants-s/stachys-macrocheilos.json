    "intro": "Stachys macrocheilos, commonly known as the large-flowered hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in soft, glandular hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils, and it is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Stachys macrocheilos is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
