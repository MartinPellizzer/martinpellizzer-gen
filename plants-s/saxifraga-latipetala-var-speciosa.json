It features rosettes of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
