    "intro": "Salix huartina, commonly known as Huart's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female, with the female flowers being more prominent. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
