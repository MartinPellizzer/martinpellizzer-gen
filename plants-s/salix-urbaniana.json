    "intro": "Salix urbaniana, commonly known as the urban willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways or in urban environments. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
