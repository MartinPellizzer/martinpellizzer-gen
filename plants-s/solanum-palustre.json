    "intro": "Solanum palustre, commonly known as swamp nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture, and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple. Its berries are typically yellow or orange when mature and contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. Solanum palustre plays a role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various insects and serving as a food source for some wildlife."
