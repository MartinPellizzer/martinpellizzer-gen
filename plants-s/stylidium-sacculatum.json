    "intro": "Stylidium sacculatum, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a specialized lip that functions as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, and it blooms during the cooler months of the year. Stylidium sacculatum is a member of the orchid family and exhibits a fascinating adaptation for attracting and trapping pollinators."
