It is native to arid regions of Central Asia and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss, and its small white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like structures. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
