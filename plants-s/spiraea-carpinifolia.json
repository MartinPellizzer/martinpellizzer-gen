    "intro": "Spiraea carpinifolia, commonly known as the goat willow or hill spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring upright stems with small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its flowers are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, a characteristic feature of the Spiraea genus. Spiraea carpinifolia is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
