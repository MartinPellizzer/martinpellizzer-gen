    "intro": "Styrax prunifolius, commonly known as sweet birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant, wintergreen-like scent when scraped. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning vibrant yellow in the fall. Styrax prunifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys."
