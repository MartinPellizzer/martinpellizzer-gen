    "intro": "Streptanthus vernalis, commonly known as the spring streptanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This annual plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. The plant has a compact growth habit and is characterized by its glandular hairs, which give it a slightly sticky texture."
