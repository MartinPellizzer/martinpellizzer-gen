    "intro": "Stocksia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plants typically have basal rosettes of linear, grass-like leaves and produce showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pink petals. Stocksia species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their ability to thrive in dry conditions."
