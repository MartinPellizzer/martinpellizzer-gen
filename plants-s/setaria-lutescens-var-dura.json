    "intro": "Setaria lutescens var. dura, commonly known as stiff bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale yellow to brown florets. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Setaria lutescens var. dura is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in dryland agriculture."
