    "intro": "Sambucus pubens var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have a pubescent surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by berries that mature to a white or pale yellow color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its unique white berries, which set it apart from other elderberry species."
