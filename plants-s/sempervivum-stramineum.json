    "intro": "Sempervivum stramineum, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, silver-green leaves that form a rosette shape, providing a compact and decorative appearance. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. Sempervivum stramineum is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
