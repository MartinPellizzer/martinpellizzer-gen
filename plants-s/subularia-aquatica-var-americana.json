    "intro": "Subularia aquatica var. americana, commonly known as the American water spire, is a small, aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rosette-like structure with narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in late summer. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation."
