    "intro": "Sherardia arvensis var. mutica, commonly known as the rough field gentian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. It has rough, hairy leaves and a short, stout stem. The flowers are tubular with two lips, and the plant is often used in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators."
