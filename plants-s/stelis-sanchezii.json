    "intro": "Stelis sanchezii, commonly known as the Sanchez's spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling spider webs, hence its common name. Stelis sanchezii thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
