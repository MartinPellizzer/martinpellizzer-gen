    "intro": "Styphelia obtecta, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Styphelia obtecta thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment. It is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
