    "intro": "Santalum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Santalaceae. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that grows in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, simple leaves, and small white or yellowish flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. The wood of Santalum crassifolium is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and fragrance industries."
