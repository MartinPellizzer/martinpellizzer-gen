    "intro": "Stipa airoides, commonly known as the silvergrass or hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-hued leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Stipa airoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
