    "intro": "Stachys germanica var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in soft, glandular hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and they emit a mild, mint-like aroma when crushed. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
