    "intro": "Salix praecox var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often found in moist or wet environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands."
