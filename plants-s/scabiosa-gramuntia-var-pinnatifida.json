It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and finely divided, pinnatifid (feather-like) leaves. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to wildflower gardens."
