    "intro": "Schistostephium hippiifolium, commonly known as the horse-leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Schistostephium hippiifolium is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
