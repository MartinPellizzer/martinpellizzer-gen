    "intro": "Saponaria vaccaria f. grohii, commonly known as the pink soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, pink or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It is known for its mild saponin content, which gives it a soapy texture when crushed. This cultivar is often grown in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
