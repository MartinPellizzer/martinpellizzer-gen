    "intro": "Smilax oxycarpa, commonly known as the sharp-lobed smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a climbing habit with thorny stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Smilax oxycarpa is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
