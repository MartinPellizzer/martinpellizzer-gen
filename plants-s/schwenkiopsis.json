    "intro": "Schwenkiopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of a single species, Schwenkiopsis moniliformis, native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. It is a herbaceous perennial that grows in moist, shaded environments. The botanical interest in Schwenkiopsis lies in its unusual floral structure and its role in ecological studies of tropical flora."
