    "intro": "Salix anisandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix anisandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
