    "intro": "Selaginella rhizophora, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous stem system, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often have a distinct midrib, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Selaginella rhizophora is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
