    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. capitata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or brown at the edges, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near waterways, ponds, or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
