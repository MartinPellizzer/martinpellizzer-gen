It typically features slender, branching stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows."
