    "intro": "Spergula pentandra var. linicola, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging wetland conditions."
