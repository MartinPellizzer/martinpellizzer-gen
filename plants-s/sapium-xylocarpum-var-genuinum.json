    "intro": "Sapium xylocarpum var. genuinum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences. The tree bears woody, capsule-like fruits that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of tallow for candlemaking."
