    "intro": "Sorbus dunnii, commonly known as the Dunns rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
