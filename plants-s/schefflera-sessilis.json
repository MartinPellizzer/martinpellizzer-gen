    "intro": "Schefflera sessilis, commonly known as the broad-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Schefflera sessilis is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
