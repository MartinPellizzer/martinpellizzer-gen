    "intro": "Serapias nurrica, commonly known as the Sicilian marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist and acidic soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in coastal areas of Sicily and southern Italy. Serapias nurrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of ecological importance in its native habitats."
