    "intro": "Stapelia elegans, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a trait evolved to attract pollinators like flies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in small, white bumps that help reduce water loss. Stapelia elegans is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
