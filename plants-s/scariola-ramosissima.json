    "intro": "Scariola ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy scariola, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Scariola ramosissima is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
