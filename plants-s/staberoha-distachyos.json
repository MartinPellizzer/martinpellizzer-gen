    "intro": "Staberoha distachyos, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in three rows, characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, triangular seeds. Staberoha distachyos plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
