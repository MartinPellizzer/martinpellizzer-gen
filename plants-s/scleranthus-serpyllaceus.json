    "intro": "Scleranthus serpyllaceus, commonly known as common scurvygrass, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, while the fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds. Scleranthus serpyllaceus is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
