    "intro": "Stenophragma mollipilum, commonly known as the woolly stenophragma, is a shrub native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and helps protect it from excessive moisture loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture with a waxy coating. Stenophragma mollipilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
