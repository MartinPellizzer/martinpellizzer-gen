    "intro": "Sporobolus marginatus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Botanically, it is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
