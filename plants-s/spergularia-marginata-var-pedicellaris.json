    "intro": "Spergularia marginata var. pedicellaris, commonly known as the pink sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water, aiding in its survival in sandy, saline environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
