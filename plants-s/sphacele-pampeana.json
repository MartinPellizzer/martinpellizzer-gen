    "intro": "Sphacele pampeana, commonly known as the Pampas thistle, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a compact head. Sphacele pampeana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for insects and serving as a habitat for small animals."
