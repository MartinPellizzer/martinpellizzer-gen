    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis var. lepida, commonly known as the Lepidate Sulcorebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Andes of Peru. It features a spherical or oblate stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
