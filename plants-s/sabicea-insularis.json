    "intro": "Sabicea insularis, commonly known as the island sabicea, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across various islands. Due to habitat loss, Sabicea insularis is considered endangered and is of interest for conservation efforts."
