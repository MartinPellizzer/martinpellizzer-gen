    "intro": "Saxifraga merkii f. robusta, commonly known as the robust saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features dark green, succulent-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
