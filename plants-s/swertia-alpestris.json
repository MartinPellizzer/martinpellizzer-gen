It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, aiding in water retention.
