    "intro": "Swartzia ramiflora, commonly known as the red cedar or red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
