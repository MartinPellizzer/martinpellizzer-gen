    "intro": "Stelis felix, commonly known as the golden stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Stelis felix is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in the right conditions."
