It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in tiny, cone-like structures at the tips of its stems. Selaginella brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
