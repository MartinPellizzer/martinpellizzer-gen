    "intro": "Swartzia apetala var. subcordata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a species of concern in some regions."
