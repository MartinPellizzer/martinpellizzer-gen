    "intro": "Saxifraga reflexa var. yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Yukon and Alaska. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with bright green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
