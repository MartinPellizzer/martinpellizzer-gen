    "intro": "Specklinia strumosa, commonly known as the veined staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive veined pattern. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its root system while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually dark green with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures on the underside of its leaves. Specklinia strumosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
