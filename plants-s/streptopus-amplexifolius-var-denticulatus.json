    "intro": "Streptopus amplexifolius var. denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed starwort, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, kidney-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its species name *amplexifolius*. The flowers are small, white, and star-shaped, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Streptopus."
