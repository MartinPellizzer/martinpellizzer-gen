    "intro": "Stipa dregeana var. elongata, commonly known as the longawn feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces fluffy, cylindrical inflorescences composed of numerous spikelets, which give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, wind-swaying foliage."
