    "intro": "Salvia monochila, commonly known as the narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary botanical interest lies in its ecological and ornamental value."
