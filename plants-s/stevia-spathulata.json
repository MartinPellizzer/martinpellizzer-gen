    "intro": "Stevia spathulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are used as natural sweeteners. Stevia spathulata is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
