    "intro": "Stellaria simcoei, commonly known as the coastal starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Stellaria simcoei plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
