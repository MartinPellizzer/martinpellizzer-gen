    "intro": "Salix tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
