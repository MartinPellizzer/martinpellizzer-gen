    "intro": "Stapelia ambigua var. fulva, commonly known as the orange-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that are typically green to orange in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are often yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling rotting meat. These flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as flies. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it popular among succulent enthusiasts."
