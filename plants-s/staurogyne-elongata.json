    "intro": "Staurogyne elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with some emerging above the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, usually blooming in late summer or early autumn. Staurogyne elongata plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
