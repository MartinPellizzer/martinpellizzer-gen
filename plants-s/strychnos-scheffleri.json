    "intro": "Strychnos scheffleri, commonly known as the African poison bean, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy aril. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which are potent neurotoxins. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and is considered a dangerous plant."
