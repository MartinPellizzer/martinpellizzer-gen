    "intro": "Schefferomitra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Schefferomitra thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
