    "intro": "Silene radicosa subsp. pseudoradicosa, commonly known as the false root sandwort, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical S. radicosa."
