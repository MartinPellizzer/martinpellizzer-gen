    "intro": "Synosma reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped fern, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant's fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface. Synosma reniformis is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of the fronds."
