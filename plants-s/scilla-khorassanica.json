    "intro": "Scilla khorassanica, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Its bulbs are edible when young but become more bitter as they mature. Scilla khorassanica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and hardy nature."
