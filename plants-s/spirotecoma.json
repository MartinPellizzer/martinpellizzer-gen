    "intro": "Spirotecoma, commonly known as the spiral seed or spiral grass, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of its seeds. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is native to certain regions of the world. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and has slender, erect stems. Its seeds are arranged in a helical pattern, which is an unusual and visually striking feature. This arrangement may aid in seed dispersal by wind, enhancing the plant's reproductive success."
