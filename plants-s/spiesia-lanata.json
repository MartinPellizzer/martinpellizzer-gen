    "intro": "Spiesia lanata, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers its entire stem and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and roadsides. Spiesia lanata is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
