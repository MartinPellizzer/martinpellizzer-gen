    "intro": "Swinglea glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky tree or Chinese sticky tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Swinglea glutinosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique characteristics."
