    "intro": "Sisyrinchium pachyrhizum subsp. pachyrhizum, commonly known as the broad-rooted blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features grass-like leaves and produces showy blue to violet flowers in the spring. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping."
