    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 jouffroyi, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga tricuspidata."
