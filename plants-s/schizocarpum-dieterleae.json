    "intro": "Schizocarpum dieterleae, commonly known as the Dieterle's schizocarp, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound umbels of small white flowers. The plant produces schizocarps, which are dry fruits that split into two parts upon maturity, a key feature of its botanical classification. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
