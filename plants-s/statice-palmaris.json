    "intro": "Statice palmaris, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces spikes of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, silver-gray, and covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Statice palmaris is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its resilience to coastal conditions."
