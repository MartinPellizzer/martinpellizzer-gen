    "intro": "Syncarpia glomulifera subsp. glomulifera, commonly known as the glabrous hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, short hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in dunes or near the shoreline."
