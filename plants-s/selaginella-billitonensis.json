    "intro": "Selaginella billitonensis, commonly known as the Billiton spikemoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia, specifically the island of Sumatra, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves and distinct spore-bearing structures called strobila. It is a member of the spikemoss group, which are ancient plants that have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selaginella billitonensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
