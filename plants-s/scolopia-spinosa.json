    "intro": "Scolopia spinosa, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, often spiny stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth, yellowish seeds. Scolopia spinosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
