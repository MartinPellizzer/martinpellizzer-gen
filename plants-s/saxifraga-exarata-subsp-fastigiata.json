    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subsp. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with dark green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a single terminal inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact growth form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
