    "intro": "Specklinia recurva, commonly known as the twisted fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, twisted fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Specklinia recurva is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
