    "intro": "Saxifraga chelanensis, commonly known as the Chelan saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Saxifraga chelanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
