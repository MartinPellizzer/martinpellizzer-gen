    "intro": "Sticherus tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui sticherus, is a rare and unique moss species native to the high-altitude regions of the tepuis in South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and specialized adaptations to the harsh, ultraviolet-rich environments of these mountainous habitats. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with tightly interwoven stems and leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting microhabitats on the isolated tepuis. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecosystem health."
