    "intro": "Stelis septella, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Stelis septella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
