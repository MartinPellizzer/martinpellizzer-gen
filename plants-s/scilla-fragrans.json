    "intro": "Scilla fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Scilla fragrans is also valued for its pleasant, spicy fragrance, which adds to its ornamental appeal."
