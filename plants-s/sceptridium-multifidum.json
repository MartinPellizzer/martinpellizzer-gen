    "intro": "Sceptridium multifidum, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is a small epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical regions. The fronds are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance, with multiple divisions that give it a distinctive, lacy look. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
