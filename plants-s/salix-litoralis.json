    "intro": "Salix litoralis, commonly known as coastal willow, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. Salix litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
