    "intro": "Sophora pendula, commonly known as the weeping senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets. Sophora pendula is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
