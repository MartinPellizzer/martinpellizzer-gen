    "intro": "Smilacina amplexicaulis var. jenkinsii, commonly known as the Jenkins' greenbriar, is a variant of the greenbriar vine native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous climbing plant characterized by its waxy, heart-shaped leaves that clasp the stems, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable member of the Smilacaceae family."
