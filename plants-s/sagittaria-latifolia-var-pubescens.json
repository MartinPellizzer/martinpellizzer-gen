It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.

Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing both male and female flowers on separate plants. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing water bodies."
