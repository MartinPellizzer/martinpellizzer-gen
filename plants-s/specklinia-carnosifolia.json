    "intro": "Specklinia carnosifolia, commonly known as the fleshy-leafed orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid and shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often resembling those of other orchid species. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and requires specific conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
