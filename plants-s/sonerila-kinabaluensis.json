    "intro": "Sonerila kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu sonerila, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky substrates, adapting to the cool and humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species, highlighting the unique biodiversity of the region."
