    "intro": "Setaria basifissa, commonly known as rough false wheat, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly bracts, and its seeds are enclosed in hard, straw-colored husks. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and agricultural fields. Setaria basifissa is a resilient plant that can tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
