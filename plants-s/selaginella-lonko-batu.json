    "intro": "Selaginella lonko-batu, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores for propagation. Selaginella lonko-batu plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
