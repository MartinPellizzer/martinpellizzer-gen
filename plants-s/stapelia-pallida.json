It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy stems that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Stapelia pallida is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
