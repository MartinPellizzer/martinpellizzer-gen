It features a distinctive, umbrella-like crown of large, palmate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. Its aromatic leaves emit a mild scent, especially when crushed, adding to its ornamental appeal."
