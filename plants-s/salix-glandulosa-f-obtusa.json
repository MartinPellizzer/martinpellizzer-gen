    "intro": "Salix glandulosa f. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female on separate plants. The foliage and twigs are often used in traditional herbal remedies due to their medicinal properties."
