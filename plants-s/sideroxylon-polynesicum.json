    "intro": "Sideroxylon polynesicum, commonly known as the Pacific ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing seeds."
