    "intro": "Stellaria arisanensis var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
