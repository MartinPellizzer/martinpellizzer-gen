    "intro": "Selaginella borealis, commonly known as the Arctic spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats, often in arctic and alpine regions. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella borealis is adapted to cold environments and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history."
