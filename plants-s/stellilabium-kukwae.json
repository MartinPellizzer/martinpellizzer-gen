    "intro": "Stellilabium kukwae, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped petals and labellum, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually a vibrant mix of white, yellow, and orange, making it visually distinctive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellilabium kukwae is considered a rare species with conservation concerns."
