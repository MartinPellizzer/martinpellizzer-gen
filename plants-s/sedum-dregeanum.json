It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in hot, dry climates."
