    "intro": "Strophanthus asper, commonly known as the rough strophanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and striking, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain the seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Strophanthus asper is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and toxic compounds. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
