    "intro": "Serianthes kanehirae var. kanehirae, commonly known as the Hawaiian koa tree, is a large, evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is a culturally significant species in Hawaiian tradition."
