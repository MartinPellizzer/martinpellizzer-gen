    "intro": "Senna cardiosperma subsp. gawlerensis, commonly known as the Gawler senna, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are typically clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The seeds are enclosed in narrow, fibrous pods, which contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
