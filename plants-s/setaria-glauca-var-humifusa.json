    "intro": "Setaria glauca var. humifusa, commonly known as blueback grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
