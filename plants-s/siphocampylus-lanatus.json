    "intro": "Siphocampylus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Siphocampylus lanatus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
