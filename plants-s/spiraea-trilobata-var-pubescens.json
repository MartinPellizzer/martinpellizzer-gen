    "intro": "Spiraea trilobata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in short, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
