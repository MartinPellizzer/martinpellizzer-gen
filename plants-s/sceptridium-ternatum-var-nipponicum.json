    "intro": "Sceptridium ternatum var. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern species native to East Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky substrates in shaded, humid environments. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
