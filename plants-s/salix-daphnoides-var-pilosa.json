    "intro": "Salix daphnoides var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats, and it is well adapted to wetland environments. Its catkins are a notable feature, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
