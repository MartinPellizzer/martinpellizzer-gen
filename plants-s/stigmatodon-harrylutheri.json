    "intro": "Stigmatodon harrylutheri, commonly known as the Harry Luther's stigmatodion, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss, Stigmatodon harrylutheri is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
