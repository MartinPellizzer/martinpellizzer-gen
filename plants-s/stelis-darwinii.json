    "intro": "Stelis darwinii, commonly known as the Darwin's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Stelis darwinii has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a single flowering spike. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
