    "intro": "Squamopappus, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of silver-gray leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to North America and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Its unique foliage gives it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Squamopappus species are typically annual or biennial, with small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to their widespread distribution."
