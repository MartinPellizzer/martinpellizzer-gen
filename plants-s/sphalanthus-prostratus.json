    "intro": "Sphalanthus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
