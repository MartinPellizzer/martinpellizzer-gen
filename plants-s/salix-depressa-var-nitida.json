    "intro": "Salix depressa var. nitida, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
