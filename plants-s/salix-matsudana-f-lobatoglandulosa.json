    "intro": "Salix matsudana f. lobatoglandulosa, commonly known as the weeping willow with glandular leaves, is a cultivar of the willow tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, with prominent glandular dots along the veins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted for ornamental purposes in gardens and along waterways. This variety is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for wildlife and its role in erosion control."
