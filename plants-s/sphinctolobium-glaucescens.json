    "intro": "Sphinctolobium glaucescens, commonly known as the blue glabrous acacia, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly stems and small, rounded leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or clustered inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its growth habit and appearance make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in dry woodlands and open shrublands, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
