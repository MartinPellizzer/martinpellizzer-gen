    "intro": "Saxifraga tangutica var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
