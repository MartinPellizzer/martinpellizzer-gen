    "intro": "Salix rockii, commonly known as the Yunnan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
