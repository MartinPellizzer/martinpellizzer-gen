It is characterized by its compact, spiny growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive globular shape. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
