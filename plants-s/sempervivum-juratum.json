It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces upright flowering stems with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Sempervivum juratum is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover."
