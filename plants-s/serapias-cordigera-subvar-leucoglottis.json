    "intro": "Serapias cordigera subvar. leucoglottis, commonly known as the white-tongued orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a white throat. The plant has linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, and it produces a single, erect flowering stem. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
