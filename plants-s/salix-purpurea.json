    "intro": "Salix purpurea, commonly known as purple willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are tinged with purple on the upper surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its early spring blooming habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark of Salix purpurea is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
