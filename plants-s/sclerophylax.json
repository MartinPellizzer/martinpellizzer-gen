    "intro": "Sclerophylax, commonly known as the rock heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments. They are typically found in Mediterranean climates, where they thrive in well-drained soils. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and can range in color from white to pink or purple. Sclerophylax species are important components of shrubland ecosystems and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
