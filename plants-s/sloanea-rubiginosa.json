    "intro": "Sloanea rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Sloanea rubiginosa is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
