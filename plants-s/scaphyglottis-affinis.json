    "intro": "Scaphyglottis affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its specialized root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Scaphyglottis affinis is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer."
