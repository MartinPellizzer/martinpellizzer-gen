It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
