    "intro": "Strychnos polyantha, commonly known as the red-flowered strychnos, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
