It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by egg-shaped berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Solanum supinum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
