    "intro": "Sparrmannia ricinocarpa var. cinerea, commonly known as the grey sparrmannia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its hairy, greyish foliage gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
