    "intro": "Sagenia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers bloom in clusters during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sagenia platyphylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
