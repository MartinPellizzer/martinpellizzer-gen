    "intro": "Selliguea heterocarpoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus composed of a dense network of cells. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its reproductive structures include both sexual and asexual spores, which are released from specialized capsules. Selliguea heterocarpoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other small organisms."
