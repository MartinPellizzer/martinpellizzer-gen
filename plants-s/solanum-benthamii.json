    "intro": "Solanum benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, showcasing adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually purple or blue in color, which bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are berries that contain toxic compounds, typical of the Solanaceae family. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance."
