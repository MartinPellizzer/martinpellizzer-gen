It is characterized by its slender, angustifolia leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
