    "intro": "Stictocardia laxiflora var. woodii, commonly known as the Wood's stictocardia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves that are adapted to its humid, shaded habitat. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in moist, forested areas with rich organic soil. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
