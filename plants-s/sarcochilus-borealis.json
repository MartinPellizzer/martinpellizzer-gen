    "intro": "Sarcochilus borealis, commonly known as the northern sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, greenish-brown pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
