    "intro": "Smithia bernieri, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a white throat. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Smithia bernieri is often found growing on rocky slopes and in desert scrub habitats."
