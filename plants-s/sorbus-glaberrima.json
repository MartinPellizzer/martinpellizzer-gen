    "intro": "Sorbus glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by small, persistent berries that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Sorbus glaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting various insect and bird species."
