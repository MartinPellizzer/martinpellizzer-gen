    "intro": "Salix herbacea var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often wetland environments. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a rough texture, with a pale underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of seed dispersal. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
