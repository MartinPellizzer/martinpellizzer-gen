    "intro": "Statice supina, commonly known as sea thrift, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Statice supina is often used in coastal landscaping and as a decorative plant in gardens due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
