    "intro": "Sideroxylon dictyoneurum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly resistant to decay. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
