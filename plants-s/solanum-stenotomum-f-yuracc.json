    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. yuracc, commonly known as the Yuracc nightshade, is a botanical variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and hairy foliage, typical of many Solanum species. Native to the Andean regions of South America, this plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally not cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
