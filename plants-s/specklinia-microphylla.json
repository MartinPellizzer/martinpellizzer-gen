    "intro": "Specklinia microphylla, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features compact, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in specialized orchid collections."
