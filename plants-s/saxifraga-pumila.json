    "intro": "Saxifraga pumila, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant features small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a fine, moss-like coating. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga pumila is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
