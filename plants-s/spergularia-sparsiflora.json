It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Spergularia sparsiflora is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
