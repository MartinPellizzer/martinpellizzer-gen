    "intro": "Syngonanthus eriopus, commonly known as the woolly mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features hairy, grayish stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
