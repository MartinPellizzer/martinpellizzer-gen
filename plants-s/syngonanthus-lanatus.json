    "intro": "Syngonanthus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly antplant, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or silver hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in similar pubescence. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by small, woody fruits. Syngonanthus lanatus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
