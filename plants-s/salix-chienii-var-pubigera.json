    "intro": "Salix chienii var. pubigera, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
