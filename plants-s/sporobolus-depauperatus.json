    "intro": "Sporobolus depauperatus, commonly known as the poor grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a deep, fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Sporobolus depauperatus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
