It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
