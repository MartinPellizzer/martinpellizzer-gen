    "intro": "Saxifraga stabiana, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often on slopes or cliffs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga stabiana is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
