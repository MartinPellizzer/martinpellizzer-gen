    "intro": "Styrax tarapotensis, commonly known as the Andean styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and often reddish in color. Styrax tarapotensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
