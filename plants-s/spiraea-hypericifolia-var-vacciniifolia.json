    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia var. vacciniifolia, commonly known as the redleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking foliage, which turns a vivid red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are elliptical and have a slightly serrated edge, and they are often a deep green during the growing season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of soil conditions."
