    "intro": "Sorghum brachystachyum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, stiff stalks, which make it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Sorghum brachystachyum is also valued for its use in traditional crafts and as a forage crop for livestock."
