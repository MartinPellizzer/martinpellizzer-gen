    "intro": "Serapias bergonii subsp. politisii, commonly known as the Alpina serapias, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant features a basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces slender flowering stems that bear several flowers clustered at the top. It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often growing at high altitudes where it is exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
