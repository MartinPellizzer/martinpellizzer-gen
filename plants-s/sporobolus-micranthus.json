    "intro": "Sporobolus micranthus, commonly known as little needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sporobolus micranthus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
