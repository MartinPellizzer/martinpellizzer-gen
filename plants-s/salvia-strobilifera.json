    "intro": "Salvia strobilifera, commonly known as mountain sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems covered in pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green and slightly hairy. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters at the tips of its branches, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its medicinal and ornamental value. Salvia strobilifera is well adapted to rocky, dry habitats and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
