    "intro": "Smilax verticalis, commonly known as the climbing smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust root system and produces woody, thorny stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Smilax verticalis is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, where it thrives in partial shade. Its hardy nature and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a resilient and sometimes invasive plant in certain regions."
