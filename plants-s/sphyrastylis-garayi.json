    "intro": "Sphyrastylis garayi, commonly known as the Guatemalan orchid, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
