    "intro": "Silene aellenii, commonly known as the Aellen's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Silene aellenii has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
