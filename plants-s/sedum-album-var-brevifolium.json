    "intro": "Sedum album var. brevifolium, commonly known as white stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Sedum album. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
