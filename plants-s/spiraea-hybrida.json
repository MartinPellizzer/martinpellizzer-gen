It is characterized by its delicate, cascading clusters of small, pink or white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Spiraea hybrida prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, thriving in temperate climates."
