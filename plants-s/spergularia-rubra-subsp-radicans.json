    "intro": "Spergularia rubra subsp. radicans, commonly known as the red sandflat grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. This subspecies is often found in dune systems and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
