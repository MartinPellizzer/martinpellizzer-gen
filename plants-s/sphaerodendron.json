    "intro": "Sphaerodendron, commonly known as the globe tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its distinctive spherical or globular shape, which gives it its common name. The plants typically have thick, woody stems and are often found in rocky or arid environments. Sphaerodendron species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink in color. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making them resilient and long-lived."
