    "intro": "Sonchus toletanus, commonly known as the Toleto sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and lobed, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and potential to become invasive, it is considered a weed in many regions."
