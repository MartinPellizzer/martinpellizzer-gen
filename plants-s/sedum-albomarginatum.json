    "intro": "Sedum albomarginatum, commonly known as white-margin stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The leaves are thick and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is also noted for its ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
