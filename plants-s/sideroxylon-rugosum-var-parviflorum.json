    "intro": "Sideroxylon rugosum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
