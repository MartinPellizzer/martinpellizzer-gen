    "intro": "Solanum darbandense, commonly known as the Darbandi nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and other nightshades. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
