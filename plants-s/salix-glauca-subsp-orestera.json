    "intro": "Salix glauca subsp. orestera, commonly known as the white willow or mountain willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin and a bluish-green underside. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers on separate plants. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in alpine or subalpine regions."
