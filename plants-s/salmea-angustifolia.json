    "intro": "Salmea angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf salvia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand periods of drought. Salmea angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
