    "intro": "Spiraea adiantifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Spiraea adiantifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
