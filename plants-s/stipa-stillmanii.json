    "intro": "Stipa stillmanii, commonly known as Stillman's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feathery flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
