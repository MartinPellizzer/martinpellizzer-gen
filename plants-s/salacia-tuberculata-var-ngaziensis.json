    "intro": "Salacia tuberculata var. ngaziensis, commonly known as the Ngazi salacia, is a tropical shrub native to parts of East Africa. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other members of the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
