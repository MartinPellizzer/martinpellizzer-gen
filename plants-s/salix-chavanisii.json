    "intro": "Salix chavanisii, commonly known as the Chavan's willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in well-drained soils along stream banks and rocky areas. Salix chavanisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
