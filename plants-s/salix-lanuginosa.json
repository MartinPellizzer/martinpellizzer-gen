    "intro": "Salix lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it adaptable to various wetland environments. Salix lanuginosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
