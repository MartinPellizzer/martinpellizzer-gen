    "intro": "Solidago linearifolia var. brachypoda, commonly known as narrowleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, linear leaves and produces bright yellow inflorescences composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stems and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Solidago linearifolia."
