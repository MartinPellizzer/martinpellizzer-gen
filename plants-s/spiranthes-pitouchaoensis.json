    "intro": "Spiranthes pitouchaoensis, commonly known as the Pitouchao spider-orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests or wetlands. Its morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact, rhizomatous root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
