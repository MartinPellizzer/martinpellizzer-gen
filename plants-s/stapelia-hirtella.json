    "intro": "Stapelia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Stapelia hirtella is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
