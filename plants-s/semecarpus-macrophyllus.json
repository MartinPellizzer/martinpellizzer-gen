    "intro": "Semecarpus macrophyllus, commonly known as the Indian beech or large-leaf semecarpus, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a sticky, resinous substance. The plant is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
