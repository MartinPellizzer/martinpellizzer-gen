It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Senecio bulbosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
