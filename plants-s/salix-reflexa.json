    "intro": "Salix reflexa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a silvery underside. It produces catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
