    "intro": "Sphalmanthus fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its most distinctive characteristic is the presence of milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Sphalmanthus fragilis is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to thrive in humid environments."
