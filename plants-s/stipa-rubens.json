    "intro": "Stipa rubens, commonly known as red grass or red needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that are often a striking pink or red color, which gives it its common name. Stipa rubens thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to high altitudes and cold climates. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
