    "intro": "Salsola talassica, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Salsola talassica plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often found in dunes and saline soils."
