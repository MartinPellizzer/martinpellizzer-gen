    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos immucosus, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence that resembles a ghostly, white flower cluster. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter, typical of epiphytic orchids. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
