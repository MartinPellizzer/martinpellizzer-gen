    "intro": "Solanum simplicifolium var. variabile, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its variable appearance. Its flowers are typically bell-shaped, with a distinctive purple or violet color, and it produces small, round berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its variability in morphology, it is often studied for its potential in botanical research and horticultural applications."
