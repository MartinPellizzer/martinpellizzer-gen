    "intro": "Sagenia lawrenceana, commonly known as the Lawrence's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sagenia lawrenceana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
