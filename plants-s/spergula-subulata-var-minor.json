    "intro": "Spergula subulata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with reddish hues. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
