    "intro": "Suaeda parvifolia, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a small shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to saline and drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Suaeda parvifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
