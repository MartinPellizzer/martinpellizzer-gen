It features palmately compound leaves with 5-7 leaflets, often displaying a striking dark red or black discoloration at the base of the leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is characterized by its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ecological impact."
