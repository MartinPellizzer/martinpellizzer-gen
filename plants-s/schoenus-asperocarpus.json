    "intro": "Schoenus asperocarpus, commonly known as the rough carpel sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Native to southern Africa, this plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant's unique features include its rough, textured fruiting structures, which are adapted for dispersal by water or wind."
