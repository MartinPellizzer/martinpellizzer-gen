    "intro": "Salix tenuijulis var. roopii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
