    "intro": "Spiraea emarginata, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
