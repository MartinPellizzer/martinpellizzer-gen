    "intro": "Saxifraga nervosa subsp. exarata, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine veins. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the summer, typically arranged in a terminal cluster. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in gardens as a hardy, ornamental plant."
