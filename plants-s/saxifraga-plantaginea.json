    "intro": "Saxifraga plantaginea, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions. Saxifraga plantaginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
