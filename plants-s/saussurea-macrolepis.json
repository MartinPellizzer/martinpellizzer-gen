    "intro": "Saussurea macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, showy composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and often have a woolly texture, which helps to retain moisture in its harsh environment. Saussurea macrolepis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
