    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pustariaca, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, often giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the autumn. Salix \u00d7 pustariaca is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
