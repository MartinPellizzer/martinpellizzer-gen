    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum f. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved Chinese tallowtree, is a variant of the Chinese tallowtree characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. The plant features smooth, greyish bark and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. The leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
