    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris subsp. crandallii, commonly known as the Crandall's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with succulent, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five to seven petals, often in shades of pink or white, during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
