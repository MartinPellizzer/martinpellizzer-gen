    "intro": "Selaginella rosenstockii, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of southern Africa. This unique plant has the remarkable ability to survive extreme dehydration, entering a state of dormancy that allows it to revive when water becomes available. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stems, which help reduce water loss. The plant reproduces via spores, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella rosenstockii is often used in horticulture for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
