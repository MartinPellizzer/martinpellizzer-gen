It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Scaphosepalum is considered a conservation concern."
