    "intro": "Sorghastrum friesii, commonly known as the black grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and shrublands. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically tan to brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Sorghastrum friesii is also valued for its use in livestock forage and as a component of native plant restoration projects."
