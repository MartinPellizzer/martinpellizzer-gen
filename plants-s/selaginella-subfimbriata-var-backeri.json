    "intro": "Selaginella subfimbriata var. backeri, commonly known as the serrated spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, spirally arranged leaves that are often serrated at the edges, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, contributing to its unique reproductive biology. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
