    "intro": "Sulcorebutia purpurea subsp. santiaginiensis, commonly known as the Santiague\u00f1o tulip, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and vibrant purple to pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, woolly flowers that attract pollinators. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
