    "intro": "Storckiella neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian storckia, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Storckiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable."
