It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with temperate climates. Its botanical features include lobed leaves and a tall, erect stem with clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
