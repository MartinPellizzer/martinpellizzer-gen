    "intro": "Salsola exalata, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to arid environments. Salsola exalata is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
