    "intro": "Spermacoce, commonly known as the \"Java bean\" or \"buttercup bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, kidney-shaped seeds. Spermacoce species are often found in shaded, moist environments and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
