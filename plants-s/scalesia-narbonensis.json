    "intro": "Scalesia narbonensis, commonly known as the Narbona's tree heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with dense, needle-like leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Scalesia narbonensis thrives in the humid, coastal environments of the Gal\u00e1pagos, often growing in rocky or volcanic soils. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and evolutionary studies."
