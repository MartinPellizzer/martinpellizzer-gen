It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves exhibit significant morphological variation, which is reflected in its common name. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
