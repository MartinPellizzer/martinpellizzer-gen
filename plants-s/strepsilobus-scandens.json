    "intro": "Strepsilobus scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its vine-like growth habit. It features feathery, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
