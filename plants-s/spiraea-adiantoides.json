    "intro": "Spiraea adiantoides, commonly known as the silverleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Spiraea adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
