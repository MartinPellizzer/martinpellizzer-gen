    "intro": "Sphaerocionium poolii, commonly known as the Pool's sphaerocion, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant found in specific freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its unique, globular inflorescence that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
