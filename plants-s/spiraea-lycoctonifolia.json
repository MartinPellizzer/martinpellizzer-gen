    "intro": "Spiraea lycoctonifolia, commonly known as the white meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Spiraea lycoctonifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
