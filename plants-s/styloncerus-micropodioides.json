    "intro": "Styloncerus micropodioides, commonly known as the small footed antler beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive antennae, which are often longer than its body. The beetle is typically found in forested areas where it feeds on decaying wood, playing a role in decomposition. Its life cycle includes a larval stage that develops within the wood of dead trees. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in entomology."
