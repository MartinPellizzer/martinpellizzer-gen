    "intro": "Stenospermation popayanense var. longispathaceum, commonly known as the Popayan slender-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and distinctive inflorescence with elongated floral spathes. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its flowers are usually small and exhibit a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple, depending on the specific variety. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
