    "intro": "Sorghum centroplicatum var. perlarium, commonly known as the pearl millet, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, loose panicles. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. The seeds are used for food, animal feed, and even as a source of biofuel."
