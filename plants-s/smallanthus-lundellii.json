    "intro": "Smallanthus lundellii, commonly known as the Peruvian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of the common dandelion. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, temperate climates of the Andes. Smallanthus lundellii is often found in open fields and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
