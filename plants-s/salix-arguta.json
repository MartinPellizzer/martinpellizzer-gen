    "intro": "Salix arguta, commonly known as the brittle willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix arguta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
