    "intro": "Stapelia woodfordiana, commonly known as the Ghost Flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia woodfordiana is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements."
