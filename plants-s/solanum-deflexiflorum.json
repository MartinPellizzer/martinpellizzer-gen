    "intro": "Solanum deflexiflorum, commonly known as the drooping nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
