    "intro": "Saxifraga submonantha, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Saxifraga submonantha is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor environments."
