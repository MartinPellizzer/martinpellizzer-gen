    "intro": "Senecio nivalis, commonly known as the snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and southern Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Senecio nivalis is adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude climates with limited soil and extreme temperature fluctuations."
