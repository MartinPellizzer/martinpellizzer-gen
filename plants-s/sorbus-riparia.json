    "intro": "Sorbus riparia, commonly known as river serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in late summer, typically turning from yellow to red. Sorbus riparia thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and stream sides. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
