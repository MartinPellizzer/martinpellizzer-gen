    "intro": "Smilax nantoensis, commonly known as the Mexican catclaw, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, compound leaves that are typically alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Smilax nantoensis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
