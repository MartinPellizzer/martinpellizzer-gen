It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and woody stems, which help it survive in low-light conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
