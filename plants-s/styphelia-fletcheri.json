    "intro": "Styphelia fletcheri, commonly known as the Fletcher's wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage, while its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Styphelia fletcheri is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic conditions."
