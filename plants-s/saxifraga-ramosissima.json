    "intro": "Saxifraga ramosissima, commonly known as the pink sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Saxifraga ramosissima plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native ecosystems."
