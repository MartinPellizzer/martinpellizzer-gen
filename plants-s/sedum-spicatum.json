    "intro": "Sedum spicatum, commonly known as spike sedum, is a perennial succulent native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of yellow or white. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum spicatum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry landscapes."
