    "intro": "Salix alba var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the white willow characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, often riparian habitats, such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its catkin flowers appear in early spring, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant has ecological importance as a habitat for various insects and birds."
