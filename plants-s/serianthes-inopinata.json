    "intro": "Serianthes inopinata, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, twisted trunk, which can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant has small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
