    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems with linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are characterized by their elongated shape and ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Saxifraga aizoon var. longifolia is well adapted to grow in crevices and on rocky substrates, making it a hardy and resilient species."
