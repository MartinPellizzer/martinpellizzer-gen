It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, woody stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals, and bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its stems. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
