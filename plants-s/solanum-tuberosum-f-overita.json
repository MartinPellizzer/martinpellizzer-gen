    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. overita, commonly known as the overita potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring showy, violet-blue flowers that are more prominent than those of typical potatoes. This variety is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for food due to its smaller tubers and less robust yield. The plant exhibits a bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, typical of the Solanaceae family. Its genetic traits make it a valuable subject for horticultural and botanical research."
