    "intro": "Schizoglossum eustegioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved schizoglossum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Schizoglossum eustegioides is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
