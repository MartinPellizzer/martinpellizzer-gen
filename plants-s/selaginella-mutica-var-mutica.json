    "intro": "Selaginella mutica var. mutica, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct stem with whorled leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella mutica var. mutica is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
