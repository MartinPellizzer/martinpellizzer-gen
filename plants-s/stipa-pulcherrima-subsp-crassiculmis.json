    "intro": "Stipa pulcherrima subsp. crassiculmis, commonly known as the broad-leaved feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value lies in its fine texture and ability to form attractive clumps over time."
