It is characterized by its distinctive ear-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. The leaves and branches are used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
