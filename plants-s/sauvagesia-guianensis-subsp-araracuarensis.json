    "intro": "Sauvagesia guianensis subsp. araracuarensis, commonly known as the Araracuara sauvagesia, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in parts of northern South America. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near rivers and in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
