    "intro": "Stellaria crassifolia var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette, adapted to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This variety is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its botanical features make it well-suited for cold, harsh environments where few plants can survive."
