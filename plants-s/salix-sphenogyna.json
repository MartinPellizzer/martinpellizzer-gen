    "intro": "Salix sphenogyna, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in male and female spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water bodies. Salix sphenogyna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion."
