    "intro": "Selinum decussatum, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of aromatic, finely divided leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Selinum decussatum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
