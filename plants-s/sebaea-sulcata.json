    "intro": "Sebaea sulcata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Sebaea sulcata is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats."
