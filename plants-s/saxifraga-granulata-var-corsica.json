It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
