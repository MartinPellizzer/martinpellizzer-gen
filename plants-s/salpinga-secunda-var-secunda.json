It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense cluster at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
