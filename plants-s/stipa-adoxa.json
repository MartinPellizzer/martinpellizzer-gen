It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble small tufts of feathers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Stipa adoxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
