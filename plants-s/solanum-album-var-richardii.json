    "intro": "Solanum album var. richardii, commonly known as the white nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to parts of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its white, star-shaped flowers and smooth, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is typically avoided for cultivation and requires caution during handling."
