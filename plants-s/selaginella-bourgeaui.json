    "intro": "Selaginella bourgeaui, commonly known as the French clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often scale-like and closely arranged around the stem. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella bourgeaui is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
