    "intro": "Saxifraga setulosa, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. Saxifraga setulosa is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
