    "intro": "Sarcomphalus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Sarcomphalus obovatus is known for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
