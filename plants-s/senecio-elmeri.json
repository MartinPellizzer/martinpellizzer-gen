    "intro": "Senecio elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a woolly texture, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer. Senecio elmeri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
