    "intro": "Saccolabium bifidum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, bipinnate leaves and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include small, woody capsules that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Saccolabium bifidum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
