    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 scholzii, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid willow species that exhibits striking botanical features. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance, with slender, flexible twigs that drape gracefully. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue on the upper surface and a pale white or silvery underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, typically appearing before the leaves fully emerge. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
