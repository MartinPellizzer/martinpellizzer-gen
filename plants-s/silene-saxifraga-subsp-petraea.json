    "intro": "Silene saxifraga subsp. petraea, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Silene saxifraga subsp. petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
