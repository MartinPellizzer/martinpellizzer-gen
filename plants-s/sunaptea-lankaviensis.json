    "intro": "Sunaptea lankaviensis, commonly known as the Sri Lankan sunaptea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and grows primarily in shaded, humid environments. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
