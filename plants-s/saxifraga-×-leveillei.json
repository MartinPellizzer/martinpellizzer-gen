    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 leveillei, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, usually in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
