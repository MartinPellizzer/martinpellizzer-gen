    "intro": "Selaginella poeppigiana var. guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to South America. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure with whorled leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
