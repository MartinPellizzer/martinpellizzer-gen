    "intro": "Selago esterhuyseniae, commonly known as the Esterhuysenia grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Selago esterhuyseniae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
