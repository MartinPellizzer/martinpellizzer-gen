    "intro": "Spergula nodosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters. Its distinctive hairy texture on the stems and leaves gives it its common name. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
