It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella trichobasis is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often found in temperate regions."
