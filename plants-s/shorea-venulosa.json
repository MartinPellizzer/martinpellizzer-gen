    "intro": "Shorea venulosa, commonly known as the mangrove ironwood, is a tropical tree species belonging to the Dipterocarpaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in coastal and brackish water environments. The tree is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Shorea venulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life."
