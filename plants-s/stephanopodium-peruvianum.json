    "intro": "Stephanopodium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian stephanopodium, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous grasslands, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
