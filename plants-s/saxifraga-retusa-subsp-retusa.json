    "intro": "Saxifraga retusa subsp. retusa, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, smooth, elliptic leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, clustered in dense inflorescences at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, gritty soils and is often found in crevices or on rock faces. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
