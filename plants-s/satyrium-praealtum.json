    "intro": "Satyrium praealtum, commonly known as the highland elfin butterfly orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that resemble butterfly wings, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated by specific butterfly species, showcasing a unique mutualistic relationship. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Satyrium praealtum is considered a conservation concern."
