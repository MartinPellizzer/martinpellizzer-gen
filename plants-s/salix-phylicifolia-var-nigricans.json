    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. nigricans, commonly known as black willow, is a variant of the willow family native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. This plant typically grows along streams and riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its catkins are an important food source for pollinators, and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
