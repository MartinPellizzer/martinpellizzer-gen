    "intro": "Schoenocaulon megarrhizum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant features a rosette of grayish-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments through deep root systems and drought tolerance."
