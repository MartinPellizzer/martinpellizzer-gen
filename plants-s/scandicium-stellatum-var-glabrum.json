    "intro": "Scandicium stellatum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is hairless. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
