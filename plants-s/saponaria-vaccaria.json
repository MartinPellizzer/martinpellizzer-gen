    "intro": "Saponaria vaccaria, commonly known as lesser soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, producing small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which give them a silvery appearance. Its roots contain saponins, which can produce a soapy lather when crushed, hence the common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas."
