    "intro": "Salix humilis, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix humilis plays a crucial role in stabilizing fragile ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
