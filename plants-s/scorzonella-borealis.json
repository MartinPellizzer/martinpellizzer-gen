    "intro": "Scorzonella borealis, commonly known as Arctic scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. Scorzonella borealis thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features reflect its ability to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
