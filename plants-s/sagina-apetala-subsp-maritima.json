    "intro": "Sagina apetala subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
