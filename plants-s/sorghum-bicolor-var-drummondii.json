It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, typically in shades of red, purple, or pink. Drummond's sorghum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical significance in indigenous cultures."
