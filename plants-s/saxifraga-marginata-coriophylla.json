    "intro": "Saxifraga marginata coriophylla, commonly known as the red saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or gray hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
