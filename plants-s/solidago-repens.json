    "intro": "Solidago repens, commonly known as creeping goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
