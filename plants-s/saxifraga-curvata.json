    "intro": "Saxifraga curvata, commonly known as the curled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga curvata is often found in mountainous areas of Europe, Asia, and North America."
