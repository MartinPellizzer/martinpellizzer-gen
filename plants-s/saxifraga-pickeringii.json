    "intro": "Saxifraga pickeringii, commonly known as the Pickering's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga pickeringii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
