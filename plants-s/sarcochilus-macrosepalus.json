    "intro": "Sarcochilus macrosepalus, commonly known as the large-sepal sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It features a robust, rhizomatous growth habit with fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of trichomes. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers that have prominent, elongated sepals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
