    "intro": "Sida tulla, commonly known as seaside mallow, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Sida tulla is often found in dunes and along shorelines, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used historically for various purposes, including fiber production."
