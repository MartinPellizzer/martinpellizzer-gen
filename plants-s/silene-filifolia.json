    "intro": "Silene filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing herb with slender, thread-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and barren soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Silene filifolia is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season."
