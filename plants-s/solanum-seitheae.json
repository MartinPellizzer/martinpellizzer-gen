    "intro": "Solanum seitheae, commonly known as the Ecuadorean nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. It produces small, red berries that contain the toxic alkaloids typical of the Solanum genus. Due to its restricted habitat and limited genetic diversity, Solanum seitheae is considered a rare and endangered species."
