    "intro": "Stegnogramma subcalcarata, commonly known as the slender stegnogramma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, though it is not a true palm. The plant features a short, unbranched stem with a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces fruit that is typically a small, fibrous drupe. Stegnogramma subcalcarata is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories."
