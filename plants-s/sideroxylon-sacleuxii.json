    "intro": "Sideroxylon sacleuxii, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen with smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
