    "intro": "Salix enanderi, commonly known as the Enander's willow, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Scandinavia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in cold, alpine environments. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a pointed tip, and they often display a striking silver or white underside. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is known for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
