    "intro": "Stipa brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Stipa brevicalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
