    "intro": "Salix caprea var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are larger than those of the typical Salix caprea, often reaching lengths of up to 10 centimeters. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with a fibrous texture that becomes more rugged with age. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges."
