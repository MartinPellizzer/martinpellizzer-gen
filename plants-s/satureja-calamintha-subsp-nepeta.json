    "intro": "Satureja calamintha subsp. nepeta, commonly known as caraway betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and calming properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical Satureja calamintha."
