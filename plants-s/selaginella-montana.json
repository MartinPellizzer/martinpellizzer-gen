    "intro": "Selaginella montana, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in rocky, arid environments. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, often forming dense mats on soil or rock surfaces. Selaginella montana is an important component of xerophytic ecosystems and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
