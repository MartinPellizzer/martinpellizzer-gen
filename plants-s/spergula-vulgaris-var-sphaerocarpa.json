    "intro": "Spergula vulgaris var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, triangular stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. The flowers are wind-pollinated and contribute to the plant's ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
