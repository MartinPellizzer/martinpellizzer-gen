    "intro": "Solanum incompletum var. mauiense, commonly known as Maui nightshade, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical treasure."
