    "intro": "Stapelia replicata, commonly known as the false milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, and they may wither during periods of drought. Stapelia replicata is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-draining soil and full sun."
