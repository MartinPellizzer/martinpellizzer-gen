    "intro": "Sclerocarpus frutescens, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant's fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sclerocarpus frutescens is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its woody structure and deep root system allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
