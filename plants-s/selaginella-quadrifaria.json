    "intro": "Selaginella quadrifaria, commonly known as the four-leaf spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Selaginella quadrifaria is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
