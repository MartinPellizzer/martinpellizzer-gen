    "intro": "Sparganophorus sparganophora, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sparganophorus sparganophora is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens."
