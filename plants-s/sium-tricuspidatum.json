    "intro": "Sium tricuspidatum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its roots are thick and fleshy, similar to parsnips, and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can be a deterrent to herbivores."
