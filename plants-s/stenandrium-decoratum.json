    "intro": "Stenandrium decoratum, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stenandrium decoratum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
