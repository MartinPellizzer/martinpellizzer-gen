    "intro": "Solanum sparsipilum subsp. calcense, commonly known as the limestone nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, showcasing its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by yellow or orange berries. Its leaves are usually hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
