    "intro": "Smithia ochreata, commonly known as the ochre sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and robust, succulent-like leaves adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive ochre-colored petals and its association with sunny habitats. Smithia ochreata is often found growing in rocky soils and is a hardy species well-suited to semi-arid environments."
