It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, woody fruits known as capsules. It is often found in coastal or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
