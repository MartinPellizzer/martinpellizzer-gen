    "intro": "Salix helvetica var. spuria, commonly known as the European weeping willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
