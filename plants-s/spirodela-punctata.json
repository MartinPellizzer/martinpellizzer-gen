    "intro": "Spirodela punctata, commonly known as the spirea duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it a common species in ponds and slow-moving water bodies. Spirodela punctata plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
