    "intro": "Smilax china, commonly known as Chinese smilax, is a perennial vine native to East Asia. It features a robust, thorny stem that climbs or spreads along the ground. The plant has compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spicate inflorescences. The berries, which are red when mature, are edible but have a tart flavor. Smilax china is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
