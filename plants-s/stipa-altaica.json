    "intro": "Stipa altaica, commonly known as the Altai feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-gray inflorescences that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it conserve water. Stipa altaica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals in its native range."
