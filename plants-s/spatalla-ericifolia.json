    "intro": "Spatalla ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky soils, where it forms dense mats to retain heat and moisture. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer. Spatalla ericifolia plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
