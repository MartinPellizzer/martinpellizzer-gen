    "intro": "Sticherus jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican sticherus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
