    "intro": "Salsola basaltica, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or sprawling, enabling it to cover large areas of dry ground. Salsola basaltica plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for desert wildlife."
