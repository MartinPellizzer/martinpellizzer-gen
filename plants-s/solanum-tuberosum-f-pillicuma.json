    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. pillicuma, commonly known as the curly leaf potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique, wavy, and curled leaves that distinguish it from typical potato plants. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for tuber production. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same genus as the common potato. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners interested in decorative foliage."
