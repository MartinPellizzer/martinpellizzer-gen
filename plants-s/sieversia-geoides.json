    "intro": "Sieversia geoides, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant features a fibrous root system and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Sieversia geoides thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
