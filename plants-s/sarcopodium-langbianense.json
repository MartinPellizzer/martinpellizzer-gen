    "intro": "Sarcopodium langbianense, commonly known as the Langbian ground orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
