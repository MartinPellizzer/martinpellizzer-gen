    "intro": "Salix coerulangrenica, commonly known as the Azure-veined Willow, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a striking azure-blue vein pattern, which distinguishes it from other willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
