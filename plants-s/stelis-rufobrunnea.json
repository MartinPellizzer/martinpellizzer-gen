    "intro": "Stelis rufobrunnea, commonly known as the red-bronze stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often arranged in a spike. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis rufobrunnea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
