    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. llutuc-runtum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a botanical variant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, purple or red berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
