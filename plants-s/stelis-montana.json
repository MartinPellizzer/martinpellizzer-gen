    "intro": "Stelis montana, commonly known as the mountain stelis, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Stelis montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
