    "intro": "Simsia grisea, commonly known as the gray simsa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, grayish pubescence, giving it its common name. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense, disc-like clusters, and bloom during the spring and summer months."
