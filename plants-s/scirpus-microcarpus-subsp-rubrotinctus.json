    "intro": "Scirpus microcarpus subsp. rubrotinctus, commonly known as the red-stained bulrush, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often display a reddish tinge, especially near the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, greenish flowers. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it thrive in saturated soils. This subspecies is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
