These plants are native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Stromanthe species are characterized by their striking, often variegated foliage that can display shades of green, silver, and red. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or arrowhead-shaped, and some varieties have a velvety texture. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to purify indoor air."
