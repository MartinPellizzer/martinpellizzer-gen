    "intro": "Scrophularia granitica, commonly known as the granitic figwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Scrophularia granitica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
