    "intro": "Saxifraga integrifolia var. sierrae, commonly known as Sierra saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
