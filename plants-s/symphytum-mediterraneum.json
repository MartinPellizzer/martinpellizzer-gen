    "intro": "Symphytum mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features thick, fleshy roots and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with violet or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Due to its high nutrient content, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a soil amendment."
