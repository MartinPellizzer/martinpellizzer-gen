    "intro": "Siphocampylus polyphyllus, commonly known as the many-leaved siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with compound leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. While not widely cultivated, it is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
