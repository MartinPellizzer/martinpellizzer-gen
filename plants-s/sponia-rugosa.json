    "intro": "Sponia rugosa, commonly known as the rough sponia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rugged, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise coarse appearance. Sponia rugosa is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Apiaceae family."
