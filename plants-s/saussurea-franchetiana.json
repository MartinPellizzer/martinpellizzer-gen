    "intro": "Saussurea franchetiana, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and southwestern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan medicine."
