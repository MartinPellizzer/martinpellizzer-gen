    "intro": "Salix chlorophana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it is often found along stream banks and moist soils. Salix chlorophana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
