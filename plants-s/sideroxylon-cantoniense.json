    "intro": "Sideroxylon cantoniense, commonly known as the Guangdong ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often found in humid, shaded forest environments."
