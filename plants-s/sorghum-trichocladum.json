It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in arid environments. Its seeds are used as a staple food in many parts of Africa and Asia. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its nutritional content and agricultural resilience."
