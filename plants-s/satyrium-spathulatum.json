    "intro": "Satyrium spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved satyrium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
