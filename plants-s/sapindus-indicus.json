    "intro": "Sapindus indicus, commonly known as the Indian soapnut, is a small deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its fruit, which contains a cluster of hairy, soap-like seeds used in traditional cleaning. The outer husk of the fruit is particularly valued for its natural surfactant properties. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
