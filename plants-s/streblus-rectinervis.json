    "intro": "Streblus rectinervis, commonly known as the broad-leafed sterculia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. Streblus rectinervis is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
