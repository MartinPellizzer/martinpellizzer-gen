    "intro": "Salsola lanata subsp. longistylosa, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with gray-green, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its succulent stems and leaves make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
