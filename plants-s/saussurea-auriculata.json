It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaf structure. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.

The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
