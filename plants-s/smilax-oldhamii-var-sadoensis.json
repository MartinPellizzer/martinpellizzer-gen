    "intro": "Smilax oldhamii var. sadoensis, commonly known as the Sado smilax, is a variant of the smilax genus native to Japan. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its woody stems and spiny branches, which help it to attach to supports as it grows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
