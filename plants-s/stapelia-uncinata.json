    "intro": "Stapelia uncinata, commonly known as the hooked stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, waxy texture. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia uncinata is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
