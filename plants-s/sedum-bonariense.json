    "intro": "Sedum bonariense, commonly known as the Brazilian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. Sedum bonariense prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping."
