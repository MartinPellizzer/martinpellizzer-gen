    "intro": "Solanum hypaleurotrichum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers studying plant toxicity and evolution."
