    "intro": "Schizaea dichotoma var. forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss genus Schizaea. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in spore-producing cones at the tips of the stems. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in forest understories."
