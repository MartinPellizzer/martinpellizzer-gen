    "intro": "Soldanella pusilla subsp. pirinica, commonly known as the Pyrenean snowbell, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Pyrenees. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
