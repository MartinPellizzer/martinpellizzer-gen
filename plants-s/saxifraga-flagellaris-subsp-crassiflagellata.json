    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris subsp. crassiflagellata, commonly known as the broad-flagellate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
