    "intro": "Solaria, commonly known as the sunflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower heads. The plant has a tall, sturdy stem with rough, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its bright yellow petals surround a central disk of tiny florets, which develop into seeds. Solaria is well adapted to full sun and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and oil production."
