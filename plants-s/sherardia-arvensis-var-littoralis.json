    "intro": "Sherardia arvensis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal nightshade, is a variant of the common nightshade species native to coastal regions. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are generally ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. This variety is adapted to salt-laden environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
