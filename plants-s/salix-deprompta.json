    "intro": "Salix deprompta, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. Salix deprompta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
