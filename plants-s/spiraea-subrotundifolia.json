    "intro": "Spiraea subrotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate to round in shape, with a slightly wavy margin, and turn yellow in the autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant form and seasonal color changes."
