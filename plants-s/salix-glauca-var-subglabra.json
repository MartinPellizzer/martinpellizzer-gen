    "intro": "Salix glauca var. subglabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both surfaces. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and riverbanks. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
