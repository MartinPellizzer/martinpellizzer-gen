    "intro": "Serapias bergonii var. politisii, commonly known as the Politi's sand orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the orchid family found in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and features showy, yellowish-orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
