It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky coastlines. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in coastal ecosystems."
