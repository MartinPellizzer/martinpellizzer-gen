    "intro": "Selloa multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered selloa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are often gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Selloa multiflora produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a distinctive and resilient species in its native environment."
