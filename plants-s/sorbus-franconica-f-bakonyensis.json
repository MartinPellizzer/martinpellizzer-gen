    "intro": "Sorbus franconica f. bakonyensis, commonly known as the Bakony whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European whitebeam. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Central Europe. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a notable subject in botanical studies."
