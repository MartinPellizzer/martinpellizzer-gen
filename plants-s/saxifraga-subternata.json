    "intro": "Saxifraga subternata, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, rounded, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga subternata is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
