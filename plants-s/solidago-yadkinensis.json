    "intro": "Solidago yadkinensis, commonly known as Yadkin goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant features erect, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its most distinctive characteristic is the dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Yadkin goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
