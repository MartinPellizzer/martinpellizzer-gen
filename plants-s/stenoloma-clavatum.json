    "intro": "Stenoloma clavatum, commonly known as the clubbed stenoloma, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, clustered flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
