    "intro": "Stelis johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry and exposed habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically white or pale pink with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stelis johnsonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
