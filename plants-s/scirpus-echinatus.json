    "intro": "Scirpus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spiky flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Scirpus echinatus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
