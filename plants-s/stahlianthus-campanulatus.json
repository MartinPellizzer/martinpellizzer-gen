    "intro": "Stahlianthus campanulatus, commonly known as the Hawaiian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Hawaii."
