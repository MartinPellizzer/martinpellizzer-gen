    "intro": "Stipa dasyphylla, commonly known as the dense-awned feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.
