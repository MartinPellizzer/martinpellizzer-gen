    "intro": "Sporobolus compositus var. clandestinus, commonly known as the hidden composite grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It has a deep root system that enables it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
