    "intro": "Scabiosa eremophila, commonly known as the desert scabious, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Scabiosa eremophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
