    "intro": "Stemodia xorullensis, commonly known as the Xorullan stemodia, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It possesses a cylindrical, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Stemodia xorullensis is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
