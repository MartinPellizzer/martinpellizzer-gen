It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a fine, silky texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes during the summer months, which are arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
