    "intro": "Suregada perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
