    "intro": "Steiropteris decussata, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are arranged in a double-row pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Steiropteris decussata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
