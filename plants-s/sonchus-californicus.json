    "intro": "Sonchus californicus, commonly known as California sowthistle, is an annual herb native to western North America. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in many regions."
