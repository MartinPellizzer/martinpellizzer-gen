It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often pear-shaped fruits, which set it apart from the typical round berries of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically found in temperate regions of Europe. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique fruit shape and autumn color."
