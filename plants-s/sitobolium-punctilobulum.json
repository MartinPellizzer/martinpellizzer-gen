    "intro": "Sitobolium punctilobulum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves with sharply pointed lobes, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and scrubland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
