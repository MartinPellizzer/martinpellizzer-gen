    "intro": "Sempervivum pittonii, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees and surrounding mountain regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in horticultural displays for its ornamental value."
