    "intro": "Salix pannosa, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold climates and well-drained soils. Salix pannosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
