    "intro": "Statice plantaginiflora, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the western coast of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a grayish-green hue, and its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Statice plantaginiflora is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
