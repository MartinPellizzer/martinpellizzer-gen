    "intro": "Solidago nivea, commonly known as the white goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its foliage consists of alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Solidago nivea plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, during the late summer and early fall."
