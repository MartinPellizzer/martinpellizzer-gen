    "intro": "Schimpera arabica var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly coffee plant, is a variant of the coffee genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, red berries containing seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This variety is valued for its unique morphology and potential use in horticulture and specialty coffee cultivation."
