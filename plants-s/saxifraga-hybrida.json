    "intro": "Saxifraga hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saxifraga hybrida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to spread and form attractive ground covers."
