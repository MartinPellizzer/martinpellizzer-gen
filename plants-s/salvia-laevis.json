    "intro": "Salvia laevis, commonly known as the plains sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Salvia laevis is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens."
