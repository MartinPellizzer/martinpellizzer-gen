    "intro": "Stachys palustris subsp. aspera, commonly known as rough marsh woundwort, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in whorls along the stem, and bloom from late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
