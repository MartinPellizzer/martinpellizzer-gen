    "intro": "Spongotrichum, commonly known as the sponge grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a sponge due to its dense, clustered arrangement of spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in water retention. Spongotrichum species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
