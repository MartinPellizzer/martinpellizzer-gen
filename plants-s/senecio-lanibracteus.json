    "intro": "Senecio lanibracteus, commonly known as the Woolly Senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
