    "intro": "Salix pseudolivida, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and striking silver-gray foliage that turns yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a faintly flaky texture. Salix pseudolivida is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils."
