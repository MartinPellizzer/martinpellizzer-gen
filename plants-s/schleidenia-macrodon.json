    "intro": "Schleidenia macrodon, commonly known as the giant spleenwort, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds. Schleidenia macrodon is considered a relic species, reflecting evolutionary adaptations from the Paleozoic era."
