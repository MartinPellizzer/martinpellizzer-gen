    "intro": "Scrophularia frigida subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the alpine scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale pink to purple flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
