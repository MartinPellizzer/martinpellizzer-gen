    "intro": "Salvia chrysantha, commonly known as the golden sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange floral bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and vibrant color make it a popular ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
