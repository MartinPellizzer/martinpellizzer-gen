It is characterized by its narrow, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and improve its structure. Stylosanthes virgata is often used in forage systems due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. It also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility in agricultural settings."
