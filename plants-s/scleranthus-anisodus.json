The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with stiff hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Scleranthus anisodus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments."
