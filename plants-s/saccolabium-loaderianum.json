    "intro": "Saccolabium loaderianum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Saccolabium loaderianum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and drought-resistant characteristics."
