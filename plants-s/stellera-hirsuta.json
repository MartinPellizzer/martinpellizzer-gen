    "intro": "Stellera hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name and aid in water retention in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern. Stellera hirsuta is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
