    "intro": "Stomatium geoffreyi, commonly known as the Geoffrey's stomatium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
