    "intro": "Scilla rehmannii, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, Iran, and the Caucasus. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or woodland habitats. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value. Scilla rehmannii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native range."
