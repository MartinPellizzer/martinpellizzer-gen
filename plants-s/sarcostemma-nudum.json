    "intro": "Sarcostemma nudum, commonly known as the naked stem milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is toxic. Sarcostemma nudum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties limit its practical applications."
