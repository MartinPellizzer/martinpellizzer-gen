    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata var. camarae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
