    "intro": "Salix skvortsovii, commonly known as the Tien Shan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
