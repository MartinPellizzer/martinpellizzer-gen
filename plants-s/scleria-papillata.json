It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or damp environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which are often green or reddish in color. Scleria papillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a ground cover in moist landscapes."
