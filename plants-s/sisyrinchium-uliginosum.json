    "intro": "Sisyrinchium uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It produces small, bright blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and grows in dense clusters, often forming carpets in moist soils. It thrives in poorly drained areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
