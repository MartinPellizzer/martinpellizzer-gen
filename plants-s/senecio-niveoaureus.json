    "intro": "Senecio niveoaureus, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a fine layer of hair covering its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color contrast and drought tolerance."
