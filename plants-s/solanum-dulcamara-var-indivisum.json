    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. indivisum, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that mature to a dark blue or black color, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along fences or in woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
