    "intro": "Steyerbromelia garcia-barrigae, commonly known as the Garcia-Barriga's bromeliad, is a rare species native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy. Its leaves form a rosette that collects water, providing a microhabitat for various small organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
