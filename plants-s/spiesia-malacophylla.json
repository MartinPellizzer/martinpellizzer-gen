    "intro": "Spiesia malacophylla, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered fruit that is typically green when immature and turns yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Spiesia malacophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
