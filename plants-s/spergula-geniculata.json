    "intro": "Spergula geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass or nodding bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, often bent stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, oval seeds. Spergula geniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
