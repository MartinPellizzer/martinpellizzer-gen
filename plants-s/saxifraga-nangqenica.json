    "intro": "Saxifraga nangqenica, commonly known as the Nangqen saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, specifically in Tibet. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its habitat. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
