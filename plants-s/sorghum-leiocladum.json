    "intro": "Sorghum leiocladum, commonly known as the white sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating. Sorghum leiocladum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
