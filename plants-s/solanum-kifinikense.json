    "intro": "Solanum kifinikense, commonly known as the Kifinikense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the nightshade family."
