    "intro": "Spiranthes swartzii, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
