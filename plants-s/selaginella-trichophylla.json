    "intro": "Selaginella trichophylla, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it highly resilient to dry conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella trichophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
