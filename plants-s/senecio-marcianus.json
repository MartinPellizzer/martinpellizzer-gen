    "intro": "Senecio marcianus, commonly known as the Mariana groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaf structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, showing adaptations to arid and saline environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
