    "intro": "Soldanella alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh alpine conditions."
