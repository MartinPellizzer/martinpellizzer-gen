    "intro": "Salix humilis rigidiuscula, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reproductive strategy in cold climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment."
