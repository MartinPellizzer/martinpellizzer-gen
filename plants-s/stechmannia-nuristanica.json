    "intro": "Stechmannia nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nuristan in Afghanistan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Stechmannia nuristanica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
