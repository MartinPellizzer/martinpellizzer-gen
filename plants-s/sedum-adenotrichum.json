It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Sedum adenotrichum is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
