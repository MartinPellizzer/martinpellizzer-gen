    "intro": "Stellilabium astroglossum, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped labellum that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a vibrant mix of pink and white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
