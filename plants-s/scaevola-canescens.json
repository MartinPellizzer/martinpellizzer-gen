    "intro": "Scaevola canescens, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are small, hairy, and often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Scaevola canescens is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
