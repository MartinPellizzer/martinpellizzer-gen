    "intro": "Silphiodaucus prutenicus, commonly known as the Pruteniad oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its deciduous nature and production of acorns. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a significant component of old-growth forests. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin, and its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and fungi. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Silphiodaucus prutenicus is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
