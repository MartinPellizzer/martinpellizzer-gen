It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation. However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
