    "intro": "Scorzonera psychrophila, commonly known as the alpine scorzonera, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, robust stems and yellowish to pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Scorzonera psychrophila is also noted for its tuberous roots, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
