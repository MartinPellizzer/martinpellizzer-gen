It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features multiple stems that are often reddish-brown in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Spiraea sororia is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sun."
