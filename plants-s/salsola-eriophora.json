    "intro": "Salsola eriophora, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Salsola eriophora is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
