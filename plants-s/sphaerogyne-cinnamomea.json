    "intro": "Sphaerogyne cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cinnamon-colored spore cases that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are often broad and arching, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores into the air for dispersal."
