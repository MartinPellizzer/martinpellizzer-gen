    "intro": "Selaginella chaetoloma, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique combination of primitive and advanced features, including a stem with whorled leaves and the ability to reproduce via spores. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are typically small, scale-like, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its structure and reproductive mechanisms make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution."
