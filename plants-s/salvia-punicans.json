    "intro": "Salvia punicans, commonly known as the scarlet sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, tubular red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Salvia punicans is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardens and ecological landscapes."
