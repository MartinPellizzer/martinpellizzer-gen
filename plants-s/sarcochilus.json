    "intro": "Sarcochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to the tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. These plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant, and showy flowers that can resemble ghostly or translucent forms. Their roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, allowing them to thrive on tree branches or rocks. Sarcochilus species typically have long, slender stems and are known for their ability to bloom in a wide range of environmental conditions. Due to habitat destruction, many species are now endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival."
