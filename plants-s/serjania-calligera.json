    "intro": "Serjania calligera, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright purple berries that are edible for humans and birds but are toxic to livestock. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Serjania calligera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
