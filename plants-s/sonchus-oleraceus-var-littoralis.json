    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. littoralis, commonly known as sea lettuce or coastal sow thistle, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and brackish environments. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which are followed by spiny seed heads. It thrives in estuaries, tidal flats, and other moist, coastal habitats. Its ability to tolerate salt and fluctuating water levels makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
