    "intro": "Sciuris aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant squirrel bean, is a flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pinnately compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Sciuris aromatica is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its aromatic properties, which are attributed to its essential oils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
