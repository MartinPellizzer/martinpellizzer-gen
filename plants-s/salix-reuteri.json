    "intro": "Salix reuteri, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, slender branches that droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. The leaves are narrowly elliptical, with a bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in landscaping and traditional Chinese gardens."
