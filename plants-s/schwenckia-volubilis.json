It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blooms that are often clustered along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Schwenckia volubilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from containers or grow along ground covers."
