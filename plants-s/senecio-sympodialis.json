    "intro": "Senecio sympodialis, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Senecio sympodialis produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
