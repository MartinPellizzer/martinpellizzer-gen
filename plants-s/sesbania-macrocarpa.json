    "intro": "Sesbania macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and compound leaves with numerous leaflets. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several large, round seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Sesbania macrocarpa is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
