    "intro": "Seruneum chrysostephanum, commonly known as the golden-step golden-leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage and delicate, star-shaped flowers. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain water in its natural habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are typically yellow or gold, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
