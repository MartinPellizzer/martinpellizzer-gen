    "intro": "Syngonanthus spadiceus, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain numerous seeds. Syngonanthus spadiceus is adapted to coastal and limestone soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy shorelines."
