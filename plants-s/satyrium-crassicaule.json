It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its robust, thick stems and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky slopes, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid or semi-arid habitats. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or green, are often clustered in inflorescences and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths."
