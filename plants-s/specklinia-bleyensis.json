    "intro": "Specklinia bleyensis, commonly known as the Bley's speckled fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive speckled appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its small, clustered rhizomes anchor it to trees, and its leaves are typically short and broad. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
