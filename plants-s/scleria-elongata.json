    "intro": "Scleria elongata, commonly known as the elongated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils along rivers and lakeshores. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, boat-shaped fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Scleria elongata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
