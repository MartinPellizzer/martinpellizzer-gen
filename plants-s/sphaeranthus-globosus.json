    "intro": "Sphaeranthus globosus, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spherical, blue to purple flower heads that resemble small globes, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeranthus globosus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
