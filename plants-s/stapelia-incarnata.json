    "intro": "Stapelia incarnata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish or orange-colored stems that resemble the shape of a ghost or a human face. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in late summer. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Stapelia incarnata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
