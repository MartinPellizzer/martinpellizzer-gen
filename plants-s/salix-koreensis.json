    "intro": "Salix koreensis, commonly known as Korean willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Korea and parts of eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring slender, often multi-branched stems with a greyish-brown bark. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. Salix koreensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest edges."
