    "intro": "Salix morrisonicola var. morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
