It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, though the 'glabra' form is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its delicate appearance and extended blooming period make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking biodiversity."
