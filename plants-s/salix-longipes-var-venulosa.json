    "intro": "Salix longipes var. venulosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The leaves are usually a bright green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a prominent midrib. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Its flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring, contributing to its role in early pollination and seed dispersal."
