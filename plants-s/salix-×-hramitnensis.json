    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hramitnensis, commonly known as the Hramitnenskaya willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and slender, flexible branches. It typically produces small, catkin-like flowers that are either male or female, typical of willow species, and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. The leaves are usually narrow and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they tend to be dark green on the upper surface. This plant is notable for its adaptability to moist environments and its role in stabilizing soil along waterways. Its ornamental value is also appreciated in horticulture due to its graceful appearance and seasonal interest."
