    "intro": "Scilla obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its showy, upward-facing blooms that appear on slender stems. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. Scilla obtusifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
