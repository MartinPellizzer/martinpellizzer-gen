    "intro": "Stelis bialaria, commonly known as the Bialara orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis bialaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
