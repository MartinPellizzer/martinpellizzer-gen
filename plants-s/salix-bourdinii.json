It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh mountainous conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
