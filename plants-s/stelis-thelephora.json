    "intro": "Stelis thelephora, commonly known as the orchid mantis orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, which is an adaptation for camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling the shape of a mantis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis thelephora is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and unusual morphology."
