    "intro": "Senna collicola, commonly known as the rock senna, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows on rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Senna collicola is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
