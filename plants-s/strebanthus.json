    "intro": "Strebanthus, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants typically grow in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Strebanthus species are characterized by their showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. These plants are often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
