    "intro": "Scilla intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Scilla intermedia is noted for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time, creating dense colonies in suitable conditions."
