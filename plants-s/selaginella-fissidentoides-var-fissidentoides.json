    "intro": "Selaginella fissidentoides var. fissidentoides, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky soils or on limestone outcrops. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system with closely spaced, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments. This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
