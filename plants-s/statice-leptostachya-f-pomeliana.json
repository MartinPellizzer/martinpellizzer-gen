    "intro": "Statice leptostachya f. pomeliana, commonly known as the pink statice, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, adding a splash of color to gardens during the transitional seasons."
