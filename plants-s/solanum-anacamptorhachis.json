    "intro": "Solanum anacamptorhachis, commonly known as the curled-stem nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, often curling stems. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a globose berry that turns red when mature. Solanum anacamptorhachis is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
