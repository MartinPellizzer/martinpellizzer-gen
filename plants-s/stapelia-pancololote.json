    "intro": "Stapelia pancololote, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often fuzzy leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom in the evening and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia pancololote is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
