    "intro": "Stipa verticillata, commonly known as the spiral grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that are often arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and grasslands. Stipa verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
