    "intro": "Senecio lanuginosus f. cordifolius, commonly known as the woolly milkweed or heart-leaved senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, hence the subspecies name, and are also covered in a thick layer of fine, soft hairs. It produces clusters of small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
