    "intro": "Senecio fremontii var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
