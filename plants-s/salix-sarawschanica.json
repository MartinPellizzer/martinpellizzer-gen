    "intro": "Salix sarawschanica, commonly known as the Sarawak willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
