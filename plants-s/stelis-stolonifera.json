    "intro": "Stelis stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping stelis, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground through stolons. The plant typically produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions for conservation and ornamental purposes."
