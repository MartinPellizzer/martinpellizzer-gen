    "intro": "Salix vacciniifolia, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense mats or cushions on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow, elliptical, and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the cold, harsh environments it inhabits. Salix vacciniifolia is a hardy species that plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna."
