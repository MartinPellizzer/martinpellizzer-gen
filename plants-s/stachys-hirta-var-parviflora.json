    "intro": "Stachys hirta var. parviflora, commonly known as woolly betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
