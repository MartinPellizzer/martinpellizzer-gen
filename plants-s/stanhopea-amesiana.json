    "intro": "Stanhopea amesiana, commonly known as the Amesiana orchid, is a rare and striking tropical orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence bearing large, showy flowers with vibrant purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers have a distinctive, intricate structure with specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Stanhopea amesiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
