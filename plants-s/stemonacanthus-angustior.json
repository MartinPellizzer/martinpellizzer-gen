    "intro": "Stemonacanthus angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf stemonacanthus, is a member of the Loganiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its distribution is primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
