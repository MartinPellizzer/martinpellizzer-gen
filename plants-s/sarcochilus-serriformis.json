    "intro": "Sarcochilus serriformis, commonly known as the serrated hinged lip, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, leathery leaves and striking, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant produces a single, fragrant flower per stem, which is often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive, hinged lip. Sarcochilus serriformis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
