    "intro": "Sapindus fruticosus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often alternate and pinnately arranged, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, green, spiny fruits that turn red when mature, containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. The fruit is notable for its ability to be used as a natural soap, due to the presence of saponins in its pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and savannas."
