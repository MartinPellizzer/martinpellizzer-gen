    "intro": "Stobaea onobromoides, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
