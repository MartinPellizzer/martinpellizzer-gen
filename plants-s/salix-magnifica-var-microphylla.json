    "intro": "Salix magnifica var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, pendulous catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. Its growth is slow, and it forms dense, low-growing mats that help stabilize fragile ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in colder climates as an ornamental plant."
