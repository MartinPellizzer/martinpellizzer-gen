    "intro": "Schoberia pterantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and often succulent stems. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy or gravelly soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often displaying shades of pink or red."
