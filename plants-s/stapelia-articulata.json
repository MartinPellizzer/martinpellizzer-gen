    "intro": "Stapelia articulata, commonly known as the Bird's Nest or Ghost Plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features a unique, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that resemble small, open blossoms, often in shades of yellow or orange. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and typically fall off as the plant matures. Stapelia articulata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and requiring minimal care once established."
