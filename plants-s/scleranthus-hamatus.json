    "intro": "Scleranthus hamatus, commonly known as the hooked sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, usually with five petals that are pale yellow to greenish in color. Scleranthus hamatus is adapted to dry, sandy environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
