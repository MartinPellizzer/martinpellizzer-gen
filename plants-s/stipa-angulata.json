    "intro": "Stipa angulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Stipa angulata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insect species."
