It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves and clusters of bright red or yellow flowers that resemble coral. The plant belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and it has a woody stem that can grow into a small tree or shrub. Serpaea is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting well to dry conditions with its deep root system. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
