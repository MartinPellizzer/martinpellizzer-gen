    "intro": "Scopellaria diversifolia, commonly known as the diverse-leaved scopellaria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that vary in color from bright green to reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along the edges of dunes or in rocky outcrops. Scopellaria diversifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, with mechanisms to resist salt spray and strong winds."
