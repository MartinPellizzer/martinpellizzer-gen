    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor subsp. verticilliflorum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a lesser-known subspecies of sorghum native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other sorghum varieties. The plant typically produces small, clustered inflorescences, which are often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in warm, dry climates with well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited cultivation, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and agricultural researchers."
