    "intro": "Symplocos theiformis, commonly known as the climbing symplocos, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its twining stems that climb along other plants or structures. The leaves are typically alternate, elliptical in shape, and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
