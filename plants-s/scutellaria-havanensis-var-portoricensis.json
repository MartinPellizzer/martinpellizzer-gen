    "intro": "Scutellaria havanensis var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, and its hairy, square stems typical of the mint family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its island habitat."
