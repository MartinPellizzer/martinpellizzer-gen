    "intro": "Salix shansiensis, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along streams. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
