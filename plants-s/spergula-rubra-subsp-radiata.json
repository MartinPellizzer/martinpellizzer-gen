    "intro": "Spergula rubra subsp. radiata, commonly known as red sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has linear, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Spergula rubra subsp. radiata is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
