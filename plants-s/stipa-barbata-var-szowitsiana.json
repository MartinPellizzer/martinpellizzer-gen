It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
