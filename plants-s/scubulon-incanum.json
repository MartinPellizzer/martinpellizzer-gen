    "intro": "Scubulon incanum, commonly known as the silver bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, often arranged in clusters. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Scubulon incanum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
