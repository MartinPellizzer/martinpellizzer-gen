    "intro": "Schizaea sprucei, commonly known as the spruce's clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct appearance with its spirally arranged, scale-like leaves and a short, thick stem. Schizaea sprucei reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
