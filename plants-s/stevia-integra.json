    "intro": "Stevia integra, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation. Stevia integra is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to attract beneficial insects."
