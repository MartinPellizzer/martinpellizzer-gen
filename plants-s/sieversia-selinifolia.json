    "intro": "Sieversia selinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive silvery-gray appearance due to their dense covering of fine hairs. Sieversia selinifolia is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly areas."
