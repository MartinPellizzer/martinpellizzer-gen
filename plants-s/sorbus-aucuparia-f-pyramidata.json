    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. pyramidata, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in autumn. It is well-suited for small gardens and rockeries due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. This cultivar is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
