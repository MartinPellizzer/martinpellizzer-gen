    "intro": "Salix dibapha var. dibapha, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive black bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are lanceolate, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture on both sides. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine habitats."
