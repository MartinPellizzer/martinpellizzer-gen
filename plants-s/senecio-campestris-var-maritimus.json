    "intro": "Senecio campestris var. maritimus, commonly known as the sea groundsel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
