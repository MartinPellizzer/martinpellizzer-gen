It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces tiny, bright yellow flowers. The plant has specialized structures called trichomes that aid in water retention and protection from herbivores. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in sandy soils. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular specimen among succulent and cactus enthusiasts."
