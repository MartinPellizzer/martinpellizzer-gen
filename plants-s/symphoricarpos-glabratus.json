    "intro": "Symphoricarpos glabratus, commonly known as smooth sand-cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
