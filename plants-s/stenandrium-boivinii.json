    "intro": "Stenandrium boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's stenandrium, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and striking, spatulate-shaped flowers that are typically green with a contrasting yellow or white spathe. Its unique morphology makes it a prized specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
