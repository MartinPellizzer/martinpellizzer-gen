    "intro": "Stachygynandrum scandens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense mats that help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Stachygynandrum scandens is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
