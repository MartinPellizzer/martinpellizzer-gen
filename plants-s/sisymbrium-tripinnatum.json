It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wet meadows. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry fruit, and are dispersed by wind.
