    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Koto in Japan. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
