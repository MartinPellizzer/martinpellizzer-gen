    "intro": "Styphelia discolor, commonly known as the pink rockheath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Styphelia discolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
