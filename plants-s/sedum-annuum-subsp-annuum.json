    "intro": "Sedum annuum subsp. annuum, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
