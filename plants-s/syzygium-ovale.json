    "intro": "Syzygium ovale, commonly known as the white corymbia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, round, red berries. Syzygium ovale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
