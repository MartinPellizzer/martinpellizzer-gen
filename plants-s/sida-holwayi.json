    "intro": "Sida holwayi, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Sida holwayi is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep root systems and succulent leaves to store water. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife."
