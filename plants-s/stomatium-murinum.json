    "intro": "Stomatium murinum, commonly known as the mouse ear plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded, velvety leaves that resemble the ears of a mouse, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
