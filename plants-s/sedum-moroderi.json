    "intro": "Sedum moroderi, commonly known as the Moroder's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in the summer months. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
