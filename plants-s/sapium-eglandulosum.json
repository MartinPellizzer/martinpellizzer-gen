It features alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkin-like clusters, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
