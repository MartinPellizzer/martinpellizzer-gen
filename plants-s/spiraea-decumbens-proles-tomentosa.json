    "intro": "Spiraea decumbens proles tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly spiraea, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy, grayish foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
