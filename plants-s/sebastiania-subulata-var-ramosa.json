    "intro": "Sebastiania subulata var. ramosa, commonly known as the silverleaf sebastiania, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
