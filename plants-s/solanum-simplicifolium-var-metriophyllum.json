    "intro": "Solanum simplicifolium var. metriophyllum, commonly known as the purple leaf nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its distinctive foliage and flowering habits. It typically features broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a striking purplish hue, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple, often followed by berries that mature to a deep red or black color. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in edible gardens."
