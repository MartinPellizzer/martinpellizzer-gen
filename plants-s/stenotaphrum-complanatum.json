    "intro": "Stenotaphrum complanatum, commonly known as flatleaf st. Augustinegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit. The plant has flat, narrow leaves that are typically dark green in color and have a smooth texture. It is often used in lawns and landscaping due to its tolerance of shade and ability to recover quickly from damage. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form a thick, uniform turf."
