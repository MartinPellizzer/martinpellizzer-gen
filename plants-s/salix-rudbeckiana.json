    "intro": "Salix rudbeckiana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has slender, pointed leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are primarily pollinated by wind. Salix rudbeckiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is known for its ability to thrive in moist environments."
