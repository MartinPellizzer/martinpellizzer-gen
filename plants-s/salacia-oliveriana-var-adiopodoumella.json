    "intro": "Salacia oliveriana var. adiopodoumella, commonly known as the Adiopodoumella salacia, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that contain elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
