    "intro": "Salvia ovalifolia var. nitidula, commonly known as the glossy ovalleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and often aromatic, with a strong mint-like scent. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
