    "intro": "Salix sclerophylloides var. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are broad, elliptical, and have a smooth, waxy surface, often with a bluish-green hue on top. It produces catkins in early spring, which are typical of willow species, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
