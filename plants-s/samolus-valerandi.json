    "intro": "Samolus valerandi, commonly known as lesser mouse-ear or mouse-ear speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Samolus valerandi is known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming extensive ground cover in suitable habitats."
