    "intro": "Salix macrostipularis, commonly known as the large-stipitate willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many willow species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family."
