It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to reveal winged seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. The tree is also valued for its wood and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
