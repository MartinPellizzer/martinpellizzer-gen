    "intro": "Sempervivum hirtum subsp. neilreichii, commonly known as the Neilreich's houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the Alps. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green with a woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
