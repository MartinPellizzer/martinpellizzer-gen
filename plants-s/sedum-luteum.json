    "intro": "Sedum luteum, commonly known as the yellow stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum luteum is also known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil."
