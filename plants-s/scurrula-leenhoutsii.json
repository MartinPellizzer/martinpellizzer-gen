It is a member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and colorful, ephemeral flowers. The plant is known for its short blooming period, often opening only at night and closing by morning. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, with a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. Scurrula leenhoutsii is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration."
