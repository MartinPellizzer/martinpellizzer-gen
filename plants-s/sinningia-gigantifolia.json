    "intro": "Sinningia gigantifolia, commonly known as the angel's wings, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sinningia gigantifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
