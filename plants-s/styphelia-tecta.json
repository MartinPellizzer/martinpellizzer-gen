    "intro": "Styphelia tecta, commonly known as the mistletoe plant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that attaches itself to the branches of eucalyptus trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, and it is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Styphelia tecta plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for various insect species."
