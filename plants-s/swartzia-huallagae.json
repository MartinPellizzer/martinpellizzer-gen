    "intro": "Swartzia huallagae, commonly known as the Huallaga swartzia, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest of Peru. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and legume pods. The plant is notable for its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in local crafts and traditional uses.
