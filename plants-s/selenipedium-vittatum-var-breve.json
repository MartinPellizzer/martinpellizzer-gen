    "intro": "Selenipedium vittatum var. breve, commonly known as the short-stemmed hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, hood-like flowers that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many regions."
