    "intro": "Stenocoryne longicornis, commonly known as the longhorned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Apocynaceae family. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, often causing a rash upon contact with the skin. Stenocoryne longicornis is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
