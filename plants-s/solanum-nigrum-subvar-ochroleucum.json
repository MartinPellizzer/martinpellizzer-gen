    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subvar. ochroleucum, commonly known as the white-fruited black nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, green berries which turn black when ripe. Its berries contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested, though they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, wastelands, and along roadsides."
