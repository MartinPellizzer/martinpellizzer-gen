    "intro": "Sorbus rubiginosa, commonly known as the red mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
