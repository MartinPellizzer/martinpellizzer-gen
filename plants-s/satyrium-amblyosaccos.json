    "intro": "Satyrium amblyosaccos, commonly known as the narrow-sac orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves, and its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive sac-like structure at the base of the lip. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, where it grows in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
