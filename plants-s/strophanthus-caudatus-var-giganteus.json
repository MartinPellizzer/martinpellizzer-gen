    "intro": "Strophanthus caudatus var. giganteus, commonly known as the giant African rue, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, dark berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing as a shrub or small tree. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in gardens with children or pets."
