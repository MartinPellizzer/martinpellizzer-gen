It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain small, dark seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
