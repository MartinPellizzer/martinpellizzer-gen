    "intro": "Sempervivum wulfenii subsp. juvanii, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, green to blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the summer months. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
