    "intro": "Sagittaria esculenta, commonly known as arrowhead or\u6c34\u4e2d_arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom above the water, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in wetlands and marshes. Its edible tubers have been used by indigenous peoples for food and are also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
