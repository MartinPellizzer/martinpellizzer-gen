It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
