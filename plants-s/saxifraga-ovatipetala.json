    "intro": "Saxifraga ovatipetala, commonly known as the broad-leafed saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga ovatipetala is often found in mountainous areas and is a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
