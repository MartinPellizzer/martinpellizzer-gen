    "intro": "Salix orogenes, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually unisexual. Salix orogenes is adapted to cold, arid environments and can thrive in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates as an ornamental plant."
