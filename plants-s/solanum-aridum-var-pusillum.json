    "intro": "Solanum aridum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small perennial plant characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other solanum species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
