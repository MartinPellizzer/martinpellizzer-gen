    "intro": "Sphenopholis palustris var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled or twisted, giving it its varietal name. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually green or brown in color. This variant is notable for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
