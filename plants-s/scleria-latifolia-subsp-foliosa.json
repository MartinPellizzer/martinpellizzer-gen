It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a robust root system. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, often arranged in spikelets. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
