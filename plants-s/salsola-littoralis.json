It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. Its small, green flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Salsola littoralis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
