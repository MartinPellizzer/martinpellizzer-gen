    "intro": "Sarcoglottis picta var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated sarcoglottis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves with a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically surrounded by a spathe, a modified leaf-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. The variegation in its foliage is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution."
