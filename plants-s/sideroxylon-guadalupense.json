It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
