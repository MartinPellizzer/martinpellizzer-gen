    "intro": "Scirpus gramineus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears small, three-lobed flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lake shores, and wet meadows. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus gramineus plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and filtering water."
