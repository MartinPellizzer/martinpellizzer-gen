    "intro": "Sisymbrium diffusum var. jaegeri, commonly known as the common yellow rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. This variety is native to Europe but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain habitats."
