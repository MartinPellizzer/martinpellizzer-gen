    "intro": "Scirpus lenticularis, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spiky inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Scirpus lenticularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
