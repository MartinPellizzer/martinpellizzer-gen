    "intro": "Senna racemosa, commonly known as the sickle senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring pinnate leaves with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense racemes, which are typically pollinated by bees and other insects. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Senna racemosa is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine."
