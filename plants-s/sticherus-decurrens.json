    "intro": "Sticherus decurrens, commonly known as the narrowleaf sticherus, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the carrot family. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Sticherus decurrens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
