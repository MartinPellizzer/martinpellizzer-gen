    "intro": "Serianthes nelsonii, commonly known as the giant ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, rugged bark that provides protection against fires and pests. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Serianthes nelsonii is known for its extremely hard wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a critically endangered species."
