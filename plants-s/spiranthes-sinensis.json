    "intro": "Spiranthes sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to East Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that spiral around the stem, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
