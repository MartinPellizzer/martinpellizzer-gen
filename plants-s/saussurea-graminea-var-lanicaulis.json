It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in meadows and rocky areas of mountainous regions."
