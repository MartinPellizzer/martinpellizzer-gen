    "intro": "Saxifraga condensata, commonly known as the dense saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga condensata is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
