    "intro": "Stapelia pillansii var. fontinalis, commonly known as the Cape Town Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are borne on short, erect pedicels and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
