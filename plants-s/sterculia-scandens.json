    "intro": "Sterculia scandens, commonly known as the climbing sterculia, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is a woody vine that can grow quite long, often climbing trees or other structures for support. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The leaves are usually large, palmate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
