    "intro": "Senecio sangayensis, commonly known as the Sangay groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Senecio sangayensis is known for its yellowish to orange-colored flowers, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators."
