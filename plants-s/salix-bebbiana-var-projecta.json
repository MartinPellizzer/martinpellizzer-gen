    "intro": "Salix bebbiana var. projecta, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often boggy environments. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, slightly hairy texture. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
