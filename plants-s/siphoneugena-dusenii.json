    "intro": "Siphoneugena dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's siphonostele, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Siphoneugena dusenii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
