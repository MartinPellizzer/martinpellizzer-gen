It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but often used ornamentally. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic and functional plantings."
