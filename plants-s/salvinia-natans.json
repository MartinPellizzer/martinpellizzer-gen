    "intro": "Salvinia natans, commonly known as floating moss, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has finely divided, thread-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with tiny roots extending into the water. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams, where it can form dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
