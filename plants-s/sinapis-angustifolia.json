    "intro": "Sinapis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Sinapis angustifolia has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
