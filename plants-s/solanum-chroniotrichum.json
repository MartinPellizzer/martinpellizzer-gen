    "intro": "Solanum chroniotrichum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains seeds, and the plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
