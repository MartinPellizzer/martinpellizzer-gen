    "intro": "Salix amygdalina var. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and bright green on the upper surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature into fluffy seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
