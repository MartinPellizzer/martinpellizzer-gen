    "intro": "Stipa rudis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Stipa rudis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
