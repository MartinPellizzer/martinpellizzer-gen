    "intro": "Selaginella martensii f. albolineata, commonly known as the white-lined spikemoss, is a low-growing fern ally native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green with distinctive white or pale lines running along their length. This fern ally thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the tips of its stems and produce spores. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
