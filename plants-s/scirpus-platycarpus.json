    "intro": "Scirpus platycarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, three-lobed leaves and cylindrical inflorescences that bear dark brown, three-angled berries. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Scirpus platycarpus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
