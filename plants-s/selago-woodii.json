    "intro": "Selago woodii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It lacks traditional leaves and instead has a unique, slender stem that supports its showy, white, orchid-like flowers. The plant is adapted to grow on the trunks of trees in wet, shaded habitats, often in swamps or pine flatwoods. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations for nutrient absorption and its role in ecological studies. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
