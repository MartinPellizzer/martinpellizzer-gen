    "intro": "Stachyarrhena, commonly known as the purple bottlebrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes. The flowers are typically bright red, pink, or purple, and they are clustered in dense, brush-like formations. Stachyarrhena species are often shrubs or small trees, with aromatic leaves that have a subtle, resinous scent. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
