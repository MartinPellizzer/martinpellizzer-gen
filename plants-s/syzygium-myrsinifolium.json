It is native to Australia and is characterized by its showy, red bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with elliptical, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive red calyx that persists after the petals fall.
