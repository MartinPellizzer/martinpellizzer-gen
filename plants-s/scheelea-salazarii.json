    "intro": "Scheelea salazarii, commonly known as the Salazar's palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by clustered, orange-red fruits. Scheelea salazarii thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
