It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Salvia minarum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
