    "intro": "Sciothamnus, commonly known as the silver sagebrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to North America, particularly found in the western United States and parts of Canada. The plants are typically shrubs with silvery-gray foliage, which helps them retain moisture in arid environments. They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Sciothamnus species are adapted to dry, rocky soils and are often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
