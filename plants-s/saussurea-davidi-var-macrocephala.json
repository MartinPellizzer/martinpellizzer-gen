    "intro": "Saussurea davidi var. macrocephala, commonly known as the giant Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a robust root system and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
