    "intro": "Santia monspeliensis, commonly known as the Monspelais santia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its slender stems and small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
