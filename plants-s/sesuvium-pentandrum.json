    "intro": "Sesuvium pentandrum, commonly known as sea Purslane, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are extensive and help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Sesuvium pentandrum is widely distributed along shorelines and salt marshes in tropical and subtropical regions."
