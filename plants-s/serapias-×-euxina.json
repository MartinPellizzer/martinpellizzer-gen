    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 euxina, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Serapias acaulis and Serapias parviflora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Serapias \u00d7 euxina is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
