It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often with a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
