    "intro": "Salix vagans f. depressa, commonly known as the flatwillow, is a shrub-like plant belonging to the willow family (Salicaceae). It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth, which helps it thrive in wet or moist environments. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of silky hair, giving them a soft texture. This form of Salix vagans is a naturally occurring variant, distinguished by its flattened growth pattern compared to the typical upright form. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and saturated soils."
