    "intro": "Stenandrium corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. Its flowering pattern is notable for its showy, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Stenandrium corymbosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its vibrant floral display."
