    "intro": "Soldanella pusilla f. diversifolia, commonly known as the dwarf snowdrop, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pendulous flowers on slender stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine collections."
