It features a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
