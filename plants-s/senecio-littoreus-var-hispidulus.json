    "intro": "Senecio littoreus var. hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy sea heath, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal invertebrates."
