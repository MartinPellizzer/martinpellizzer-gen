    "intro": "Symplocos laeviramulosa, commonly known as the smoothleaf wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are smooth on both sides, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Symplocos laeviramulosa typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
