It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow-orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
