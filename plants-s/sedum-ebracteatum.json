    "intro": "Sedum ebracteatum, commonly known as the silver rose, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in fleshy, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
