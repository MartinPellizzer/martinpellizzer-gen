    "intro": "Saxifraga arctica, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the short growing season of polar summers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Saxifraga arctica is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
