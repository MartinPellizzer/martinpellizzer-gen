    "intro": "Sarcostemma glaucum, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, a common feature among plants in the Apocynaceae family. Sarcostemma glaucum thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas or along the edges of cultivated land."
