    "intro": "Salix arbutifolia var. macrostachia, commonly known as the large-stamened willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, with the male inflorescences being notably larger than the female ones, a feature that gives it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
