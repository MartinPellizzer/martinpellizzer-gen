    "intro": "Sedum glaebosum, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum glaebosum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
