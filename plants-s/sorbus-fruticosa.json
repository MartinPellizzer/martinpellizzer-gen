    "intro": "Sorbus fruticosa, commonly known as common snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces bright red berries that are attractive to birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, turning yellow in autumn before falling. Sorbus fruticosa is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
