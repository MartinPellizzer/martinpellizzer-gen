    "intro": "Scleria robinsoniana subsp. acanthocarpa, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its robust, spiky fruiting structures, which aid in seed dispersal."
