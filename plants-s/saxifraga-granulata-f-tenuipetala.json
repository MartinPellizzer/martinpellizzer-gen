    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata f. tenuipetala, commonly known as the slender-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
