    "intro": "Strophacanthus dichotomus, commonly known as the dichotomous strophacanthus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique branching pattern, with stems dividing into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive dichotomous growth habit. The plant typically features small, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its flowers are simple and clustered, producing small, pale yellow blooms that are not particularly showy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
