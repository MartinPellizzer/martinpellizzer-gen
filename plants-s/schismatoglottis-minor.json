It is a terrestrial herb with narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Schismatoglottis minor is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
