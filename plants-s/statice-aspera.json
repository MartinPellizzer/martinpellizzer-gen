    "intro": "Statice aspera, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in salty, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to tolerate wind and salt spray. Statice aspera is also popular in floral arrangements for its long-lasting blooms and vibrant color."
