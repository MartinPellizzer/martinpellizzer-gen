    "intro": "Schistogyne mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's schistogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide range of flowering plants, many of which are economically important. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, typical of many shrubs in its family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it competes for light and nutrients. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Schistogyne mandonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
