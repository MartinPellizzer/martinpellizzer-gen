    "intro": "Solena, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically yellow and are surrounded by a dense, woolly layer of leaves. Solena species are native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and are often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage and bloom."
