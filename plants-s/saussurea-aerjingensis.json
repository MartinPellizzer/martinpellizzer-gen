It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rhizomes are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
