    "intro": "Salmea curviflora var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf salmea, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in loose, branching clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
