    "intro": "Selliguea tafana, commonly known as the Tafana moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, closely packed leaves and a thalloid structure. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal. Selliguea tafana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
