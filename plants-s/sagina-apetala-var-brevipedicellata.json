    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the narrow-peduncled sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of short pedicels. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. This variety is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to other varieties within the Sagina apetala species."
