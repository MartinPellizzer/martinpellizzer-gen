    "intro": "Scabiosa villosa, commonly known as the downy scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and open woodlands. Scabiosa villosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
