    "intro": "Sorbus porrigens, commonly known as the roughleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits called pomes, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks."
