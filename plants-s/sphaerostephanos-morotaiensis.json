    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos morotaiensis, commonly known as the Morotai starflower, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the island of Morotai in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in forest undergrowth, and has a compact, herbaceous appearance. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status remains uncertain."
