    "intro": "Serratula ortholepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sagewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, demonstrating a high degree of adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Serratula ortholepis is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory effects."
