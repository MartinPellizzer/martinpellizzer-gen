    "intro": "Saxifraga stelleriana var. pubifolia, commonly known as the pubescent starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to extreme environments."
