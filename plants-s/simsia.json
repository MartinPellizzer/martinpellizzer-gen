    "intro": "Simsia, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"yellow buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow flowers that resemble those of the true buttercup, though they are not closely related. Simsia species typically grow in moist, temperate environments and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The leaves are usually deeply lobed and can vary in shape depending on the species. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
