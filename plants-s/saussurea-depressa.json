    "intro": "Saussurea depressa, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas and Tibet. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
