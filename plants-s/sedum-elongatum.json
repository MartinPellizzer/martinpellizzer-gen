    "intro": "Sedum elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and cylindrical, adapted to store water in arid environments. Sedum elongatum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
