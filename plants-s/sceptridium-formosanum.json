    "intro": "Sceptridium formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan fan-fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
