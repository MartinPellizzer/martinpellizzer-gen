    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. recta, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features compact rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. It is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it can withstand strong winds and limited soil. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
