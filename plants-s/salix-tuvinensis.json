    "intro": "Salix tuvinensis, commonly known as the Tuvinian willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped. It has adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Salix tuvinensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest for ecological and horticultural studies."
