    "intro": "Salix kenoensis, commonly known as the Keno willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streams and riverbanks. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in riparian ecosystems."
