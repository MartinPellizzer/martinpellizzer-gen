    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 montana, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a hybrid species of willow that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are clustered in both male and female inflorescences. It is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in rocky areas. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
