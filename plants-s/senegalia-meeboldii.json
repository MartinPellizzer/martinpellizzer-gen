    "intro": "Senegalia meeboldii, commonly known as the meebold acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its yellow, globular flower heads. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Senegalia meeboldii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes."
