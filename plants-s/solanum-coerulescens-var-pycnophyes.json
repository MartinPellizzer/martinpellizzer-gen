    "intro": "Solanum coerulescens var. pycnophyes, commonly known as the dense-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces violet-black berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
