    "intro": "Stiefia, commonly known as the \"saddle-back plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique, spiky, and often branched inflorescence that resembles a saddle or a crown. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is native to regions such as Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. Stiefia species are known for their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. These plants are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance and adaptability to moist environments."
