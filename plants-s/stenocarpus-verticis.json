    "intro": "Stenocarpus verticis, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing some protection against fire and environmental stress. Stenocarpus verticis is often found in rocky or sandy soils in coastal and mountainous regions."
