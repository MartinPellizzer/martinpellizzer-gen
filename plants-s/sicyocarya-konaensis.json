    "intro": "Sicyocarya konaensis, commonly known as the Kona sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to the dry, coastal environments of Hawaii. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
