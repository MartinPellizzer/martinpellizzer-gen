It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Simocheilus glaber plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
