    "intro": "Sedum hirsutum, commonly known as the woolly sedum, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving the plant its \"woolly\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This hardy plant is also known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its water-storing leaves."
