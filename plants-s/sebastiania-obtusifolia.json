    "intro": "Sebastiania obtusifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green, almost waxy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. Its small, clustered flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces distinctive, bead-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Sebastiania obtusifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
