    "intro": "Schismatoglottis hottae, commonly known as the Hotta's schismatoglottis, is a rare tropical orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a tight cluster, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
