    "intro": "Sedum multicaule, commonly known as the many-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch out, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Sedum multicaule is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
