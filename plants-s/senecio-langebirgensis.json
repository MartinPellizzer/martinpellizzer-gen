    "intro": "Senecio langebirgensis, commonly known as Langeberg's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
