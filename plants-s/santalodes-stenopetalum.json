    "intro": "Santalodes stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled sandalwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic shrub, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
