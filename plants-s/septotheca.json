    "intro": "Septotheca, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble sea urchins, hence their common name. Septotheca species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. They have a low-growing habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help them retain moisture in arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds via the wind."
