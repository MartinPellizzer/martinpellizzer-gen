    "intro": "Serratula legionensis, commonly known as the legionnaires' weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in arid environments. Its leaves are serrated and grass-like, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. It is considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
