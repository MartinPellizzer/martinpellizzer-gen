    "intro": "Stipa virletii, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands, often in areas with poor soil. Stipa virletii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
