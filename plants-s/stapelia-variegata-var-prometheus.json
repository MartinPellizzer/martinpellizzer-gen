    "intro": "Stapelia variegata var. prometheus, commonly known as the Prometheus Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The varietal form 'prometheus' is notable for its unique coloration and growth habit compared to other Stapelia species."
