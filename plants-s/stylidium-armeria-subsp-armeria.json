    "intro": "Stylidium armeria subsp. armeria, commonly known as the narrowleaf stickyplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces sticky secretions on its leaves and stems, which help in trapping small insects. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as roadsides and coastal areas. This subspecies is part of the family Haemodoraceae, known for its showy, often brightly colored flowers."
