    "intro": "Saxifraga fallax, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
