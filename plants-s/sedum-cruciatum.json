    "intro": "Sedum cruciatum, commonly known as the cross-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, cross-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum cruciatum is also valued for its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
