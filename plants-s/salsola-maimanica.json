    "intro": "Salsola maimanica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and small, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dry, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
