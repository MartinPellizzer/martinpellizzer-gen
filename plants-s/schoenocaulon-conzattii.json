    "intro": "Schoenocaulon conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's mountain-mugwort, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties used by local indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
