It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Senecio triodontiphyllus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
