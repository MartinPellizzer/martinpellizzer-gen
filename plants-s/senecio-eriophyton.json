    "intro": "Senecio eriophyton, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
