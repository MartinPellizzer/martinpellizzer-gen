    "intro": "Steganthera, commonly known as the \"tiger bean\" or \"arrowhead plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often heart-shaped or arrowhead-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Steganthera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. These plants are often grown for their ornamental value and, in some cases, for their edible seeds."
