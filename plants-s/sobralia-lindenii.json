    "intro": "Sobralia lindenii, commonly known as the Lindens' sobralia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of multiple orchid-like flowers with bright colors, often in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Sobralia lindenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, tropical climates."
