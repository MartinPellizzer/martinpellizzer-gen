    "intro": "Stelis sumacoensis, commonly known as the Sumaco orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
