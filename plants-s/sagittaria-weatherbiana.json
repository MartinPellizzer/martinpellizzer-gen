    "intro": "Sagittaria weatherbiana, commonly known as the Florida arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and marshes, often forming dense mats on the water surface or along the edges. The plant has strap-like, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Sagittaria weatherbiana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
