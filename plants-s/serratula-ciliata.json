    "intro": "Serratula ciliata, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Serratula ciliata is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
