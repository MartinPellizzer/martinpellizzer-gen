    "intro": "Syringa \u00d7 hyacinthiflora, commonly known as the weeping cherry or Japanese weeping cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its cascading branches that bear clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant's botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, combining traits from Syringa (lilac) and the floral structure of hyacinth. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and has heart-shaped, dark green leaves. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms."
