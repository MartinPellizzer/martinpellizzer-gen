    "intro": "Salix ignicoma, commonly known as the fire willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Salix ignicoma plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
