    "intro": "Serratula pectinata, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are serrated and pinnately divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The bright yellow flowers bloom in summer and are followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
