It is native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a glossy surface that helps it retain moisture. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
