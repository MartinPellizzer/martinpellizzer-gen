    "intro": "Solanum parcebarbatum var. minorifrons, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. These flowers give way to small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as undergrowth in tropical forests."
