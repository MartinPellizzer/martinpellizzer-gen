    "intro": "Saxifraga crassifolia var. hawortiana, commonly known as the Hawort's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features a low-growing rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, appearing in late summer. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
