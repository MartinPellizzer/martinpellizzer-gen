    "intro": "Suaeda divaricata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other arid or saline habitats. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
