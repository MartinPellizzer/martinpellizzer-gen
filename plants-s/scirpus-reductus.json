    "intro": "Scirpus reductus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, are composed of small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus reductus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
