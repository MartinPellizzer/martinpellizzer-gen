    "intro": "Schizocarphus acerosus, commonly known as the hard-leaved schizocarph, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a schizocarp fruit, which splits into two parts when mature, a distinctive feature of the genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
