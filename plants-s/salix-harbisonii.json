    "intro": "Salix harbisonii, commonly known as Harbison's willow, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces catkins as its primary reproductive structure. It is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a sensitive indicator of environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix harbisonii is considered vulnerable to ecological disturbances."
