    "intro": "Sorghum subglabrescens var. oviforme, commonly known as the ovate sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species characterized by its distinctive ovate-shaped leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient grass species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that produce small, two-lobed grains. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential use in both traditional agriculture and ecological restoration projects."
