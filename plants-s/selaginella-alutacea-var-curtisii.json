    "intro": "Selaginella alutacea var. curtisii, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a dense rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Selaginella alutacea var. curtisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
