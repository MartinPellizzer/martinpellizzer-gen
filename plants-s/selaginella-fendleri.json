    "intro": "Selaginella fendleri, commonly known as the desert spikerush, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant has a distinctive appearance with spiky, needle-like leaves and produces cone-like structures for reproduction. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions through its ability to enter a state of dormancy during periods of extreme drought. Selaginella fendleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
