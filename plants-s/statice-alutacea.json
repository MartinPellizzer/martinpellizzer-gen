    "intro": "Statice alutacea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray, adapted to tolerate salty air and sandy soils. Statice alutacea is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental appeal."
