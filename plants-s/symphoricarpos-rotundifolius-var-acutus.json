    "intro": "Symphoricarpos rotundifolius var. acutus, commonly known as the sharpleaf snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features compound leaves with elongated, sharply pointed leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible for birds and small mammals, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats."
