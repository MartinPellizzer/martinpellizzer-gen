    "intro": "Scalia aristata, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and subalpine zones. Scalia aristata is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
