    "intro": "Sambucus fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated, fringed edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but are generally toxic when unripe. Sambucus fimbriata is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
