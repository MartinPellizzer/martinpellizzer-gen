    "intro": "Salix pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix pringlei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
