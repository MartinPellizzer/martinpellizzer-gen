    "intro": "Sessea pedicellata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
