    "intro": "Selaginella amblyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features creeping stems that produce upright, spore-bearing cones at the tips, which are used for reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Selaginella amblyphylla is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appearance in horticulture."
