    "intro": "Solanum rybinii f. ciezae, commonly known as the Cieza's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are typically toxic but have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
