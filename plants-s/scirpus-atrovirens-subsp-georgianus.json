    "intro": "Scirpus atrovirens subsp. georgianus, commonly known as the Georgian bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Caucasus region. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that mature into dark, spherical berries. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
