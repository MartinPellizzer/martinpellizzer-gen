    "intro": "Stevia dianthoidea, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intensely sweet leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as alternatives to sugar. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for both ornamental and commercial cultivation. Due to its low water requirements and adaptability, it is often grown in subtropical and tropical regions."
