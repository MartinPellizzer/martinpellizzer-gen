    "intro": "Salgada lauriflora, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like birds and bees. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tidal zones. Due to its salt tolerance, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping and restoration projects."
