It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by white, spiny bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments.

Schoberia maritima is an important plant for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
