    "intro": "Saxifraga anisophylla, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga anisophylla is often found in alpine meadows and is a characteristic species of mountain ecosystems."
