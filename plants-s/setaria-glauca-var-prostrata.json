    "intro": "Setaria glauca var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate green millet, is a low-growing annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
