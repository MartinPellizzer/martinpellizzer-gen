    "intro": "Salix pyramidalis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources."
