    "intro": "Satureja acinos var. minor, commonly known as dwarf mountain savory, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically features small, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, pungent aroma, and it produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This variety is smaller than the typical Satureja acinos, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays."
