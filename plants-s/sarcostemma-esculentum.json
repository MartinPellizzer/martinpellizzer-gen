    "intro": "Sarcostemma esculentum, commonly known as the edible milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. Its latex is milky and can cause skin irritation, though the young shoots are sometimes consumed as a vegetable. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides."
