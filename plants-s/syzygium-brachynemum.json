    "intro": "Syzygium brachynemum, commonly known as the small-leaf tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often shedding in thin layers as the tree matures. Syzygium brachynemum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine."
