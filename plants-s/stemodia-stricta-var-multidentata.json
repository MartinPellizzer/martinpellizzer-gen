    "intro": "Stemodia stricta var. multidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stemodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with multiple serrations along the edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers a dry climate."
