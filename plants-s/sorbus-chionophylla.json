    "intro": "Sorbus chionophylla, commonly known as the snowleaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
