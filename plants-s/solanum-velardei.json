    "intro": "Solanum velardei, commonly known as the Velarde's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with five petals, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans. Due to its restricted habitat, Solanum velardei is considered a rare and endangered species."
