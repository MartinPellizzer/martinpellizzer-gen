    "intro": "Selaginella increscentifolia, commonly known as the increasing frond spikeweed, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that grow in whorls around the stem. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry, where it can lose and regain water without damage. Its reproductive structures, known as microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls. Selaginella increscentifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops."
