It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
