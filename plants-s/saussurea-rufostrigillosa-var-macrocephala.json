    "intro": "Saussurea rufostrigillosa var. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by numerous disk florets, which are typically tubular in shape. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. This variant is notable for its distinctive floral structure and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
