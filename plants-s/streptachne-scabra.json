    "intro": "Streptachne scabra, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its wiry, tufted growth habit and rough, scabrous leaf surfaces that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are often hairy and bristly. Streptachne scabra is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
