    "intro": "Schubertia auricoma, commonly known as the auriculate schubertia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows from a bulb and produces multiple stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves. Schubertia auricoma is well adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscaping."
