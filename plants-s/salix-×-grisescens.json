    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 grisescens, commonly known as the grey willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus. It is characterized by its greyish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. This plant is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. The grey willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
