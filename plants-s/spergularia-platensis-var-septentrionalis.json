    "intro": "Spergularia platensis var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems and leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
