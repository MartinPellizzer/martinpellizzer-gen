    "intro": "Sorbus prattii f. subarachnoidea, commonly known as the silver-leaf whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-white leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central China, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
