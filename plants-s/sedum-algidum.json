    "intro": "Sedum algidum, commonly known as the alpine sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-resistant plants."
