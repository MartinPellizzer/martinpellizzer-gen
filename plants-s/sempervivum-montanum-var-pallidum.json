It features rosettes of fleshy, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun and cold climates. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
