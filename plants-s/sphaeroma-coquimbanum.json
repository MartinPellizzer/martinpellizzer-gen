    "intro": "Sphaeroma coquimbanum, commonly known as the Coquimbo mud crab, is a species of crab belonging to the family Grapsidae. It is characterized by its small to medium size and a robust, rounded carapace that is often covered in fine granules. This crab is typically found in intertidal zones, where it inhabits muddy or sandy substrates. Its diet consists mainly of detritus and small invertebrates, which it forages for during low tide. The species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger predators."
