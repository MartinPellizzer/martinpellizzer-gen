    "intro": "Solanum circaeifolium, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum circaeifolium is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
