    "intro": "Syringa velutina, commonly known as velvet hips or velvet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Syringa velutina thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
