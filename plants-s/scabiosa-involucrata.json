It is characterized by its clusters of small, sky-blue to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Its flowers are composed of numerous tiny petals arranged in a radiate pattern, typical of the Asteraceae family. Scabiosa involucrata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
