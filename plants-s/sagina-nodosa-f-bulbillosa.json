It features small, rounded leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a hardy and resilient species."
