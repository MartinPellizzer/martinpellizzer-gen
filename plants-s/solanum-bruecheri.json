    "intro": "Solanum bruecheri, commonly known as the Bruecher's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
