    "intro": "Stelis brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a short, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing nutrients. Stelis brevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
