    "intro": "Solanum decurrens, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a bright yellow or orange color. Solanum decurrens is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
