    "intro": "Stipa scabra, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. Stipa scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
