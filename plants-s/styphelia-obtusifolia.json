    "intro": "Styphelia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with broad, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Styphelia obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
