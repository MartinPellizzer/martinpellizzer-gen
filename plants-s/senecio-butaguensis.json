It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Senecio butaguensis is adapted to cold, arid conditions and is often found in mountainous areas of Argentina and Chile."
