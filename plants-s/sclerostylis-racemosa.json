    "intro": "Sclerostylis racemosa, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in racemose inflorescences. The plant has thick, fleshy roots adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
