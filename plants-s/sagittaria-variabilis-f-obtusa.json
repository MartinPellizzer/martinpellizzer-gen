    "intro": "Sagittaria variabilis f. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or extend underwater, with a distinct broad base. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
