    "intro": "Selaginella flabellata var. flabellata, commonly known as the clubmoss or spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous stem with closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as microsporangia and megasporangia, are found on specialized stalks called strobila. This species is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction."
