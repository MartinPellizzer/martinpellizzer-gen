    "intro": "Sabulina basaltica, commonly known as the basalt rock-sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky, volcanic soils in high-altitude regions. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments, often found in alpine or subalpine zones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices, allowing it to withstand harsh weather conditions. Sabulina basaltica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is an indicator species for volcanic landscapes."
