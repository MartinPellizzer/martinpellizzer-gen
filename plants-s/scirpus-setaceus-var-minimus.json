    "intro": "Scirpus setaceus var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in height, giving it its \"dwarf\" designation. Its small, cylindrical flower spikes are usually found in clusters at the top of the stems. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
