    "intro": "Stachys albicaulis var. candidissima, commonly known as the white-haired betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wildflower meadows."
