    "intro": "Styphelia pedicellata, commonly known as the pink heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Styphelia pedicellata thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
