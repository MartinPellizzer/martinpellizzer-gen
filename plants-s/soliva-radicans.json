    "intro": "Soliva radicans, commonly known as common velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender, leafless stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Soliva radicans is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
