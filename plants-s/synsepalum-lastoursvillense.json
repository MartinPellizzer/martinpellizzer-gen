    "intro": "Synsepalum lastoursvillense, commonly known as the lastoursvillense miracle fruit, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and hairy calyces that enclose its small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These berries contain a single seed and are known for their distinctive, tangy flavor, which is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
