    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
