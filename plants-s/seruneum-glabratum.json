    "intro": "Seruneum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth seruneum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, with a smooth, glabrous surface that gives it its common name. Seruneum glabratum thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
