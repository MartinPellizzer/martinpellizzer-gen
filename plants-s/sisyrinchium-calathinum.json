    "intro": "Sisyrinchium calathinum, commonly known as the golden cupido, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, seed-like fruits called cypsela. Sisyrinchium calathinum is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
