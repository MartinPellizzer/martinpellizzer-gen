    "intro": "Scassellatia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that often display a vibrant yellow or orange hue. They are typically herbaceous perennials native to regions of southern Africa. Scassellatia species often grow in rocky or sandy soils and prefer full sun to partial shade. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to their ecological importance in their native habitats."
