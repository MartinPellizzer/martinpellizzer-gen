    "intro": "Stipa pennata, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted clusters of fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Stipa pennata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
