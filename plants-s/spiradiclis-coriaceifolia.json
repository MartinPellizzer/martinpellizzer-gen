    "intro": "Spiradiclis coriaceifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf spiradiclis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sturdy, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Spiradiclis coriaceifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a hardy species well adapted to temperate climates."
