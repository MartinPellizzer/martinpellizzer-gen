    "intro": "Semecarpus archboldianus, commonly known as the Bornean chestnut, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and unique fruit structure. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
