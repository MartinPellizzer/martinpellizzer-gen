    "intro": "Serratula pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered sickleweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central and western North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that are often spoon-shaped. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, elongated inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Serratula pauciflora is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environment."
