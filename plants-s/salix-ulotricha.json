    "intro": "Salix ulotricha, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin strips. Salix ulotricha is adapted to arid environments and is often found in riparian zones and disturbed soils."
