    "intro": "Stellaria saxatilis f. petiolata, commonly known as the petiolated starwort, is a botanical variant of the starwort species. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its slender, petioled leaves that distinguish it from the typical form. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in studies of plant adaptation to harsh climates."
