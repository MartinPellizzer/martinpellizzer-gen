    "intro": "Senecio lacerus, commonly known as the shredded carpet or ragged rockweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant characterized by its slender, often branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs and exhibit a distinctive, shredded appearance due to their irregular, frayed margins. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is native to southern Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
