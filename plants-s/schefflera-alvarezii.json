    "intro": "Schefflera alvarezii, commonly known as the Alvarez's umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of large, palmate leaves that give it a unique, umbrella-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Schefflera alvarezii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ease of care."
