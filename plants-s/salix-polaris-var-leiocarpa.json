    "intro": "Salix polaris var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-barked willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silky hair, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and thrives in moist, often boggy environments. This resilient plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
