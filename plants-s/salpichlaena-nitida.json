It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, silver-green fronds that are often used in horticulture for ornamental purposes. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are bi-directionally pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Salpichlaena nitida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
