It belongs to the family Posidoniaceae and is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, sandy-bottom habitats and forms dense underwater meadows. Stegostyla atrata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its reproductive structures, including small flowers, are adapted for pollination by water currents."
