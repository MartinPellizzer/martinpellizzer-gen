    "intro": "Sphaeranthus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found on limestone outcrops and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Sphaeranthus calcareus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
