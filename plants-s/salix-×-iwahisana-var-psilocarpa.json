    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 iwahisana var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the psychedelic willow, is a hybrid willow species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces unique fruiting bodies that contain psychoactive compounds, particularly psilocybin, making it notable in both botanical and ethnobotanical contexts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forested areas. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is of interest to researchers and has cultural significance in certain traditional practices."
