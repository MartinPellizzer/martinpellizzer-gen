    "intro": "Selinum suffruticosum, commonly known as rock garlic or desert garlic, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
