    "intro": "Sanguisorba rectispica f. longifila, commonly known as the long-flowered narrowleaf sorrel, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branching stems. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of small, red-tinged flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
