    "intro": "Sabulina hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Sabulina hybrida is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in mountainous and coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics reflect its ability to thrive in extreme climates with limited nutrients."
