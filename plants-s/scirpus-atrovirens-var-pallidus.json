    "intro": "Scirpus atrovirens var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush characterized by its lighter green foliage. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are typically greenish or pale brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
