    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. umbellata, commonly known as the white-berried rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of white, highly fragrant flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that turn yellow or orange in the fall, which are edible for humans and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often turning bright red in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas."
