    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum sipapoense, commonly known as the Sierra Leone sand forest tree, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Sierra Leone Highlands. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforest ecosystem. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, while its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum sipapoense is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
