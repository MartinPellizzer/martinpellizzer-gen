    "intro": "Solanum esculentum var. inerme, commonly known as the wild tomato, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, green fruits resembling miniature tomatoes. Its fruits are edible but often have a tart flavor compared to cultivated tomatoes. This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs."
