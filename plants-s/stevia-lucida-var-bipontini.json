    "intro": "Stevia lucida var. bipontini, commonly known as the silverleaf stevia, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Stevia lucida var. bipontini is valued for its use in herbal medicine and as a natural sweetener due to its high steviol glycoside content."
