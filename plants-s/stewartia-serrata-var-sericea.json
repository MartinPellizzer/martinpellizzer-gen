    "intro": "Stewartia serrata var. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf stewartia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or whitish down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red or orange capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
