    "intro": "Scabiosa pilosa, commonly known as the hairy scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it produces tiny, fluffy seed heads that are attractive to pollinators. Scabiosa pilosa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is a hardy perennial that is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
