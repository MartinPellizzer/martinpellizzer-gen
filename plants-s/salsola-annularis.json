    "intro": "Salsola annularis, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with fleshy, spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in many regions. Salsola annularis is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in dry landscapes."
