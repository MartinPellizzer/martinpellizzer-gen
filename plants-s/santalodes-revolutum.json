    "intro": "Santalodes revolutum, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, woody fruits. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
