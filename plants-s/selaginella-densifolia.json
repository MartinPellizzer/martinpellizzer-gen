    "intro": "Selaginella densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate or ascending growth habit, with closely spaced, scale-like leaves that give it a dense appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of its stems and produce spores. Selaginella densifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
