    "intro": "Sericanthe andongensis subsp. engleri, commonly known as the Andong engleri orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves and produces intricate, greenish-yellow floral spikes. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
