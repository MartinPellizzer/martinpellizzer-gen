    "intro": "Solanum dallmannianum, commonly known as the Dallmann's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, and it produces small, toxic berries that are often consumed by birds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its potentially harmful properties."
