It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and vibrant color make it a visually striking addition to gardens."
