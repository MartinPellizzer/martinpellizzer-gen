    "intro": "Solanum melongena var. leucoum, commonly known as the white eggplant, is a variant of the eggplant species characterized by its pale white to pale green skin and flesh. This variety is less common than the typical purple eggplant and is often cultivated for its unique color and mild flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same genus, Solanum, as other eggplants. The plant produces large, bell-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when they are still firm and unripe. Its botanical features include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and flowers with five white petals."
