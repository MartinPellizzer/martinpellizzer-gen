    "intro": "Sagina subulata var. revelierei, commonly known as the snowweed or silver moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features tiny, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure, it is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, rocky soils."
