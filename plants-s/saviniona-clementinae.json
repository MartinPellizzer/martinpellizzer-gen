It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sunny environments. Its botanical features include a creeping rhizomatous growth habit and showy composite flowers that attract pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
