    "intro": "Salix caperata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Salix caperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
