    "intro": "Saxifraga pedemontana subsp. cervicornis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
