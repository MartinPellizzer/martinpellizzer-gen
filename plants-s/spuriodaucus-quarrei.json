It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
