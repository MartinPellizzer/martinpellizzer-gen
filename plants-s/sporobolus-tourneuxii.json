    "intro": "Sporobolus tourneuxii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardening. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. The plant's botanical features include narrow leaves and a compact growth habit that helps it conserve water efficiently."
