    "intro": "Solanum reptans, commonly known as creeping nightshade, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, producing small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. The plant bears small, oval berries that start green and ripen to a bright red, containing toxic seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in gardens and agricultural settings."
