It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This plant is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense clusters, and it reproduces through wind pollination. Salicornia praecox var. praecox is also valued for its edible shoots, which are used in culinary applications in various cultures."
