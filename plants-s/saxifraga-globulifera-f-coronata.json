    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera f. coronata, commonly known as the crown saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features compact, rosette-like foliage with broad, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This frost-tender species is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
