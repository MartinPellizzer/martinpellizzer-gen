    "intro": "Solanum luxurians, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the evening. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, mature to a dark red or black color. Solanum luxurians is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
