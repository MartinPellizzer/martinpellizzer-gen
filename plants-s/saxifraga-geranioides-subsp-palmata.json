    "intro": "Saxifraga geranioides subsp. palmata, commonly known as the palmate saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive, almost palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
