    "intro": "Salacia oblonga var. kakkayamana, commonly known as the Kakkayamana salacia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Salaceae and is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of plant biodiversity in tropical ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to validate its uses."
