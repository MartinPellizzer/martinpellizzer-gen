    "intro": "Salix alba var. tristis, commonly known as white willow weeping, is a variant of the white willow tree characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on top and paler underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of moist soils."
