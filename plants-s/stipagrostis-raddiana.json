    "intro": "Stipagrostis raddiana, commonly known as the red grass or red oat grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red to purple-colored inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is often found in sandy or well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that contrasts with the vibrant inflorescence. Stipagrostis raddiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its visual interest."
