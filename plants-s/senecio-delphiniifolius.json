It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to arid landscapes."
