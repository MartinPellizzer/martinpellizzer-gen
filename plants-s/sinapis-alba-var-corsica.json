    "intro": "Sinapis alba var. corsica, commonly known as Corsican white mustard, is a variant of the white mustard species native to the Mediterranean region. It is an annual herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain environments."
