    "intro": "Sphaeralcea simulans, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Sphaeralcea simulans is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
