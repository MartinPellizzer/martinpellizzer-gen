    "intro": "Solanum terminale subsp. plousianthemum, commonly known as the Turk's cap nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their raw state. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
