    "intro": "Seseli graveolens, commonly known as wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like parsley and dill. The plant features a taproot that is often used in traditional medicine, and its feathery, umbrella-like flowers are characteristic of the family. Seseli graveolens thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and along fences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
