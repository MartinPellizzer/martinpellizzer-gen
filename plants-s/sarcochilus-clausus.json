    "intro": "Sarcochilus clausus, commonly known as the closed-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a rare and specialized species. Sarcochilus clausus is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories."
