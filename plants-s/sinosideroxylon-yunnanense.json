    "intro": "Sinosideroxylon yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with a glossy dark green surface and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in subtropical and temperate forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
