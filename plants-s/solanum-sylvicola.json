    "intro": "Solanum sylvicola, commonly known as the forest tomato, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow or orange berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Its leaves are usually ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. Solanum sylvicola is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential medicinal properties."
