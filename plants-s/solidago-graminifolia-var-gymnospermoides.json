    "intro": "Solidago graminifolia var. gymnospermoides, commonly known as the gymnosperm-like goldenrod, is a variant of the goldenrod genus native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its foliage is often more linear and less lobed compared to other Solidago species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
