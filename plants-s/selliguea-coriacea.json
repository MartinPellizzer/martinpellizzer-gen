    "intro": "Selliguea coriacea, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Pterobryaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds. It is a perennial cryptogamic plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found in coastal regions. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in harsh conditions. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Selliguea coriacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other organisms in its ecosystem."
