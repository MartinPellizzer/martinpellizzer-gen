    "intro": "Saurauia aequatoriensis f. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled saurauia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which give it a unique appearance compared to other species in the genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface and a prominent midrib. The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits."
