    "intro": "Serapias tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a distinctive, hooded lip, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Serapias tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
