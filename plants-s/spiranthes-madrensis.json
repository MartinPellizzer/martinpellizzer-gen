    "intro": "Spiranthes madrensis, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1a spiral orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Madre de Dios region in Argentina. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender stem that supports its floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
