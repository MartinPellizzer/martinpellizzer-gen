    "intro": "Stipa sublaevis, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and slender, wiry culms that often form dense clumps. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Stipa sublaevis is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting and ecological restoration projects."
