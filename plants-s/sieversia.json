    "intro": "Sieversia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Sieversia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. They are annual or perennial herbs that can grow up to several feet in height, with hairy stems and leaves. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
