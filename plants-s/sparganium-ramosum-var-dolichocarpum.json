    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum var. dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited bur reed, is a variant of the bur reed species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce elongated, spiky fruits. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense stands that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The long, cylindrical fruits are adapted for dispersal by water, contributing to its spread in aquatic ecosystems."
