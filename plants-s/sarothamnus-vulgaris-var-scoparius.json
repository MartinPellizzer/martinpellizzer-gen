It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss, and its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring. It is often found in open woodlands and scrublands, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
