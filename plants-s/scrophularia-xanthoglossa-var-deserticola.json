    "intro": "Scrophularia xanthoglossa var. deserticola, commonly known as the desert scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
