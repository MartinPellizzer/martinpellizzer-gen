    "intro": "Spergularia salina var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salt concentrations in the soil. The plant has small, linear leaves that reduce water loss and are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are typically pink or red, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is less common than the typical form of Spergularia salina, but it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
