    "intro": "Sagina procumbens subsp. bryoides, commonly known as moss-like sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves that resemble moss. The plant produces tiny, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along pathways. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping for erosion control."
