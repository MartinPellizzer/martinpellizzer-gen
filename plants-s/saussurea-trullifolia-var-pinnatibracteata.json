    "intro": "Saussurea trullifolia var. pinnatibracteata, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. This variety is distinguished by its pinnately arranged bracts, which give it its specific epithet. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of mountainous regions."
