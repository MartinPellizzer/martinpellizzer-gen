    "intro": "Saprosma beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's saprosma, is a flowering plant native to the island of Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss, Saprosma beddomei is considered vulnerable, and conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique species."
