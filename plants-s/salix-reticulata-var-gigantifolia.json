    "intro": "Salix reticulata var. gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant willow, is a variant of the weeping willow characterized by its exceptionally large, drooping branches. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often silvery-white underneath, giving it a striking appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and along waterways."
