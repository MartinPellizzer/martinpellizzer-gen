    "intro": "Selinum silaifolium subsp. eichenbachii, commonly known as the Eichenbach's wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
