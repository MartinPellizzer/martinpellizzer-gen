    "intro": "Stenostomum darienense, commonly known as the Darien mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually white or pale yellow and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
