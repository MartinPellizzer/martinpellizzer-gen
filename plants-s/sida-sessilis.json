    "intro": "Sida sessilis, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sida sessilis is native to the Americas but has been introduced to various parts of the world, often becoming an invasive species. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions make it a significant agricultural weed."
