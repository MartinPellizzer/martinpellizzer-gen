It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are ovate with a waxy, bluish-green surface. Sium glaucum is characterized by its unique, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance when touched. It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
