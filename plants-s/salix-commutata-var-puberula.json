    "intro": "Salix commutata var. puberula, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, silky-haired leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically elongated and lanceolate, with a pale green upper surface and a dense layer of fine hairs on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
