    "intro": "Symphoricarpos albus f. variegatus, commonly known as the white snowberry, is a variant of the snowberry plant native to North America. It is a shrub characterized by its white, berry-like fruits that appear in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring. This cultivar is notable for its variegated foliage, which features white and green patterns, making it an ornamental choice in gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, though it can spread aggressively through runners."
