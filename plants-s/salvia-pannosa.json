    "intro": "Salvia pannosa, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants. Salvia pannosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
