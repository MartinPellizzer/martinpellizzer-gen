    "intro": "Stellaria diffusa var. ciliolata, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that bear small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped with hairy margins, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds through wind and water."
