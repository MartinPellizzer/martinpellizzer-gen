    "intro": "Senna galeottiana, commonly known as the golden senna, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Senna galeottiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
