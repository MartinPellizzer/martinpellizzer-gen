    "intro": "Salix discolor var. overii, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
