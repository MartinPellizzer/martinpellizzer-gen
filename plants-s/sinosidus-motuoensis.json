    "intro": "Sinosidus motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yarlung Zangbo River Valley in southern Tibet. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to withstand the harsh mountain climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
