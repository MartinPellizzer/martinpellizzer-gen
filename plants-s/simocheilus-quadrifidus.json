    "intro": "Simocheilus quadrifidus, commonly known as the four-lobed marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with four distinct lobes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that contribute to the wetland vegetation. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in marsh ecosystems."
