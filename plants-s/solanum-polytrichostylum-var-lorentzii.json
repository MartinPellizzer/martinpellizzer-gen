    "intro": "Solanum polytrichostylum var. lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
