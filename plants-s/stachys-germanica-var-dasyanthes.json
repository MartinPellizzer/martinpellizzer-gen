It features square, hairy stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers with pink or purplish hues. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. The variety dasyanthes is distinguished by its dense, woolly appearance compared to the standard form."
