    "intro": "Strumaria bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by two prominent teeth at the base of the corolla, giving it its scientific name. Strumaria bidentata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
