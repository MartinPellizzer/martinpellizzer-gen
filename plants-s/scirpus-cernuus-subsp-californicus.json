    "intro": "Scirpus cernuus subsp. californicus, commonly known as the California bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and stream banks, where it thrives in saturated soils. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base, while the inflorescence is a cylindrical spike that emerges from the upper stem."
