    "intro": "Shorea oleosa, commonly known as the yellow meranti, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. The tree is valued for its heavy, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Shorea oleosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
