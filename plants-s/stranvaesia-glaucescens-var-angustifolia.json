It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region."
