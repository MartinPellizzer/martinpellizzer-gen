    "intro": "Stellularia graminea var. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp star-grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent, and it produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Stellularia graminea var. uliginosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity."
