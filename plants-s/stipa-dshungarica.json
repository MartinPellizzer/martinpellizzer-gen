    "intro": "Stipa dshungarica, commonly known as the Dzungarian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands, often growing in well-drained soils. Stipa dshungarica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
