    "intro": "Spiranthes tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and long, spiraled flowering stems that produce clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. The narrowleaf ladies' tresses is often found in the eastern United States and parts of Canada."
