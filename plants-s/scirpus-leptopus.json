    "intro": "Scirpus leptopus, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant features tall, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland stabilization."
