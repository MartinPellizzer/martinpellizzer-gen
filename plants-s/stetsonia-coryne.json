    "intro": "Stetsonia coryne, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Stetsonia coryne is a perennial species that goes dormant during periods of drought, resuming growth with the arrival of rainfall."
