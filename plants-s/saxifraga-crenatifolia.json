    "intro": "Saxifraga crenatifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in moist, high-altitude environments. The plant features rosettes of dark green, serrated leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh weather conditions. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Saxifraga crenatifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in challenging ecological niches."
