    "intro": "Sphaeroma, commonly known as the moon snail, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Naticidae. It is characterized by its large, muscular foot that is used for burrowing into sandy substrates. The shell is typically smooth and rounded, often with a glossy appearance. Sphaeroma species are found in tropical and temperate coastal waters around the world. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by helping to maintain the health of sandy seabeds through their burrowing activities."
