    "intro": "Stipa gigantea subsp. lagascae, commonly known as the giant feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in the summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
