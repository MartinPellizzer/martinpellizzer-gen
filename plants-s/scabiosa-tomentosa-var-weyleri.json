    "intro": "Scabiosa tomentosa var. weyleri, commonly known as the woolly scabious, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fluffy appearance and long blooming period."
