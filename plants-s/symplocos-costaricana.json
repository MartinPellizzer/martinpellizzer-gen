It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in humid, shaded areas of tropical forests and is often found at low to mid-elevations. Symplocos costaricana is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
