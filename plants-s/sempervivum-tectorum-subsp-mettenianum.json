    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum subsp. mettenianum, commonly known as the Alpine Houseplant, is a succulent species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder, known as farina. The plant produces tall flowering stalks with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in cooler climates, though it may require protection in extreme winter conditions."
