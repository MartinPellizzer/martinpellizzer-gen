    "intro": "Spiraea rosea, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Spiraea rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
