    "intro": "Solidago squarrulosa, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The leaves are rough to the touch, hence the common name, and are typically lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
