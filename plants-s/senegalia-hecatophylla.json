    "intro": "Senegalia hecatophylla, commonly known as the yellow burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and spiny, compound leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, woody covering. It is often used for forage by livestock and has traditional uses in local medicine. Senegalia hecatophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
