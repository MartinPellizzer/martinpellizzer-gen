    "intro": "Solanum cardiophyllum var. amphixanthandrum, commonly known as the golden nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its striking yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that changes color as it ripens. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and has been cultivated for its vibrant floral display. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
