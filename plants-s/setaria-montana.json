    "intro": "Setaria montana, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to warm temperate and tropical regions and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spike-like inflorescence. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy crop for marginal agricultural lands. Its seeds are small, oval, and typically range in color from yellow to brown, and they are used for food, animal feed, and traditional medicine. Setaria montana is also valued for its ability to grow quickly and its role in soil conservation."
