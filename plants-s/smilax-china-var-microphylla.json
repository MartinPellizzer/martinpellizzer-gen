    "intro": "Smilax china var. microphylla, commonly known as Chinese smilax or small-leaved smilax, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features a woody stem covered in sharp, curved spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal umbels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
