    "intro": "Solanum rariflorum, commonly known as the rareflower nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum rariflorum is considered a rare and endangered species."
