    "intro": "Stelis pauxilla, commonly known as the Pauilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis pauxilla produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
