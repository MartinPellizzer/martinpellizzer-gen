    "intro": "Setaria pennicillata, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a grass species native to Africa and widely cultivated in Asia. It is a C4 plant, which allows it to efficiently perform photosynthesis under high temperatures and low water conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. It is drought-tolerant and has a short growing season, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its seeds are used for food, animal feed, and traditional medicine."
