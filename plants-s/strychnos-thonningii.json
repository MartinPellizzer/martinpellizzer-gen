    "intro": "Strychnos thonningii, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing small, dark brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. The species is notable for its toxic seeds, which contain strychnine, a potent alkaloid."
