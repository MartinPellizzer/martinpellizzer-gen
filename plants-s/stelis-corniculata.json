    "intro": "Stelis corniculata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique helmet-shaped structure on the labellum. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis corniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
