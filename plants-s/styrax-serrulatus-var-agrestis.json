    "intro": "Styrax serrulatus var. agrestis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed frangipani, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of fragrant, white, waxy flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have serrated margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is adapted to a variety of soil types, making it a versatile ornamental plant."
