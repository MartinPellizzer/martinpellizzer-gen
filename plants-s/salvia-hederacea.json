    "intro": "Salvia hederacea, commonly known as trailing sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and emit a strong mint-like fragrance when crushed. Salvia hederacea is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
