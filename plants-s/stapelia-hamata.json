    "intro": "Stapelia hamata, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and distinctive, fleshy, horn-like structures that give it its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Stapelia hamata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
