    "intro": "Silene graminifolia var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf catchfly, is a flowering plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is often densely packed, and the stems are usually prostrate or ascending, depending on environmental conditions. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Silene graminifolia."
