    "intro": "Saussurea dorogostaiskii, commonly known as the Tianshan saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tianshan Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces yellow to brown composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a single head at the top of the stem. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, arid conditions, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
