It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

Schistocarpha oppositifolia is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
