    "intro": "Stelis applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its flat, broad leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a delicate white or pale pink color. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Stelis applanata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique growth habit."
