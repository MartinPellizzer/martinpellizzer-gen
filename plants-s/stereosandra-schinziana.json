    "intro": "Stereosandra schinziana, commonly known as the Schinz's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in both horticulture and ecological studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
