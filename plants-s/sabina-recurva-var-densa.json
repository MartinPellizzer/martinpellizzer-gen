It features small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving the plant a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces blue-gray berries that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic foliage and winter interest."
