    "intro": "Salix paludosa, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Salix paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
