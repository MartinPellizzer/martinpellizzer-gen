    "intro": "Selaginella arenicola subsp. acanthonota, commonly known as the sand spikerush, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its spiky, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of dust or sand. This subspecies is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. It typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its reproduction in challenging environments."
