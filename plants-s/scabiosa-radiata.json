    "intro": "Scabiosa radiata, commonly known as the \"Cuckoo's Buttercup,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Caprifoliaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, daisy-like flowers with white petals surrounding a central cluster of pink or purple stamens. It produces small, rounded fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds by wind. Scabiosa radiata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
