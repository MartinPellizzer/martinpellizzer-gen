    "intro": "Sedum jacquemontii, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and is relatively low maintenance once established."
