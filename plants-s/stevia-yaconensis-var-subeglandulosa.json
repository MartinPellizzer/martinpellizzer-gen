    "intro": "Stevia yaconensis var. subeglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular yacon, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are tuberous and are the primary part used for its sweet, calorie-free properties. This variety is particularly noted for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, making it a valuable natural sweetener."
