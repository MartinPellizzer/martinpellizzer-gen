    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos seminudum, commonly known as the naked-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Africa. It features a slender, often leafless stem that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, typical of many orchid species. This orchid thrives in moist, well-drained habitats such as grasslands and forest margins."
