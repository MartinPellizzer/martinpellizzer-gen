    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wet habitats in Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue to purple flower spikes in early summer. The plant thrives in damp, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a clumping form that makes it suitable for wetland gardens. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
