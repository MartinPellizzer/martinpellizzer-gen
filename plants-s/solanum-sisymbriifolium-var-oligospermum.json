    "intro": "Solanum sisymbriifolium var. oligospermum, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, green to red berries containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
