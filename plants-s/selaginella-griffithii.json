    "intro": "Selaginella griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a rosette of upright, needle-like leaves and produces strobila (spore cones) at the tips of its stems. It is adapted to retain water and thrive in humid climates, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella griffithii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
