It typically grows in rocky, dry environments such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its tendency to form dense clusters of plants, giving it its common name."
