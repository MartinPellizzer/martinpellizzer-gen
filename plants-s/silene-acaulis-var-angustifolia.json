    "intro": "Silene acaulis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
