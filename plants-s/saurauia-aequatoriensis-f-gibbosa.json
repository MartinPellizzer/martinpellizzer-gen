    "intro": "Saurauia aequatoriensis f. gibbosa, commonly known as the warty saurauia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its unique, warty growth patterns on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is dense and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
