It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of cereal crops like maize and sorghum. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant agricultural damage. It is native to various regions in Africa and is a major pest in tropical and subtropical areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it poses a serious threat to food security in affected regions."
