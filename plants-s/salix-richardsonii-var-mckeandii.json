    "intro": "Salix richardsonii var. mckeandii, commonly known as the Mckeand's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often riparian environments. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence on the underside. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
