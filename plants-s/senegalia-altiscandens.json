    "intro": "Senegalia altiscandens, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and it is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Senegalia altiscandens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species."
