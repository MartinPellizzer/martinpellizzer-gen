    "intro": "Selaginella aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping stem that produces sporangia along its length. Native to the arid regions of Pakistan and India, it thrives in rocky and sandy soils with minimal water. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis. Its morphology and adaptations make it an important subject in the study of plant resilience and evolutionary biology."
