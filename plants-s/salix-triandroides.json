    "intro": "Salix triandroides, commonly known as the three-angled willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
