It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in maritime climates."
