    "intro": "Salix kimurana, commonly known as the Korean willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically gland-dotted. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Salix kimurana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
