    "intro": "Selaginella tenuifolia, commonly known as the 'spikemoss', is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized structures called stomata. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a moss-like appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Selaginella tenuifolia is also notable for its ability to reproduce through spores, which are released from cone-like structures called strobili."
