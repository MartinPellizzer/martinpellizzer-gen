It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Schinzafra gracilis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
