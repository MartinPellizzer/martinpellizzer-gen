    "intro": "Suaeda foliosa subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in dense clusters, and it produces small, spherical fruits. This subspecies is often found in the Mediterranean region and parts of the Middle East."
