    "intro": "Sabatia dodecandra var. kennedyana, commonly known as Kennedy's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is closely related to other species in the genus Sabatia, which are often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
