    "intro": "Specklinia carinifera, commonly known as the ridge-leafed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that often have a prominent midrib or ridge, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Specklinia carinifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and indoor spaces."
