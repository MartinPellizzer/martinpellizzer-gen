    "intro": "Selaginella pouzolziana var. philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
