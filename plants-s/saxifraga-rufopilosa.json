    "intro": "Saxifraga rufopilosa, commonly known as the red-haired saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, reddish-brown pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Saxifraga rufopilosa is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
