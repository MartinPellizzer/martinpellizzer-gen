    "intro": "Solanum namaquense, commonly known as the Namqua nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it has a woody stem that can become branched over time. Solanum namaquense is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important plants."
