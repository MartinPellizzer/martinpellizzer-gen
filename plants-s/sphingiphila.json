    "intro": "Sphingiphila, commonly known as the common sphingiphila, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sphingiphillaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and Mexico. Sphingiphila species often grow in moist, well-drained soils and are found in woodland or grassland habitats. They are pollinated primarily by moths and other nocturnal insects due to their evening-blooming nature."
