    "intro": "Stiburus alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly stiburus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and numerous stamens, making it visually striking. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by ants."
