    "intro": "Sedum atratum, commonly known as the darkleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, dark green leaves that are often tinged with purple or red. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum atratum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
