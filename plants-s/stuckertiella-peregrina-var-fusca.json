    "intro": "Stuckertiella peregrina var. fusca, commonly known as the dark-stemmed Stuckertiella, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often dark-colored stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
