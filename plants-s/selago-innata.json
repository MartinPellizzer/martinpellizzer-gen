    "intro": "Selago innata, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in its native habitat. Selago innata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
