    "intro": "Satyrium ferrugineum, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent red or orange markings on the petals and lip. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its growth is often associated with moist, shaded woodlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
