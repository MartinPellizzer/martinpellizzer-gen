    "intro": "Scleranthus stenodus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Scleranthus stenodus is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils, particularly in coastal or inland dunes."
