It typically grows in dense mats, spreading via rhizomes and stolons, and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
