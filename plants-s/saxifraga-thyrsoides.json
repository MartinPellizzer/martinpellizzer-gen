    "intro": "Saxifraga thyrsoides, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, clustered leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces upright, branched flowering stems that bear white or pinkish flowers in late summer. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and withstand harsh conditions. Saxifraga thyrsoides thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
