    "intro": "Stenostelma umbelluliferum, commonly known as the umbrella-leaved stenostelma, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, basal rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. The plant's distinctive appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
