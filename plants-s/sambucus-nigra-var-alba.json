    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. alba, commonly known as white elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, making it distinct from the more commonly known red elderberry. The plant produces small, white to yellow berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. White elderberry is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
