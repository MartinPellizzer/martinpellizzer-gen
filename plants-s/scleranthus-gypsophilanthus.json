    "intro": "Scleranthus gypsophilanthus, commonly known as the gypsum sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, often hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Scleranthus gypsophilanthus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
