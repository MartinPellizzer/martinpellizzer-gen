It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense heads and are known for their medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
