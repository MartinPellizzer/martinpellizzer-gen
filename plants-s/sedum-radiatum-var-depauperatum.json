    "intro": "Sedum radiatum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the sparseleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
