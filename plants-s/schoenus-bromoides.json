    "intro": "Schoenus bromoides, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Schoenus bromoides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
