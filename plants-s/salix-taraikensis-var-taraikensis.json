    "intro": "Salix taraikensis var. taraikensis, commonly known as the Taraikent willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks."
