    "intro": "Sanguisorba canadensis var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are broadly ovate with a wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. Its foliage is edible and has a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
