    "intro": "Salvia aucheri subsp. canescens, commonly known as woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to both garden and landscape designs. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, hairy leaves and its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
