    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea subsp. nudus, commonly known as the common ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are toxic to livestock and can cause liver damage. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its growth habit and chemical composition make it both ecologically significant and a potential agricultural concern."
