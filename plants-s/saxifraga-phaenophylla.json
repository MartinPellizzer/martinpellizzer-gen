    "intro": "Saxifraga phaenophylla, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Saxifraga phaenophylla is well adapted to its extreme habitat, showcasing remarkable resilience to low temperatures and strong winds."
