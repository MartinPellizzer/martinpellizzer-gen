    "intro": "Sommea calcitrapa, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, velvety grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their soothing properties. Sommea calcitrapa is adapted to thrive in poor, calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
