    "intro": "Saussurea borealis, commonly known as the Arctic saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saussurea borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in polar ecosystems and is a symbol of resilience in extreme climates."
