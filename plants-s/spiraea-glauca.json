    "intro": "Spiraea glauca, commonly known as the blueleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
