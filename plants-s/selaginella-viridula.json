    "intro": "Selaginella viridula, commonly known as the green spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are usually green and somewhat glossy. Selaginella viridula reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its presence is often indicative of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
