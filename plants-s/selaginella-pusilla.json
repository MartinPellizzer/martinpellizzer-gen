    "intro": "Selaginella pusilla, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. Selaginella pusilla is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks, where it forms dense mats. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on specialized branches and contain the spores necessary for its propagation."
