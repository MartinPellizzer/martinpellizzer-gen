    "intro": "Setaria viridis subvar. rufescens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a reddish tinge, especially at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
