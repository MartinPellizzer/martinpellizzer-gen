    "intro": "Stachys bracteata, commonly known as hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with purple or pink petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Stachys bracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
