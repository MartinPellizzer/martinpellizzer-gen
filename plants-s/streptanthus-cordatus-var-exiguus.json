    "intro": "Streptanthus cordatus var. exiguus, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Streptanthus cordatus."
