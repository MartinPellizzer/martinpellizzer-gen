It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by long, narrow pods that mature in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping, though it requires regular pruning to control its vigorous growth."
