    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus f. vestita, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are densely covered in fine, white trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its hirsute foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
