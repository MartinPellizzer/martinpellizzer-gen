    "intro": "Salix glaucescens, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a pale green upper surface and a silvery underside, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
