    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum subsp. decoloratum, commonly known as the red-silver sedum, is a low-growing, evergreen succulent native to the Alps. It features fleshy, basal leaves that are typically reddish or silver in color, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an easy-to-care-for plant for both novice and experienced gardeners."
