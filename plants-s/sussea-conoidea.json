    "intro": "Sussea conoidea, commonly known as the cone shell, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Trochidae. It is characterized by its spiral-shaped, calcareous shell that resembles a cone, often with a smooth or slightly ribbed surface. The plant-like structure of its shell is composed primarily of calcium carbonate, which provides structural support and protection. The species is typically found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, where it adheres to rocky substrates. Its shell exhibits a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple, depending on the species and environmental conditions."
