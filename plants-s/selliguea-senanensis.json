    "intro": "Selliguea senanensis, commonly known as the Malayan rock moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found on rocky substrates in humid tropical environments. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with a distinct upper and lower surface, and its leaves are closely arranged in a spiral pattern. It is often found in shaded, moist areas of forests and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Selliguea senanensis plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
