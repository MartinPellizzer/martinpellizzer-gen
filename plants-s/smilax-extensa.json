    "intro": "Smilax extensa, commonly known as the long-stemmed catbrier, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with spiny nodes and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. Smilax extensa is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be considered invasive in certain regions."
