    "intro": "Scilla hispanica, commonly known as Spanish squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its bulbs are toxic and have been used historically in folk medicine. Scilla hispanica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to naturalize in gardens."
