    "intro": "Syntherisma leucocoma, commonly known as the white lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a foliose lichen that forms a thin, crust-like thallus with a pale to white coloration. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal component. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces. Its structure and composition make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
