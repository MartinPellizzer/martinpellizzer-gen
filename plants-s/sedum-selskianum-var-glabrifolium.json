    "intro": "Sedum selskianum var. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid climates."
