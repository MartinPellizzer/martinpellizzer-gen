    "intro": "Salvia recurva, commonly known as the curlleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves that curl at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Salvia recurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
