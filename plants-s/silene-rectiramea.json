    "intro": "Silene rectiramea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf catchfly, is a species of flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Silene rectiramea is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
