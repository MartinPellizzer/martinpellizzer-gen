    "intro": "Saussurea yukiuenoana, commonly known as the Yukiuen's saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in alpine environments. It thrives in cold, moist conditions and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
