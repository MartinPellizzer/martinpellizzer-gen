    "intro": "Scrophularia scorodonia var. verticillata, commonly known as the purple marsh willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in damp soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged underside. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, forming a unique spiral arrangement, and are usually pale pink to purple in color. The species is noted for its adaptability to moist environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
