    "intro": "Stelis fons-stellarum, commonly known as the starlight orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less hospitable conditions. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often have a unique star-like appearance, hence its common name. Stelis fons-stellarum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
