    "intro": "Sempervivum sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are thick and covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks with small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Sempervivum sosnowskyi is also known for its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments."
