    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos sancti-antonii, commonly known as the San Antonio ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent green leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival."
