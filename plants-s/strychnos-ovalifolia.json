    "intro": "Strychnos ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf strychnos, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves contain toxic alkaloids, which have been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal or ritual purposes. However, due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated or used in modern horticulture."
