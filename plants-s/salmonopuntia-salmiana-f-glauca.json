    "intro": "Salmonopuntia salmiana f. glauca, commonly known as the blue-leafed cactus, is a unique cultivar of the Salmonopuntia genus. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, an adaptation to arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
