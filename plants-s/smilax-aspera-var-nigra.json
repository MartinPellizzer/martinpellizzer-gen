    "intro": "Smilax aspera var. nigra, commonly known as blackberry nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dark purple to black berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be handled with care. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades."
