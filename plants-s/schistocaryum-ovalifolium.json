    "intro": "Schistocaryum ovalifolium, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, leathery fruits that turn red when mature. Schistocaryum ovalifolium is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
