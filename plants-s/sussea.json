    "intro": "Sussea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually broad and succulent, helping the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. Sussea species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance and resilience."
