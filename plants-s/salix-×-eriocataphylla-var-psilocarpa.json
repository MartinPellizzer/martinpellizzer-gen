    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 eriocataphylla var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the red-osier dogwood, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive, bright red twigs that stand out against its green foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to North America, often found in wetlands and along stream banks where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind, followed by small, round berries that are an important food source for birds. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
