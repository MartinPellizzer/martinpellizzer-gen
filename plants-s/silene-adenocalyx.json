    "intro": "Silene adenocalyx, commonly known as the woolly bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky soils. Silene adenocalyx is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
