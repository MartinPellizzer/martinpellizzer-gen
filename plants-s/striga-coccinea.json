    "intro": "Striga coccinea, commonly known as the red witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and cereal crops. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rapid growth and ability to cause significant yield losses in agricultural crops make it a major weed in tropical and subtropical regions. Striga coccinea is also notable for its complex life cycle, which involves seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host plants."
