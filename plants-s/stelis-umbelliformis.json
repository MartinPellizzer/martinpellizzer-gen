    "intro": "Stelis umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to store moisture. The flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in summer and are arranged in an umbellate fashion, giving the plant its common name."
