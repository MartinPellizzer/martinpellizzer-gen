    "intro": "Silene foetida subsp. herminii, commonly known as the stinking roselin. This subspecies is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China and the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a notable feature, likely serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
