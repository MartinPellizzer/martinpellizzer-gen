    "intro": "Sambucus nigra filifolia, commonly known as the European elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have fine, thread-like veins, giving it the species name *filifolia*. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils."
