    "intro": "Spiranthes lanceolata var. paludicola, commonly known as the swamp twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in bogs or along the edges of ponds and lakes. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
