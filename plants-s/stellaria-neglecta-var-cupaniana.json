    "intro": "Stellaria neglecta var. cupaniana, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base, and its stems are prostrate, spreading along the ground. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is notable for its ability to self-seed readily, contributing to its widespread distribution."
