It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its leaf-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dense forests where it can access suitable host species. Its ecological role includes providing food for certain birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
