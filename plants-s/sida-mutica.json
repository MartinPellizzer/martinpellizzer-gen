    "intro": "Sida mutica, commonly known as sticky sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sida mutica is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across different habitats."
