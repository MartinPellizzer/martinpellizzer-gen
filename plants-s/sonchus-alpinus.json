    "intro": "Sonchus alpinus, commonly known as alpine sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by achene fruits. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
