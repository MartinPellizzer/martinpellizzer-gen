    "intro": "Sisymbrianthus palustris, commonly known as the marsh shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with distinctive triangular seed pods that resemble a shepherd's purse. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species for wetland ecosystems."
