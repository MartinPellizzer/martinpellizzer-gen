    "intro": "Sphaeropuntia sphaerica subsp. tumida, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, ribbed, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
