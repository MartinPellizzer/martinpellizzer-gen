    "intro": "Scirpus wilkensii, commonly known as the Wilkens' bulrush, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in shallow water or damp soil. Scirpus wilkensii plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
