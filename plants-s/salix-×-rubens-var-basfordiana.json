    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rubens var. basfordiana, commonly known as the Basford weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near waterways, making it well-suited for riparian habitats. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing stream banks."
