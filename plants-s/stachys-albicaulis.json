    "intro": "Stachys albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Stachys albicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
