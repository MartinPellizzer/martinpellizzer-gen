It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in wetland or swampy environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically brown or reddish in color. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
