    "intro": "Salvia arbuscula, commonly known as the tree sage, is a shrub-like perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems that resemble small trees, hence its common name. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Salvia arbuscula is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
