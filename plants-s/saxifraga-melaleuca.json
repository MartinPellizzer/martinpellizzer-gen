    "intro": "Saxifraga melaleuca, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Saxifraga melaleuca is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy and resilient species."
