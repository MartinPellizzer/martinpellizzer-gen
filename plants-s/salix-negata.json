    "intro": "Salix negata, commonly known as the red-osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems that become more prominent in winter. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and along roadsides. Salix negata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
