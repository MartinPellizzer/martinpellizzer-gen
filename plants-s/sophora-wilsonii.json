    "intro": "Sophora wilsonii, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces striking racemes of violet-blue or white flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. Sophora wilsonii has nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
