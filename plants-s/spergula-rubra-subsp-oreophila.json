    "intro": "Spergula rubra subsp. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain spleenwort, is a rare and specialized moss found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, often reddish-brown stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded rock crevices and soil, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct midrib and a smooth, glossy surface. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
