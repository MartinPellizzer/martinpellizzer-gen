    "intro": "Salix pinetorum, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green color during the growing season. It produces catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are important for pollination. The tree is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
