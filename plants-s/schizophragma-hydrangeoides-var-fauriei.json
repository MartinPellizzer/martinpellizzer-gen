    "intro": "Schizophragma hydrangeoides var. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's hydrangea vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to China. It is characterized by its lush, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by ornamental, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or walls."
