    "intro": "Schismatoglottis hendrikii, commonly known as the Hendrik's schismatoglottis, is a rare and attractive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it typically grows as an epiphyte on trees. The plant features dark green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in a spike with pale green or white petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
