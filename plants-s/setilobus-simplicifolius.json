    "intro": "Setilobus simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leafed setilobus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in its harsh environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
