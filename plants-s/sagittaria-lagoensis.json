    "intro": "Sagittaria lagoensis, commonly known as the marsh arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow water environments. It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are narrow and ribbon-like. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water. It thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and pond margins. Sagittaria lagoensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
