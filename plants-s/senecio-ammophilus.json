    "intro": "Senecio ammophilus, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid environments. Senecio ammophilus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
