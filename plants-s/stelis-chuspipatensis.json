    "intro": "Stelis chuspipatensis, commonly known as the Chuspipata orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Ecuador and Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base and are characterized by their smooth, waxy texture. Stelis chuspipatensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
