    "intro": "Sponia orientalis var. affinis, commonly known as the Eastern Sponia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, velvety foliage that turns a striking silver-green in autumn. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and lavender, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
