    "intro": "Scrophularia schousboei subsp. montana, commonly known as the Montana scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae, which includes many species with similar morphological traits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
