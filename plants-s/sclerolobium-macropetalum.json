    "intro": "Sclerolobium macropetalum, commonly known as the African broom, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, often thorny foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces woody pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
