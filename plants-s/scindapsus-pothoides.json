    "intro": "Scindapsus pothoides, commonly known as the silver vine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or pale green powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Scindapsus pothoides is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
