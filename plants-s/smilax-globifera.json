    "intro": "Smilax globifera, commonly known as the globeflower smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, recurved spines along its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Smilax globifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant member of the Smilacaceae family."
