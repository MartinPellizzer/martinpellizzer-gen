    "intro": "Senecio bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
