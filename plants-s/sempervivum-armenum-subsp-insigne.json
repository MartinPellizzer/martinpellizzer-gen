    "intro": "Sempervivum armenum subsp. insigne, commonly known as the Armenian houseleek, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountains of Armenia and surrounding regions. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces tall flowering stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. This subspecies is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
