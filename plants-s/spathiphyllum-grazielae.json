    "intro": "Spathiphyllum grazielae, commonly known as the Grazielae peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Philippines. It features broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and upright. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering. Its air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for both ornamental and environmental purposes."
