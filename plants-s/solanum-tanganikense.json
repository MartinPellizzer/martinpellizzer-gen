    "intro": "Solanum tanganikense, commonly known as Lake Tanganyika nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the eastern African region, particularly around Lake Tanganyika. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Solanum tanganikense is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
