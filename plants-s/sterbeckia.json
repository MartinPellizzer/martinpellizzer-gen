It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plants typically have showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pink petals, which bloom throughout the year. Sterbeckia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their vibrant and long-lasting blooms. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun, making them relatively easy to grow in suitable climates."
