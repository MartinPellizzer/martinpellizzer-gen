    "intro": "Symphoricarpos racemosus var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features white and green patterns on the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and mammals but are toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
