    "intro": "Selaginella ramosissima, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features branching stems covered with scale-like leaves, and it produces spores in structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella ramosissima is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
