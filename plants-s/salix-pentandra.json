    "intro": "Salix pentandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Salix pentandra is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges."
