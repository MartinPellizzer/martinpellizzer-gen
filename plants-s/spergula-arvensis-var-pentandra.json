    "intro": "Spergula arvensis var. pentandra, commonly known as five-ribbed mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is distinguished by its five prominent ribs on the leaves, which give it its common name."
