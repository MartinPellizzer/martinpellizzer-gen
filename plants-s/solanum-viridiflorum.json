    "intro": "Solanum viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture. It produces berries that start green and mature to a dark blue or black color. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
