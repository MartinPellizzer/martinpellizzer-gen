    "intro": "Spiraea expansa f. incisoserrata, commonly known as the cut-leaved weeping spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features horizontal stems that arch gracefully, creating a weeping appearance, and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with finely toothed margins that give it a distinctive, delicate look. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. This variety is hardy, adaptable, and suitable for use as a hedge or in mixed borders."
