    "intro": "Spermolepis patens, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a bulbous stem and produces narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are typically borne on a tall, erect stem and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Spermolepis patens is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments."
