    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ardana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is a natural hybrid between Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix phylicifolia (red osier dogwood). The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its showy, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Salix \u00d7 ardana is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
