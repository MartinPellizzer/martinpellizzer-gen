    "intro": "Stemonoporus, commonly known as the golden lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble lilies, though they are not closely related to true lilies. Stemonoporus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests. The leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and the plants often have a short stem with a cluster of flowers at the top. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to forest biodiversity."
