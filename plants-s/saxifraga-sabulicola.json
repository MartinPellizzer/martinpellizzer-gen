    "intro": "Saxifraga sabulicola, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in rocky or coastal environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga sabulicola is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
