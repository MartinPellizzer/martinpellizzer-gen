    "intro": "Sporobolus pulvinatus, commonly known as the bullseagrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a trait that contributes to its adaptability in arid and semi-arid environments. Sporobolus pulvinatus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an important species in ecological restoration projects."
