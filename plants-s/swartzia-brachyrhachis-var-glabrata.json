    "intro": "Swartzia brachyrhachis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed swartzia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Leguminosae. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and pinnately compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing rounded seeds. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
