It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with trifoliate leaves that have a finely divided, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Sceptridium ternatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
