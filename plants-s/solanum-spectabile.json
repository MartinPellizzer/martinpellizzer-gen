    "intro": "Solanum spectabile, commonly known as the showy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, like many plants in the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
