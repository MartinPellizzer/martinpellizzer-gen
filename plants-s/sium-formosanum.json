It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream sides and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the family, and it produces a long, slender root that is sometimes used in traditional medicine.
