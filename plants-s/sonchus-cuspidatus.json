    "intro": "Sonchus cuspidatus, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows up to 1 meter tall and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
