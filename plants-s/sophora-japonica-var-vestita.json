    "intro": "Sophora japonica var. vestita, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree or the white-flowered silk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a long, flat pod that splits open to release seeds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
