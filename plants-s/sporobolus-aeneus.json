    "intro": "Sporobolus aeneus, commonly known as silverleaf grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Silverleaf grama is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
