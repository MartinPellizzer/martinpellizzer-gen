It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in a dense, upright cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies.
