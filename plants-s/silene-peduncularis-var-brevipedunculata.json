    "intro": "Silene peduncularis var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed catchfly, is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and dunes. This variant is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form of Silene peduncularis."
