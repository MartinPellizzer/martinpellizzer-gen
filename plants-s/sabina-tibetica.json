    "intro": "Sabina tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and aromatic wood. The plant typically forms dense thickets and is adapted to harsh, cold climates with poor soil conditions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sabina tibetica is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
