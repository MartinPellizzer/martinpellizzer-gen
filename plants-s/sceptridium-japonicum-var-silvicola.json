    "intro": "Sceptridium japonicum var. silvicola, commonly known as the Japanese false grass, is a rare and delicate fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
