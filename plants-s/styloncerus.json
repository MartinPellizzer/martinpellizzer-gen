    "intro": "Styloncerus, commonly known as the long-horned beetle, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Cerambycidae. These insects are characterized by their elongated bodies and prominent antennae, which are often longer than their body length. They are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they inhabit a variety of forested environments. The larvae of Styloncerus species typically feed on dead or decaying wood, playing a role in the decomposition process. Their presence is often an indicator of healthy, mature woodlands due to their preference for specific host plants."
