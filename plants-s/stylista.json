It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence called a cyme, which typically blooms in early spring. Stylista has a fibrous root system and is often found in shaded, moist woodland habitats. It is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
