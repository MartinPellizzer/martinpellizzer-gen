    "intro": "Smilax caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Smilax caroliniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
