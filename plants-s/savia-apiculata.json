    "intro": "Savia apiculata, commonly known as the mountain balm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in loose inflorescences. It is known for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Savia apiculata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
