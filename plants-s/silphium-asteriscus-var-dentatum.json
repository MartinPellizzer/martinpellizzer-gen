    "intro": "Silphium asteriscus var. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height, bearing opposite, toothed leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in a composite head, which are typically arranged in a single, terminal cluster. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its historical use by Native Americans and its rarity in the wild, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in some regions."
