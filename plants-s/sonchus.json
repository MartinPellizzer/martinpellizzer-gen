    "intro": "Sonchus, commonly known as sowthistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems, toothed leaves, and yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. They are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to their rapid growth and adaptability. Some species are considered weeds, while others are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which have been studied for their ecological and agricultural impacts."
