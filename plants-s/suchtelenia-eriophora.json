    "intro": "Suchtelenia eriophora, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round fruits known as siliques. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
