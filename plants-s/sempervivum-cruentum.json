    "intro": "Sempervivum cruentum, commonly known as the crimson rosette plant, is a succulent species native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically red or purple in color, especially when exposed to full sun. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces upright, branching flower stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. This hardy plant is well adapted to rocky, alpine environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
