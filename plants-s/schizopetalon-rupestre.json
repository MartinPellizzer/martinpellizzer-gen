    "intro": "Schizopetalon rupestre, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Schizopetalon rupestre is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
