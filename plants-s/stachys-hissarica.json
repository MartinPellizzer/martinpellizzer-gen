    "intro": "Stachys hissarica, commonly known as the Armenian betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features erect, square stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces spikes of violet or purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stachys hissarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
