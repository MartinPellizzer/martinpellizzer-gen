    "intro": "Sulettaria kandariensis, commonly known as the Kandari sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid environment. Sulettaria kandariensis is well-suited to coastal conditions and is often found in dune ecosystems."
