    "intro": "Sorbus sarcocarpa, commonly known as the blackthorn or sloe, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible, although tart, berries in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is often used in hedgerows and for its ornamental value, as well as for the production of sloe gin."
