    "intro": "Sarcanthus cerinus, commonly known as the golden thread, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the plant. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is known for its delicate, feathery appearance. Native to regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
