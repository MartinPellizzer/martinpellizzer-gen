    "intro": "Sorbus cinereopubescens, commonly known as the ash-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical, ash-like leaves that are densely covered with fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
