    "intro": "Solanum nummularium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, round, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Following flowering, it develops bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum nummularium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
