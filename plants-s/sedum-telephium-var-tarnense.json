    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. tarnense, commonly known as the Tarnense stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems that produce clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
