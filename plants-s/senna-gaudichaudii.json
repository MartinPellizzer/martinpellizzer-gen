    "intro": "Senna gaudichaudii, commonly known as the golden senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and the plant can grow as a shrub or small tree. Senna gaudichaudii is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
