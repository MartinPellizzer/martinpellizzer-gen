    "intro": "Syringa vulgaris var. pulchella, commonly known as the late flowering lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other lilac varieties, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are dark green and velvety in texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy floral display and adaptability to various growing conditions."
