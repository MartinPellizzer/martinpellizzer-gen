    "intro": "Stomatium ronaldii, commonly known as the Ronaldii's mouth plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a specialized structure called a stomatium, which is a modified leaf that functions as a trap for small insects. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vivid colors that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Stomatium ronaldii is considered a vulnerable species."
