It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping clusters of small white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution. Its leaves are compound, with three to five ovate leaflets, and the plant often has a reddish-brown bark. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
