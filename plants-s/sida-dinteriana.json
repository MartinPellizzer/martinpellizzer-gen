    "intro": "Sida dinteriana, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its slender, often twisted branches. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sida dinteriana is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
