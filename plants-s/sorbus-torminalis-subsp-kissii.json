    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis subsp. kissii, commonly known as the Blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorned branches and small, black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. The species is notable for its ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects, and its ornamental value in gardens."
