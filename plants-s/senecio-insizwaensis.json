It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
