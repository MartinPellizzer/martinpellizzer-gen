    "intro": "Sedum praealtum, commonly known as the tall sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, including harsh alpine environments."
