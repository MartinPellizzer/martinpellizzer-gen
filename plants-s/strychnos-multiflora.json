    "intro": "Strychnos multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered strychnos, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine despite their harmful properties. Strychnos multiflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of caution due to its toxic nature."
