    "intro": "Spiraea purpurea, commonly known as the rose willow or redleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The foliage turns a striking red or orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to the plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its compact size and showy flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental hedges and borders."
