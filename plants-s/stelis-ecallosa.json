    "intro": "Stelis ecallosa, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine, hairy structures that help retain moisture. Stelis ecallosa is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to shaded environments."
