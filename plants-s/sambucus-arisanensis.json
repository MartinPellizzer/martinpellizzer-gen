    "intro": "Sambucus arisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, though they are generally not as widely cultivated as other elderberry species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
