It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a fuzzy texture."
