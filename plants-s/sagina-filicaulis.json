    "intro": "Sagina filicaulis, commonly known as the common carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
