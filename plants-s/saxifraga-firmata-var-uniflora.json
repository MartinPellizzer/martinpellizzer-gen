    "intro": "Saxifraga firmata var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower per stem, which blooms in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Saxifraga firmata var. uniflora is often found in alpine tundra and is a hardy species that can withstand extreme environmental conditions."
