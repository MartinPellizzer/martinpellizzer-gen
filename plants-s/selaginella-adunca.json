    "intro": "Selaginella adunca, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and upright, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Selaginella adunca is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
