    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana var. tateyamensis, commonly known as the Tateyama saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
