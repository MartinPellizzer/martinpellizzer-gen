    "intro": "Selago laticorymbosa, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and creeping. Selago laticorymbosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
