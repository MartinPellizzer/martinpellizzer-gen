    "intro": "Shangrilaia nana, commonly known as the dwarf shangrila lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink, typically in late spring. The plant grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed at the base. Shangrilaia nana prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, thriving in cool, humid climates."
