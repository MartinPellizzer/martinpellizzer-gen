    "intro": "Saxifraga lyallii subsp. hultenii, commonly known as the Hult\u00e9n's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
