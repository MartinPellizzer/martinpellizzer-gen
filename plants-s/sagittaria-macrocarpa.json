    "intro": "Sagittaria macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruit arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, narrow stems that often extend into shallow water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. Its roots help stabilize sediment in aquatic environments, contributing to water clarity. Sagittaria macrocarpa is also an important food source for various waterfowl and aquatic invertebrates."
