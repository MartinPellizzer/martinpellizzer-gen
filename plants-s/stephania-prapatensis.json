    "intro": "Stephania prapatensis, commonly known as the Prapat stephania, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand. It belongs to the Menispermaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red berry, which is an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
