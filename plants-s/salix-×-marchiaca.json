    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 marchiaca, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub that exhibits striking ornamental features. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix viminalis (osier willow), resulting in a plant with cascading branches and delicate leaves. The species is characterized by its flexible, drooping branches that create a flowing, willow-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
