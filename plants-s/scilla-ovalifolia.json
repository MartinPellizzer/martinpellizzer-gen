    "intro": "Scilla ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval leaf scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in woodland margins and rocky soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive harsh winters. Scilla ovalifolia is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and early blooming habit."
