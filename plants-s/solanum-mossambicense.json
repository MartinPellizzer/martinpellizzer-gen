    "intro": "Solanum mossambicense, commonly known as the Mozambique nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Solanum mossambicense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by both livestock and humans."
