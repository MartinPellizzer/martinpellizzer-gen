    "intro": "Senecio productus subsp. magnus, commonly known as the giant candleplant, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, woolly white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers at the tips of its stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
