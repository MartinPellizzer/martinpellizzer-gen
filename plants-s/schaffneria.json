It consists of two species, Schaffneria corymbosa and Schaffneria scabrida, both native to South America. These plants are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their delicate appearance. Schaffneria prefers moist, shady environments and is typically found in forest understories."
