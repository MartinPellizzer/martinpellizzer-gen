It is characterized by its pink to purple flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tubular with five reflexed lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
