    "intro": "Satureja montana subsp. innota, commonly known as alpine savory, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and spikes of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their pungent, thyme-like fragrance. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Satureja montana."
