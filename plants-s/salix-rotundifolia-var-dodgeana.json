It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are rounded at the tip, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as along streams, lakes, and wetlands. Its catkins are a key feature, with male and female flowers appearing on separate shoots. The species is valued for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
