    "intro": "Sedum anglicum, commonly known as English stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or containers. Sedum anglicum is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators."
