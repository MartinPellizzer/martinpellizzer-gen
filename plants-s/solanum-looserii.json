    "intro": "Solanum looserii, commonly known as the Looser's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, lowland areas. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
