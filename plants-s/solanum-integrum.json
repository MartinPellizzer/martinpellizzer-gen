    "intro": "Solanum integrum, commonly known as the purple potato or wild potato, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by round, tuberous fruits. Its tubers, which are edible, have a purple skin and a starchy, slightly sweet flavor. Solanum integrum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
