    "intro": "Smelowskia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Smelowskia tibetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
