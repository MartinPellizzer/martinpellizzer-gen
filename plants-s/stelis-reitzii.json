    "intro": "Stelis reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctively shaped lip. Its growth habit involves forming pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Stelis reitzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
