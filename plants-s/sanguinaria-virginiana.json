    "intro": "Sanguinaria virginiana, commonly known as bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a single, waxy, reddish-brown rhizome that gives the plant its common name. The plant has a basal cluster of dark green, palmately lobed leaves and produces solitary, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. Bloodroot is characterized by its distinctive red sap, which is toxic and has been used historically by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, organic soils."
