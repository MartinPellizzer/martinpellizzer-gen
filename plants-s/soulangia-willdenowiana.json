    "intro": "Soulangia willdenowiana, commonly known as the willdenow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is often found in swampy areas and can be an indicator species for wetland ecosystems. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
