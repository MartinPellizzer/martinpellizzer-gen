    "intro": "Semenovia pulvinata, commonly known as the pulvinate saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in a single cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
