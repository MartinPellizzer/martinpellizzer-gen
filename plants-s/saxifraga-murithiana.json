    "intro": "Saxifraga murithiana, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its arid habitat. Saxifraga murithiana is often found in mountainous areas of Switzerland, Austria, and Italy."
