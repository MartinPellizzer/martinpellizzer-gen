    "intro": "Sonchus sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's weed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
