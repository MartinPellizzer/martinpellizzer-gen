    "intro": "Sempervivum arachnoideum subsp. doellianum, commonly known as the Woolly Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white, woolly coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. This subspecies is relatively low maintenance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
