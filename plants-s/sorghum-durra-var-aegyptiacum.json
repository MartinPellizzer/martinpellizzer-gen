    "intro": "Sorghum durra var. aegyptiacum, commonly known as Egyptian durra, is a tall, annual grass native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its robust stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous grains. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water, making it a resilient crop in challenging environments. Its grains are used for food, animal feed, and even as a source of biofuel. The plant's deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure in agricultural settings."
