    "intro": "[WRONG START] S-tevia conferta var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy leaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the genus Stevia. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. This variety is often cultivated for its medicinal and culinary uses due to its intense sweetness and low caloric content."
