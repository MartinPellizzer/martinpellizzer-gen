    "intro": "Stelis fulva, commonly known as the golden stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and sepals, and a contrasting orange lip. Stelis fulva is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
