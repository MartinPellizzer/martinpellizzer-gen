    "intro": "Sylphia cactantha, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a tall, spindly stem with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sylphia cactantha is valued for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements in xeriscaping."
