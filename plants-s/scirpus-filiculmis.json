    "intro": "Scirpus filiculmis, commonly known as the feather-tongue sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats. Scirpus filiculmis plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
