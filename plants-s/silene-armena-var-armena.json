It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
