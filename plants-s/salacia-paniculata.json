    "intro": "Salacia paniculata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of yellow flowers that resemble cascading showers, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is not closely related to them. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Salacia paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
