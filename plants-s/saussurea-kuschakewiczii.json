    "intro": "Saussurea kuschakewiczii, commonly known as the Kuschakewicz's saffron, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of yellowish to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is notable for its medicinal properties, which have been traditionally used in local herbal remedies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
