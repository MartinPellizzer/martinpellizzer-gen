    "intro": "Schoenus caricoides, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in swampy forests, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three rows, characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its small, clustered flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces distinctive, three-sided seed capsules. Schoenus caricoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
