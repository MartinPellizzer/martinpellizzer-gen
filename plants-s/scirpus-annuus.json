    "intro": "Scirpus annuus, commonly known as common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming in summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic or marshy habitats. Scirpus annuus is widely used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
