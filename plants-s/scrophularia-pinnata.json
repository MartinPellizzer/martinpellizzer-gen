    "intro": "Scrophularia pinnata, commonly known as the heart-leaved figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Scrophularia pinnata is often found in the wild but can be cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
