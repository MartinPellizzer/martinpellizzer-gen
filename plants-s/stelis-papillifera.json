    "intro": "Stelis papillifera, commonly known as the hairy stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Stelis papillifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
