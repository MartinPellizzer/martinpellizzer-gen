It typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance through deep root systems. Scutachne species are often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, contributing to soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological and agricultural systems in its native habitats."
