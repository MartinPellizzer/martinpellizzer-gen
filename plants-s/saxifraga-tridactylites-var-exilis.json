    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites var. exilis, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia."
