    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum rufilanceolatum, commonly known as the red-bracted sciodaphyllum, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
