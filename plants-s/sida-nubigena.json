It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in coastal or disturbed areas. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.
