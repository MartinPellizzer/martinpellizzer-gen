    "intro": "Styphelia carstensensis, commonly known as the Carstens' wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal areas of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. Styphelia carstensensis is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which emit a subtle, minty scent when crushed."
