    "intro": "Scirpus equitans, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of brown, spadix-like flowers that are often covered in a white or pale green spathe. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually stiff and fibrous, growing from a rhizomatous root system. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Scirpus equitans plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
