    "intro": "Solanum schroederi, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6der's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its fruit is a toxic, fleshy berry that contains alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its poisonous nature."
