    "intro": "Scirpus subulatus var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape sedge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
