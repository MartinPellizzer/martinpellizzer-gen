    "intro": "Stipa vatroensis, commonly known as the Vatro's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Stipa vatroensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
