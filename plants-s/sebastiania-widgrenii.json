    "intro": "Sebastiania widgrenii, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
