    "intro": "Sida texana, commonly known as Texas mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a shrub or subshrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are ovate with a rough texture. Sida texana has a fibrous root system and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility."
