    "intro": "Sida micrantha, commonly known as small-flowered sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Sida micrantha is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
