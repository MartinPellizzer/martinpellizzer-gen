    "intro": "Serapias nurrica f. chlorantha, commonly known as the green-flowered sand orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its vibrant greenish-yellow flowers, which contrast with its deep green foliage. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
