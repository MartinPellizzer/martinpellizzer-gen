    "intro": "Solanum lasiocarpum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
