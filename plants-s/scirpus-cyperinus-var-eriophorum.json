    "intro": "Scirpus cyperinus var. eriophorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize shorelines, making it an important species for wetland restoration. The narrow, grass-like leaves are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance."
