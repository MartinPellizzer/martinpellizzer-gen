    "intro": "Symphyotrichum fontinale, commonly known as the woodland aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features showy purple to pinkish-blue flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually hairy as well. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
