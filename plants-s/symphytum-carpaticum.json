It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall, spiky flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is known for its robust growth and adaptability to various soil conditions. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. However, due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
