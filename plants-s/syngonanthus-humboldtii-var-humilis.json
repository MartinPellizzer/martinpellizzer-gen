    "intro": "Syngonanthus humboldtii var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
