    "intro": "Salix sarmatica, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, and it is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is adapted to harsh climates and can thrive in areas with limited nutrients. Salix sarmatica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
