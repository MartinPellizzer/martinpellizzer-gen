    "intro": "Solanum marojejy, commonly known as the Marojejy nightshade, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Marojejy Mountains of northeastern Madagascar. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, simple leaves, and small, star-shaped white or yellow flowers. Solanum marojejy produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature, containing small, hard seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
