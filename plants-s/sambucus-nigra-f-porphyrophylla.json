It is a subspecies of the common elderberry, known for its showy, clusters of small white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces its distinctive red berries in late summer, which remain on the shrub well into winter, adding visual interest. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively hardy, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. The berries, while attractive, are toxic and should not be consumed by humans or livestock."
