    "intro": "Scirpus glaucovirens, commonly known as the silver rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-brown flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically ranging from 30 to 100 centimeters in length. Scirpus glaucovirens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
