    "intro": "Silene salmonacea, commonly known as the salmon pink, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Silene salmonacea plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
