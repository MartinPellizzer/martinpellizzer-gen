    "intro": "Schiekia timida, commonly known as the timid schiekia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green to reddish leaves. Schiekia timida produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
