    "intro": "Stelis mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake. Stelis mirabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
