It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, ray florets, giving it a striking appearance in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, disk-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
