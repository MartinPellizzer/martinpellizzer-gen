    "intro": "Scaevola parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered fanflower, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Australia. It features compact, rounded foliage and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. Scaevola parviflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
