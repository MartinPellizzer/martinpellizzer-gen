    "intro": "Selaginella involvens f. minor, commonly known as the lesser spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. It features delicate, spirally arranged leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
