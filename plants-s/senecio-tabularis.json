    "intro": "Senecio tabularis, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
