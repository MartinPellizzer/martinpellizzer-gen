    "intro": "Stemodia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered stemodia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stem. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and geographic distribution."
