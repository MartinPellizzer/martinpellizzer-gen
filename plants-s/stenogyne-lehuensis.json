It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and streamside areas. It has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
