    "intro": "Steironema ciliatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Steironema ciliatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
