    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos hispiduliformis var. vinkii, commonly known as the Vink's spiky stephanos, is a rare and unusual member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence and hairy foliage, which give it a distinctive appearance. Native to a limited geographic region, this plant thrives in specific microhabitats with well-drained soils. Its small, white flowers are typically arranged in spherical clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
