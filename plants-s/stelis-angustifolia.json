    "intro": "Stelis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis angustifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
