    "intro": "Satyrium aureum, commonly known as the golden twayblade, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that produces a single, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it is known for its subtle, delicate appearance. Satyrium aureum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
