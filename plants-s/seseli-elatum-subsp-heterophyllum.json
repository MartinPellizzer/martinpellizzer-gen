    "intro": "Seseli elatum subsp. heterophyllum, commonly known as the mountain sesame, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
