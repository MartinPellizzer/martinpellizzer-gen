    "intro": "Stellaria monantha var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often hairy. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. This variant is closely related to other Stellaria species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different floral characteristics."
