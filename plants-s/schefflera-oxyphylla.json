It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for native wildlife. Schefflera oxyphylla thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
