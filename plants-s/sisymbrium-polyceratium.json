It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
