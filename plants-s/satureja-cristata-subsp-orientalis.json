    "intro": "Satureja cristata subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental mountain savory, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and cuisine for its pungent, slightly minty scent. The subspecies orientalis is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the nominate form."
