    "intro": "Stisseria glanduliflora, commonly known as the glandular-flowered stisseria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are often covered in glandular structures, which may play a role in attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stisseria glanduliflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
