    "intro": "Simaba africana, commonly known as African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange-red drupes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in furniture making, though it is also threatened by overharvesting."
