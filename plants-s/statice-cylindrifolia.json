    "intro": "Statice cylindrifolia, commonly known as the cylindrical sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its narrow leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Statice cylindrifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
