    "intro": "Sisymbrium runcinatum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy wild radish, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields, and is considered an annual herb. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
