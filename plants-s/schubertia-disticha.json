    "intro": "Schubertia disticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It features small, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Schubertia disticha is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats."
