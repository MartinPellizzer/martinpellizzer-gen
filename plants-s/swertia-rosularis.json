    "intro": "Swertia rosularis, commonly known as the Rosular Swertia, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Swertia rosularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
