    "intro": "Stathmostelma incarnatum, commonly known as the red-flowered stathmostelma, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and unique, clustered inflorescence. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a glossy surface that reflects light. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
