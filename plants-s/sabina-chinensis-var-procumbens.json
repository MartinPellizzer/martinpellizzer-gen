    "intro": "Sabina chinensis var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that give way to blue-black berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valued plant in horticulture."
