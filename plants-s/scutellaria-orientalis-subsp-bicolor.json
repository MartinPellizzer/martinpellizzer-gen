    "intro": "Scutellaria orientalis subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored skullcap, is a perennial herb native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, a characteristic feature of the Scutellariaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its bicoloration, with the upper lip of the flower being a different hue from the lower lip."
