It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, angular leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky areas or along streambanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
