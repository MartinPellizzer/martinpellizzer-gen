    "intro": "Scrophularia micrantha, commonly known as narrow-leaved figwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Scrophularia micrantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
