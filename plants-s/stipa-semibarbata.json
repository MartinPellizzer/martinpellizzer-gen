    "intro": "Stipa semibarbata, commonly known as the semi-barbed grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
