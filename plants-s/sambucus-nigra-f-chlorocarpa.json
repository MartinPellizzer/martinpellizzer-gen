    "intro": "Sambucus nigra f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-fruited elderberry, is a botanical variant of the common elderberry. It is characterized by its distinctive green berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter, unlike the typical red or black berries of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 2 to 6 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental features and extended fruiting period."
