    "intro": "Salvia pachyphylla subsp. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources."
