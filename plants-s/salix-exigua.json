    "intro": "Salix exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix exigua thrives in moist environments, such as streambanks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in riparian habitats."
