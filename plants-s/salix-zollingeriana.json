    "intro": "Salix zollingeriana, commonly known as Zollinger's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
