    "intro": "Sebastiania membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous-sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in countries like Mexico and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the wild."
