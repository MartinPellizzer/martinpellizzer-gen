It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, giving it a striking appearance. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals.
