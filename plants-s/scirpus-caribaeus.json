    "intro": "Scirpus caribaeus, commonly known as the Caribbean bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which develop into cylindrical seed heads. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Scirpus caribaeus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
