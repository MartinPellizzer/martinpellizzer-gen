    "intro": "Spiranthes itchetuckneensis, commonly known as the Itchetuckne spike-rush, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and its unique spiral arrangement of flowers, which is a distinguishing feature of the Spiranthes genus. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwoods and wetlands, thriving in humid, subtropical climates. It produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
