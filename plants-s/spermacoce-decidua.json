    "intro": "Spermacoce decidua, commonly known as the deciduous morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
