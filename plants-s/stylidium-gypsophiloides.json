    "intro": "Stylidium gypsophiloides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a member of the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its unique, ephemeral flowers that open only briefly in the morning. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces vivid red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its short blooming period and striking appearance, it is a notable species in its native habitat."
