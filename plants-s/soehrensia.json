    "intro": "Soehrensia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Soehrensia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. Their foliage is usually gray-green, with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments."
