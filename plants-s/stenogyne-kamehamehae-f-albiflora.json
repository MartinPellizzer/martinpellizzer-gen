    "intro": "Stenogyne kamehamehae f. albiflora, commonly known as the Kamehameha's white-flowered ironwood, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforest understories. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
