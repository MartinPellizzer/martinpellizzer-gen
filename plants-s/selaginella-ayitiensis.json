    "intro": "Selaginella ayitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and distinctive reproductive structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its morphology includes a short, creeping stem with whorled leaves, and it produces microsporangia and megasporangia for reproduction. Selaginella ayitiensis is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
