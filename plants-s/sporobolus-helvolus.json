    "intro": "Sporobolus helvolus, commonly known as rough blazinggrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
