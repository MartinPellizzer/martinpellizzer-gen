    "intro": "Solenandra myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved screw pine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and distinctive, small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, fibrous roots adapted to coastal and saline environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Solenandra myrtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in various island cultures."
