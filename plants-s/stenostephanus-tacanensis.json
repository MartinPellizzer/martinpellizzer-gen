    "intro": "Stenostephanus tacanensis, commonly known as the Tacana stephanus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia and Chile. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are typically small and pinkish-red, with a unique structure that sets it apart from other members of the family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
