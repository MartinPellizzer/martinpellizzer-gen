    "intro": "Stenogyne leptophylla var. retrorsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and mesic habitats, often in shaded, rocky areas. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
