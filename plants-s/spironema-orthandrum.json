    "intro": "Spironema orthandrum, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Spironema orthandrum has a thalloid structure with a central axis and spirally arranged leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
