    "intro": "Schizachyrium ursulum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stalks that bear small, spike-like clusters of bracts. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Schizachyrium ursulum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
