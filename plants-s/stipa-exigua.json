    "intro": "Stipa exigua, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, blue-green leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Stipa exigua is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
