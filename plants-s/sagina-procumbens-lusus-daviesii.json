It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine, or coastal environments, where it forms a mat of prostrate stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in these habitats. The species is known for its resilience to harsh conditions, making it a common sight in mountainous regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
