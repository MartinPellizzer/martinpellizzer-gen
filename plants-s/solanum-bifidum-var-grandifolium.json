    "intro": "Solanum bifidum var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It features prominently veined, broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that change from green to yellowish-red as they mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is sometimes studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
