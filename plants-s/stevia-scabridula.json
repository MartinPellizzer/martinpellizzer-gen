    "intro": "Stevia scabridula, commonly known as roughleaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. Stevia scabridula is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It is often used in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute due to its intense sweetness."
