    "intro": "Stelis guttifera, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating. Stelis guttifera is appreciated for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
