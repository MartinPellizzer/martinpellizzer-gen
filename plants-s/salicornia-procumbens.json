    "intro": "Salicornia procumbens, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water and reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to further minimize water evaporation. Salicornia procumbens plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
