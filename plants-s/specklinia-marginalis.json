    "intro": "Specklinia marginalis, commonly known as the marginated orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a compact rosette of elliptical, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or pale green margin. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant but is threatened by habitat loss in the wild."
