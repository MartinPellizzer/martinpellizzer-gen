    "intro": "Stelis cesarensis, commonly known as the Cesar's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with elongated, spurred petals that are often brightly colored. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis cesarensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
