    "intro": "Sideroxylon undulatum, commonly known as the wavy ironwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Sideroxylon undulatum is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
