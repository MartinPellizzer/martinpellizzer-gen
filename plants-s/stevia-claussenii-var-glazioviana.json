    "intro": "Stevia claussenii var. glazioviana, commonly known as Glaziov's sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for containing steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its low water requirements and high sweetness, it has potential as a sustainable alternative to traditional sugar sources."
