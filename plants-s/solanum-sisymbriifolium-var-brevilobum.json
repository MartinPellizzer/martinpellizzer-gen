    "intro": "Solanum sisymbriifolium var. brevilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by egg-shaped berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
