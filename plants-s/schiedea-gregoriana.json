    "intro": "Schiedea gregoriana, commonly known as Gregor's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Crambeae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Schiedea gregoriana is typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
