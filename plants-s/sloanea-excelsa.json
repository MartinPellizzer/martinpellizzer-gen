    "intro": "Sloanea excelsa, commonly known as the giant sloanea, is a large evergreen tree native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 40 meters, and its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing edible seeds. Sloanea excelsa thrives in humid, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it an important resource in certain regions."
