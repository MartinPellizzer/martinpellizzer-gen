    "intro": "Salvia vermifolia, commonly known as wormleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet to blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its common name derives from the leaf's appearance, which resembles the segmented bodies of earthworms. Salvia vermifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
