    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos tephrophyllus, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spherical spore cases that resemble small cups, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant has feathery fronds with a bright yellow hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
