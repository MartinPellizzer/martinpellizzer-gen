    "intro": "Sporobolus stachydanthus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bristly, awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. Sporobolus stachydanthus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
