    "intro": "Senecio alpinus, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, papery seed heads. Senecio alpinus is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
