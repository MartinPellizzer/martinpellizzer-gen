It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly spikes that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is a hardy annual that thrives in temperate and subtropical climates. Due to its high nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for grain."
