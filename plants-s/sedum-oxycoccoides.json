    "intro": "Sedum oxycoccoides, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant. Sedum oxycoccoides is a low-growing perennial that spreads via offsets, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
