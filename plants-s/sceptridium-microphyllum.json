    "intro": "Sceptridium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and tiny, scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
