    "intro": "Sorbus barrandienica, commonly known as the Barrandian whitebeam, is a rare and ancient species of rowan native to the Czech Republic. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in areas with moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation priority."
