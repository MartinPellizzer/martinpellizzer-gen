    "intro": "Sonchus friesii var. integer, commonly known as the smoothleaf sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lobed leaves that are smooth and less hairy compared to other varieties of Sonchus. The plant produces yellow flowers in a cluster, which are followed by spherical seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The leaves are edible when young but can become bitter and less palatable as the plant matures."
