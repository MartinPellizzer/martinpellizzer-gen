It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are known for their ornamental value. Its leaves are typically ovate and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in humid environments.
