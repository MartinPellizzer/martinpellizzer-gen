    "intro": "Sida megalorrhiza, commonly known as the large-leaf sida, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its fibrous roots and stems make it a useful plant for fiber production in some regions. Sida megalorrhiza is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments."
