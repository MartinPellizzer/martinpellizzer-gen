    "intro": "Schizachyrium striatum, commonly known as gray bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and woodland habitats. It features slender, upright stems with a distinctive grayish-blue coloration, especially when mature. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fine, thread-like flowers, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Schizachyrium striatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
