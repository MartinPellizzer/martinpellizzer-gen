    "intro": "Selaginella lagunensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a stem that is usually short and prostrate, with spirally arranged leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. Selaginella lagunensis reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is often found in rocky or forested areas where humidity is high. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
