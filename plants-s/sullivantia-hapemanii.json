    "intro": "Sullivantia hapemanii, commonly known as the Hapeman's sullivantia, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in woodland areas, preferring partial shade. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
