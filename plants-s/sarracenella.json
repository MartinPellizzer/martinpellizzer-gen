    "intro": "Sarracenella, commonly known as the golden cup or the golden bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Sarracenella species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often forming dense clumps with attractive, waxy leaves. The flowers are often tubular and are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
