    "intro": "Searsia tumulicola, commonly known as the knobthorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in rounded heads, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Searsia tumulicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
