It features rosettes of broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
