    "intro": "Steffensia asperiuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaved steppe dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Steffensia asperiuscula is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
