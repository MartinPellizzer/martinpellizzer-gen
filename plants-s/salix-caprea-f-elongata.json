    "intro": "Salix caprea f. elongata, commonly known as the longleaf willow, is a variant of the common willow. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often longer than they are wide. This form typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in riparian habitats."
