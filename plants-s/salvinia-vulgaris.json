    "intro": "Salvinia vulgaris, commonly known as floating moss, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, floating mats of tiny, overlapping leaves that form a dense layer on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizomes that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called sporocarps, are borne on the upper surface of the leaves and contain spores for propagation. Salvinia vulgaris is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
