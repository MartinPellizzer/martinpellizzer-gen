    "intro": "Stellera villosa, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a member of the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Stellera villosa thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks."
