    "intro": "Stevia nepetifolia f. leucantha, commonly known as white leaf stevia, is a cultivar of the stevia plant native to South America. It is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which are smaller and more delicate compared to the typical green leaves of other stevia varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements. While it shares the sweet taste of other stevia species, it is less commonly used for herbal purposes."
