    "intro": "Sabina excelsa, commonly known as the Himalayan juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
