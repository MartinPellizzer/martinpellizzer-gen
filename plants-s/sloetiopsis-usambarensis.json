    "intro": "Sloetiopsis usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara slope heath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
