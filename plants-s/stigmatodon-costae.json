    "intro": "Stigmatodon costae, commonly known as the coastal stigmatodon, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and well adapted to the sandy soils of its coastal habitat. Stigmatodon costae is often found growing in tidal zones and is tolerant of salt spray and periodic flooding."
