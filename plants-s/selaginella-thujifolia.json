    "intro": "Selaginella thujifolia, commonly known as the Irish moss or ground moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. The plant has a unique structure with two types of leaves: microphylls and megaphylls, which are adapted for efficient water retention and photosynthesis. It is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often found in temperate regions. Selaginella thujifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
