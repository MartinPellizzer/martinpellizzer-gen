    "intro": "Serapias siciliensis, commonly known as the Sicilian marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant grows in wet, marshy areas and has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as bees and wasps, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Serapias siciliensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
