    "intro": "Stelis flexuosa, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and often forms dense, spiral-like growth patterns on trees. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a spiral, aiding in light capture in its canopy habitat. Stelis flexuosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
