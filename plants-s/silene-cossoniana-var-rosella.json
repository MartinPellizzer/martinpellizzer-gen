It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in stabilized dune environments. Silene cossoniana var. rosella plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
