    "intro": "Selaginella bigelovii, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged spirally around its stems, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selaginella bigelovii is characterized by its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a common species in desert regions of the southwestern United States. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
