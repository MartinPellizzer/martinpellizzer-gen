    "intro": "Sideroxylon uniloculare, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
