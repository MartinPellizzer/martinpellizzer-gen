    "intro": "Sambucus borealis, commonly known as the northern elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Sambucus borealis is often found in wetlands, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
