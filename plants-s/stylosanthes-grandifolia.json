    "intro": "Stylosanthes grandifolia, commonly known as the largeflower stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Stylosanthes grandifolia is valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important forage crop in arid and semi-arid environments. Its adaptability to poor soils and drought resistance further enhance its utility in sustainable agricultural systems."
