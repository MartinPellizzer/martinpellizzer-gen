    "intro": "Selago aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has a shallow root system that helps it survive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Selago aggregata is often found in dunes and along coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
