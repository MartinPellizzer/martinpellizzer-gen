    "intro": "Sambucus xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Adoxaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from yellow to orange, which are typically harvested in the fall. These berries are not only ornamental but also have historical uses in traditional medicine. However, they are toxic when raw and should be cooked before consumption."
