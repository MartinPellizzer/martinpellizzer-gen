    "intro": "Schoenoplectus pungens var. longispicatus, commonly known as the long-spined bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that are covered in small, spiky bracts, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. This species is adapted to moist or waterlogged soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
