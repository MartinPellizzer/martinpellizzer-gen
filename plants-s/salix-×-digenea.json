    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 digenea, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix matsudana (Chinese willow), resulting in its unique weeping habit. The plant is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often adorned with small, bright green leaves. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and parks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically beneficial."
