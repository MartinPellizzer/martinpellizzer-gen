    "intro": "Salix wilhelmsiana f. ciliuensis, commonly known as the Cilician willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
