    "intro": "Stellaria rugegensis f. parvipetala, commonly known as the small-petaled starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing star-shaped flowers with five petals. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. This fern-like appearance and delicate flowers make it a notable species in certain botanical gardens and natural habitats."
