    "intro": "Sedum viridulum, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, rounded leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, ornamental plants."
