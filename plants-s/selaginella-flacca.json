    "intro": "Selaginella flacca, commonly known as the flat mossy spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with low humidity. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit, with scale-like leaves that are usually a dull green to reddish-brown in color. Selaginella flacca produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are borne on strobila, or cone-like structures. It is well adapted to survive in harsh environments due to its ability to enter a state of dormancy during periods of drought."
