    "intro": "Scirpus triqueter subsp. rothii, commonly known as the roth's three-angled bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its triangular stems and dense, fibrous root system. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
