    "intro": "Selaginella eggersii, commonly known as the running spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branching stems. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged around the stem, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Selaginella eggersii is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures."
