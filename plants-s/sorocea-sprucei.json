    "intro": "Sorocea sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's sorocea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorocea sprucei is considered a vulnerable species."
