    "intro": "Sonchus plumerianus, commonly known as the purple prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. It often grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
