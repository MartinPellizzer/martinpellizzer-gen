    "intro": "Sphaeropteris ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the cycad family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green and leathery. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It is native to the Philippines and is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
