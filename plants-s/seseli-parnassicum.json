    "intro": "Seseli parnassicum, commonly known as the Parnassian seseli, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
