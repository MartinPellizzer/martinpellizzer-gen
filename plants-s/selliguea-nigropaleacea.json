    "intro": "Selliguea nigropaleacea, commonly known as the black-stemmed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, densely packed foliage and dark, wiry stems that give it its common name. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its structure consists of closely arranged, elongated leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Selliguea nigropaleacea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
