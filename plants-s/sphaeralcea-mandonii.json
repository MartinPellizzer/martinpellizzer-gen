    "intro": "Sphaeralcea mandonii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Sphaeralcea mandonii is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep root systems and a low, sprawling growth habit."
