    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 forbesii, commonly known as the Weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving it a weeping or drooping look. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
