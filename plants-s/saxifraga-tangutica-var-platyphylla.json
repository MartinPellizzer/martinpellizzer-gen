    "intro": "Saxifraga tangutica var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in a terminal cluster. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
