    "intro": "Sedum elymaiticum, commonly known as the coastal sedum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky or sandy shores. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
