    "intro": "Salix longifolia f. opaca, commonly known as the opaca willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are grouped in clusters and appear in early spring. The opaca willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
