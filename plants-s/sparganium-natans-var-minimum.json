    "intro": "Sparganium natans var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf bur-reed, is a compact aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats near the water's surface. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy, and its most distinctive characteristic is its small, spiky seed heads that float on the water. It plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and small fish. Due to its limited size and specific habitat requirements, it is less common than its larger relatives."
