    "intro": "Soulamea, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are woody and twining. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
