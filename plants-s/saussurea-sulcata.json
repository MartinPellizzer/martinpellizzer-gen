It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in alpine and subalpine regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Saussurea sulcata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
