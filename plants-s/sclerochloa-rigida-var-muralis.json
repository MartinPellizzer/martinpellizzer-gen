    "intro": "Sclerochloa rigida var. muralis, commonly known as the rigid grass or wall grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and rigid, fibrous stems that form a mat-like structure. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often used in xeriscaping and erosion control due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
