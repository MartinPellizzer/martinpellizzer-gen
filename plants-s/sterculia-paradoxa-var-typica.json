    "intro": "Sterculia paradoxa var. typica, commonly known as the Paradoxical Sterculia, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, showcasing a striking contrast of colors. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and broad leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many Sterculia species. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
