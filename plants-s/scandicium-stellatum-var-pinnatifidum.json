    "intro": "Scandicium stellatum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the star-shaped scandicium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-like inflorescences, which consist of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a radiating pattern. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
