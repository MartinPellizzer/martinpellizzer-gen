    "intro": "Stevia monardifolia var. amblyolepis, commonly known as sweetleaf or sugarleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with tiny, clear glands, which produce a high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its foliage is often used as a substitute for sugar in culinary applications due to its intense sweetness. The species is valued in both horticulture and as a natural sweetener alternative."
