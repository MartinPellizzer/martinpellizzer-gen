    "intro": "Stellaria borealis var. apetala, commonly known as the Arctic starflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and linear, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivorous animals."
