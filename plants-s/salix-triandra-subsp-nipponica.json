    "intro": "Salix triandra subsp. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
