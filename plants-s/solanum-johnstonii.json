    "intro": "Solanum johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, purple or white flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
