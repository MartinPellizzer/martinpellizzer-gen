    "intro": "Spiranthes adnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Spiranthes adnata is an important species for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
