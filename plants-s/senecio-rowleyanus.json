It features clusters of bead-like leaves that hang gracefully from its stems, giving it a unique, cascading appearance. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is drought-tolerant and prefers warm temperatures, making it an ideal choice for indoor gardening. Its simple care requirements and ornamental appeal make it a popular houseplant."
