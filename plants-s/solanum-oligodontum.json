    "intro": "Solanum oligodontum, commonly known as the small-leaved nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
