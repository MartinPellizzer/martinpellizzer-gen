    "intro": "Senna cana var. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white senna, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of many small leaflets. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
