    "intro": "Senegalia comosa, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Senegalia comosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
