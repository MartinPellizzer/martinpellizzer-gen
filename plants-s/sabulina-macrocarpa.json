    "intro": "Sabulina macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabulina macrocarpa is considered a rare and endangered species."
