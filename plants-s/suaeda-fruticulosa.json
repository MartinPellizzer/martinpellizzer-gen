    "intro": "Suaeda fruticulosa, commonly known as seaside saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is well adapted to saline and arid environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it useful for stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Suaeda fruticulosa is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
