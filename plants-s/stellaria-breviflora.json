    "intro": "Stellaria breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Stellaria breviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
