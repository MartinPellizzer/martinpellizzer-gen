    "intro": "Sapium sebiferum var. dabeshanense, commonly known as the Dabeshan Chinese tallowtree, is a variant of the Chinese tallowtree native to southern China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by orange to red drupes that contain a single seed. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, oily aril, which is a key feature of the genus Sapium. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest margins."
