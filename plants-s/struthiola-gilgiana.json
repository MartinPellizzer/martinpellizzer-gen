    "intro": "Struthiola gilgiana, commonly known as the Gilgian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Struthiola gilgiana has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
