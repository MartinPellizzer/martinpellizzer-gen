    "intro": "Sapranthus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower stem that rises from the base of the foliage. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sapranthus chiapensis is considered an endangered species."
