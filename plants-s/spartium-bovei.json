    "intro": "Spartium bovei, commonly known as Bove's sparrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Spartium bovei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
