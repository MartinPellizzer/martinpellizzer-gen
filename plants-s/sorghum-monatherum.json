    "intro": "Sorghum monatherum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to Africa and is characterized by its compact stature and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it distinct from other sorghum species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flowers. Sorghum monatherum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
