    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos subcanescens, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Sphaerostephanos subcanescens is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
