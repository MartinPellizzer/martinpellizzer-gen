    "intro": "Senecio seminiveus, commonly known as the snowflake weed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that resemble snowflakes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh, snowy conditions. Senecio seminiveus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is an important part of alpine ecosystems."
