    "intro": "Sesbania fusca, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hairy, spiny pods that aid in seed dispersal. Sesbania fusca is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities and rapid growth."
