    "intro": "Salix alba var. argentea, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and striking white to silver-gray undersides on its leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, silky texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value, especially for the way its leaves shimmer in the wind. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
