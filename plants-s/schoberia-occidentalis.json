    "intro": "Schoberia occidentalis, commonly known as the western schoberia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in the spring, are usually pale yellow to white, and the plant is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Schoberia occidentalis is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
