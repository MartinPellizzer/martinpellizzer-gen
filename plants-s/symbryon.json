    "intro": "Symbryon, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique botanical organism that lacks traditional roots, stems, and leaves. It is a type of liverwort, belonging to the group of non-vascular plants called mosses and liverworts. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or stone. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a leaf-like body that absorbs nutrients through its surface. Symbryon plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
