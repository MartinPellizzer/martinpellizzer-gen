    "intro": "Salix sapporoensis, commonly known as the Sapporo willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
