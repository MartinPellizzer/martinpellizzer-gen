    "intro": "Schizoglossum violaceum, commonly known as the violet-eyed orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking violet-colored petals and sepals, which give it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Schizoglossum violaceum is considered a delicate and endangered species."
