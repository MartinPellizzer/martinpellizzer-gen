    "intro": "Styphelia pilibunda, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the cool, humid forests of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Styphelia pilibunda thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as understorey habitats in temperate rainforests."
