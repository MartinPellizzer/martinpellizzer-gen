    "intro": "Stelis franciscana, commonly known as the Friscana orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in racemes. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of many orchids. Stelis franciscana thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of rainforests."
