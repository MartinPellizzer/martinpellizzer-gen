    "intro": "Solanum murinum, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which turn from green to black as they mature. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanin and scopolamine. Despite its toxicity, Solanum murinum has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
