    "intro": "Sarcophrynium prionogonium var. prionogonium, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces distinctive cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and covered in a reddish-brown, fibrous coating. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The leaves are typically a deep green, with a waxy texture, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is a popular choice for tropical gardens and conservation efforts."
