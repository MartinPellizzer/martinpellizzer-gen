    "intro": "Sarcocaulon multifidum, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red berries. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Sarcocaulon multifidum is valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
