It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in cloud forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
