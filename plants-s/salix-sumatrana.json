It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender branches and elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine or swampy habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras for seed dispersal. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
