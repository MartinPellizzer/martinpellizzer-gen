    "intro": "Salix stylaris var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
