    "intro": "Sarcocornia pacifica, commonly known as sea barley, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae, characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
