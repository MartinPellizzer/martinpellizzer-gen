    "intro": "Stelis venusta, commonly known as the showy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows, typical of many orchid species. Stelis venusta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
