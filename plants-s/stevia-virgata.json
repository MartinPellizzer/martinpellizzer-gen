    "intro": "Stevia virgata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring sweeteners. Its leaves are often used as a sugar substitute due to their intense sweetness. Stevia virgata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
