    "intro": "Sagittaria alpina var. emersa, commonly known as the upland arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, featuring arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Sagittaria alpina var. emersa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse aquatic conditions."
