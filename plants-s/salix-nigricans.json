    "intro": "Salix nigricans, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Black willow thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
