    "intro": "Sorbus chamaemespilus subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
