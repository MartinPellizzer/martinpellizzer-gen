    "intro": "Sphaeropteris albosetacea, commonly known as the white-setae cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery spores. The plant belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is notable for its unique reproductive structures, including the female cones that produce seeds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival. Its botanical features make it an important subject for both scientific study and conservation biology."
