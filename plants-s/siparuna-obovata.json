    "intro": "Siparuna obovata, commonly known as the pink shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds."
