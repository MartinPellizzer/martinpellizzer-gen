It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many familiar herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
