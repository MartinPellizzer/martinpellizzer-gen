    "intro": "Sacodon, commonly known as the \"false sandalwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. They are often shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Sacodon species are valued for their wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction, though they are not as commercially significant as true sandalwood."
