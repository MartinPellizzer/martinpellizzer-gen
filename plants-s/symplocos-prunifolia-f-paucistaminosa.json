    "intro": "Symplocos prunifolia f. paucistaminosa, commonly known as the sparse-stamen sweetleaf, is a botanical variant of the sweetleaf species. It is characterized by its reduced number of stamens, a trait that distinguishes it from the typical form of Symplocos prunifolia. The plant is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red berries. The leaves are usually elliptical, glossy, and have a distinct sweet scent when crushed."
