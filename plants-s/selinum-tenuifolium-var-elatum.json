    "intro": "Selinum tenuifolium var. elatum, commonly known as tall narrow-leaved selenium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its foliage is sometimes used in herbal remedies, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
