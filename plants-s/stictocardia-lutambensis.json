    "intro": "Stictocardia lutambensis, commonly known as the Lutamb\u00e9 lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. It is often found growing on bark, stones, or soil in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
