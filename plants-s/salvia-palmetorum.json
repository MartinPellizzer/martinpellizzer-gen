    "intro": "Salvia palmetorum, commonly known as the Mexican sage or palmetto sage, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that resemble palm fronds, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking violet to purple flower spikes in the spring, which are borne on tall, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, Salvia palmetorum is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
