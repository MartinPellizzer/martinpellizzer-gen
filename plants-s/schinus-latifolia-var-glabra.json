    "intro": "Schinus latifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, compound leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, red drupes that are highly aromatic and contain a single seed. It is often found in coastal and tropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in some areas."
