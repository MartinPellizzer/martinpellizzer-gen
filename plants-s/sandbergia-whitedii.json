    "intro": "Sandbergia whitedii, commonly known as the White's sandbergia, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sandbergia whitedii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
