    "intro": "Scabiosa coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers resembling a crown, hence its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa coronopifolia is also valued for its nectar-rich blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
