    "intro": "Stenochlaena elaphoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Stenochlaena elaphoglossoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
