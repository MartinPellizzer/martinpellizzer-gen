    "intro": "Surfacea racemosa var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim surfacea, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
