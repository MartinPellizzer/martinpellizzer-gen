    "intro": "Stylocoryna orophila, commonly known as the mountain stylocoryna, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and upright growth habit, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, Stylocoryna orophila is considered a vulnerable species."
