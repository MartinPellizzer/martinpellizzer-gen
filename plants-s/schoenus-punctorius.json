    "intro": "Schoenus punctorius, commonly known as the punctured sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schoenus punctorius is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
