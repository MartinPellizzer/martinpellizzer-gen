    "intro": "Salsola glauca, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, fleshy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Salsola glauca is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
