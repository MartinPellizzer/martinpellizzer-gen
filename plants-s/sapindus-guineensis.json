    "intro": "Sapindus guineensis, commonly known as the African soapnut, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain hard, brown seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the fruit's ability to produce a soapy lather when rubbed, making it useful for cleansing. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests and secondary growth areas."
