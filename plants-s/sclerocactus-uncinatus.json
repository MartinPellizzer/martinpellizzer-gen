It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are often curved or hooked, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Sclerocactus uncinatus is generally slow-growing and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in dry climates."
