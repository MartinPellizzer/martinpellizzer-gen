    "intro": "Seseli gigantissimum, commonly known as the giant seseli, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its towering stature and showy white flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of California, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants, while its flower clusters form dense, spherical umbels that bloom in late spring. The plant's unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
