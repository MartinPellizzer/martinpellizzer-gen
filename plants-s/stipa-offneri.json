    "intro": "Stipa offneri, commonly known as the Offner's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, awned florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Stipa offneri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
