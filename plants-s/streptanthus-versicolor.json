    "intro": "Streptanthus versicolor, commonly known as the variable glory-of-the-snow, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers. This perennial herb is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it thrives in rocky and coastal habitats. It features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate and produces clusters of bright yellow or white flowers in early spring. The plant's name reflects its variable coloration and the striking contrast between its foliage and floral displays. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
