    "intro": "Syzygium tahanense, commonly known as Tahan's apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy,\u692d\u5706\u5f62 (elliptical) leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apples, with a smooth, red or yellow skin. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
