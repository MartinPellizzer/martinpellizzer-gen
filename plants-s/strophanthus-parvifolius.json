    "intro": "Strophanthus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
