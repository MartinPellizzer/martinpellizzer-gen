It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers. The leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive ciliate margin, which gives the species its scientific name. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its delicate appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitats."
