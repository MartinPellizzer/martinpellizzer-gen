    "intro": "Struthiopteris varians, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's ability to thrive in diverse soil types makes it a common sight in temperate regions."
