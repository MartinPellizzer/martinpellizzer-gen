    "intro": "Salacia attenuata, commonly known as the slender salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Salacia attenuata is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
