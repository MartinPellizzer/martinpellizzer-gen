    "intro": "Selaginella sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaved spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant features wiry stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments due to its ability to enter a dormant state during droughts. Selaginella sparsifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
