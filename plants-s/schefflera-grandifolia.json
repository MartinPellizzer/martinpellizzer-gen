    "intro": "Schefflera grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its adaptability makes it popular in both ornamental horticulture and landscaping."
