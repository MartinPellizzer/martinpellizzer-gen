It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Stipagrostis lutescens is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
