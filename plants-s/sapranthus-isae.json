    "intro": "Sapranthus isae, commonly known as the island lily, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
