    "intro": "Saxifraga rotundifolia proles chrysospleniifolia, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh cold and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in colder climates."
