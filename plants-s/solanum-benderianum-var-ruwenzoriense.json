    "intro": "Solanum benderianum var. ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and showy purple or violet flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its mountainous habitat."
