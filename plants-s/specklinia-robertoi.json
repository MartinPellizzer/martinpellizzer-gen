    "intro": "Specklinia robertoi, commonly known as the Robert's cryptostele, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Specklinia robertoi is considered a conservation concern."
