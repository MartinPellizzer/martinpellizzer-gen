    "intro": "Saxifraga exilis, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saxifraga exilis is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
