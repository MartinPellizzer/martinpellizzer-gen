    "intro": "Specklinia wacketii, commonly known as the Wacket's lithops, is a rare and striking member of the Aizoaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small, yellow or orange, and appear in late winter or early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Specklinia wacketii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
