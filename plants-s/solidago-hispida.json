    "intro": "Solidago hispida, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a slightly zigzagged margin. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open fields, prairies, and along roadsides. Solidago hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
