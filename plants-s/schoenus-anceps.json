    "intro": "Schoenus anceps, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a smooth texture, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. Schoenus anceps plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
