It is characterized by its hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance compared to other willow varieties. This plant is typically found in moist, temperate regions and thrives in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
