    "intro": "Scilla orientalis, commonly known as the oriental squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It produces striking blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant during unfavorable conditions. Scilla orientalis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
