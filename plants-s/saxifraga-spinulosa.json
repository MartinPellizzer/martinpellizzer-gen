    "intro": "Saxifraga spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga spinulosa is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
