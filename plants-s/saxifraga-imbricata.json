    "intro": "Saxifraga imbricata, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Its leaves are usually oval or spoon-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga imbricata is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
