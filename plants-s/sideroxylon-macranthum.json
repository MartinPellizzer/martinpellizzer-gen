    "intro": "Sideroxylon macranthum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan."
