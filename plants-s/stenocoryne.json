    "intro": "Stenocoryne, commonly known as the African violets, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, violet-colored flowers and are often cultivated as ornamental plants. Stenocoryne species typically have broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. They thrive in warm, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, with *Stenocoryne crassifolia* being one of the most commonly grown varieties."
