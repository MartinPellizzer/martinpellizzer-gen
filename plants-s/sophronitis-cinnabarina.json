    "intro": "Sophronitis cinnabarina, commonly known as the Cinnabar Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which resemble the colors of cinnabar, a historical pigment. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, erect stem and broad, leathery leaves. Its flowers are borne on a single stem and are often clustered in a raceme, making it a visually appealing species. Sophronitis cinnabarina is valued in horticulture for its vibrant colors and relatively easy care requirements."
