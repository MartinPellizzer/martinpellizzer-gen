    "intro": "Sullivantia sullivantii, commonly known as the Sullivant's bluemink, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
