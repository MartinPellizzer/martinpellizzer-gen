    "intro": "Seaforthia dicksonii, commonly known as the Cape Peninsula cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the western Cape of South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
