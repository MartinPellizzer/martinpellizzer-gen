    "intro": "Salix novae-angliae myrtillifolia, commonly known as the New England myrtleleaf willow, is a rare and unique species of willow native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers early in the spring. Its leaves emit a mild, aromatic scent, which is a notable feature in its botanical profile. This species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats."
