    "intro": "Solanum fernandesii, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Solanum fernandesii is a hardy species that is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
