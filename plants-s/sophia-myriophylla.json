    "intro": "Sophia myriophylla, commonly known as the flame bush, is a striking shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, colorful foliage that ranges from red to orange, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Sophia myriophylla is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils."
