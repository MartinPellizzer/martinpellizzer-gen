    "intro": "Sussea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Sussea microcarpa is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
