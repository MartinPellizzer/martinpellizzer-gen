    "intro": "Stelis xerophila, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations for survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, which helps store water, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Stelis xerophila is valued for its resilience and unique aesthetic, making it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
