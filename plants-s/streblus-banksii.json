    "intro": "Streblus banksii, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Streblus banksii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
