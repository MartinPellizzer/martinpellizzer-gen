    "intro": "Sinosenecio dryas, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the extreme conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sinosenecio dryas plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar to pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous region."
