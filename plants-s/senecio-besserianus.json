It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that resemble snowballs. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
