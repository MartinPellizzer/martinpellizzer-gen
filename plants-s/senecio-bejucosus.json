    "intro": "Senecio bejucosus, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio bejucosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
