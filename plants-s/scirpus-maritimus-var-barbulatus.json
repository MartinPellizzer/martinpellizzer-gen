It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, velvety texture. This variety is adapted to tidal environments and plays a crucial role in providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species."
