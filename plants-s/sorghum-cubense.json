    "intro": "Sorghum cubense, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stalks and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open fields or along roadsides. Due to its resilience and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
