It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the spurge family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
