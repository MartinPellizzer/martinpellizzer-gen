    "intro": "Solenanthus olgae, commonly known as the Olgae's solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sunlight. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying Hawaiian flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
