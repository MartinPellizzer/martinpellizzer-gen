    "intro": "Saxifraga hemisphaerica, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga hemisphaerica is often found in mountainous areas and is a hardy species that can survive in extreme conditions."
