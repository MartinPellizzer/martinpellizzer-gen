    "intro": "Solanum medusae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the nightshade family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces large, bell-shaped flowers that are pale green with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Solanum medusae is notable for its unique morphology and is often considered a botanical curiosity due to its unusual appearance."
