    "intro": "Schizachne purpurascens var. callosa, commonly known as the hairy purple grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to reddish-brown inflorescence. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture on both surfaces. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, often in disturbed or wetland habitats. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered and can be either paniculate or spikelike in structure."
