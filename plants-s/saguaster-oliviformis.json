    "intro": "Saguaster oliviformis, commonly known as the oliveleaf saguaro, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that branch out into arms as it matures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall. Saguaster oliviformis plays an important role in the desert ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
