    "intro": "Sphaeralcea galeottii, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and sandy plains. It has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its adaptation to harsh desert conditions."
