    "intro": "Stevia vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic stevia, is a rare species native to the volcanic regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and prefers a humid, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
