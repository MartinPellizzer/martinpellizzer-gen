    "intro": "Salix gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. Salix gussonei is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in harsh mountainous regions."
