    "intro": "Sphaeroma chilense, commonly known as the Chilean sea hare, is a species of sea hare found primarily in the coastal waters of South America. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and distinctive coloration. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a specialized radula used for feeding on algae and other marine vegetation. Its reproductive system is complex, with separate sexes and a unique method of external fertilization. Sphaeroma chilense plays an important ecological role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine predators."
