The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known species like tomatoes and potatoes. Solanum azureum typically grows as a climbing vine, featuring heart-shaped leaves and showy blossoms that attract pollinators. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
