    "intro": "Stenocarpus dareoides, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with a compact form that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant. Stenocarpus dareoides is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests."
