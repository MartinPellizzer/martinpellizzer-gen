    "intro": "Stackhousia umbellata, commonly known as the mountain daisy or rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stackhousia umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
