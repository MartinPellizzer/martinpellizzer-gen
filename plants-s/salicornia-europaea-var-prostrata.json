    "intro": "Salicornia europaea var. prostrata, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a low-growing, succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, often forming dense mats. Its ability to accumulate salt makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
