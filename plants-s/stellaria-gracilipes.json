    "intro": "Stellaria gracilipes, commonly known as slender starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, covered with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows. Stellaria gracilipes is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments and is known for its delicate appearance."
