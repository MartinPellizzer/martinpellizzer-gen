    "intro": "Sedum angustipetalum, commonly known as narrow-petaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fleshy, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
