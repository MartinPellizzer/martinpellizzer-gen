    "intro": "Sayeria atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish-violet petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sayeria atroviolacea is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
