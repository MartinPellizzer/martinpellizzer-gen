It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
