    "intro": "Sedum diffusum, commonly known as the spreading stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Eurasia. It features fleshy, spreading stems and small, often blue or greenish leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, including colder regions."
