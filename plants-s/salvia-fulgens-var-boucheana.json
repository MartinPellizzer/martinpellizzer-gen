It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround clusters of small, tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, featuring gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens in warmer climates.
