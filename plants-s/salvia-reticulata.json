    "intro": "Salvia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage with a distinctive net-like vein pattern. The plant produces striking spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Salvia reticulata is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
