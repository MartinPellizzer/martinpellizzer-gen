    "intro": "Sagittaria subulata var. lorata, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive pointed tip. The plant produces small, white flowers that rise above the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
