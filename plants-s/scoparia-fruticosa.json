    "intro": "Scoparia fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by spherical, spiny seed heads. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs and have a slightly succulent texture. Scoparia fruticosa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
