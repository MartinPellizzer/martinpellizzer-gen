    "intro": "Scandix parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that are often reddish-purple in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and can reach up to 1 meter in length. Scandix parviflora is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photodermatitis when exposed to sunlight."
