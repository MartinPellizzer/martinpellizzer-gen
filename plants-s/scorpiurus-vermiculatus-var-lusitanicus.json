    "intro": "Scorpiurus vermiculatus var. lusitanicus, commonly known as the Lusitanian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime climates. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
