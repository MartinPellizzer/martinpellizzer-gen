    "intro": "Salvia leveilleana, commonly known as the Cape York sage, is a perennial shrub native to the wet tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers in terminal spikes, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Salvia leveilleana is well adapted to humid, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
