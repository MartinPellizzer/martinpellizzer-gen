    "intro": "Saxifraga umbrosa var. primuloides, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of glossy, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
