    "intro": "Stipa constricta, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Stipa constricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
