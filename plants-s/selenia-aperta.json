    "intro": "Selenia aperta, commonly known as the open moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, yellow berries that contain the seeds. Selenia aperta is typically found in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit and medicinal properties make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
