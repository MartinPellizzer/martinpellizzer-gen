    "intro": "Saxifraga hirsuta subsp. paucicrenata, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its growth habit is compact, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. Saxifraga hirsuta subsp. paucicrenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
