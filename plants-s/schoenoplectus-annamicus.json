    "intro": "Schoenoplectus annamicus, commonly known as the Annamite bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the stabilization of wetland soils. Schoenoplectus annamicus plays an important ecological role in providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
