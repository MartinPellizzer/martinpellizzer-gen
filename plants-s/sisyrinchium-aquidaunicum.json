It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's adaptability to aquatic conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
