    "intro": "Salix arnellii, commonly known as Arnold's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pairs and serve as the primary means of pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery strips. Salix arnellii is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
