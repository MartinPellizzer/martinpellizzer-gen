    "intro": "Solanum sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. Solanum sprucei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
