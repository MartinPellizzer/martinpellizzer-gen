    "intro": "Stachys saxicola subsp. laxa, commonly known as the loose-stemmed betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or blue, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and limestone outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and dryland landscapes."
