    "intro": "Sporobolus geniculatus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is known for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
