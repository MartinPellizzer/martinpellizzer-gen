    "intro": "Sanguisorba mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean dock, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, upright stems that bear large, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a hardy plant adapted to dry, rocky soils. Sanguisorba mediterranea is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
