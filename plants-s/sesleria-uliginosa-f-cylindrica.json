It features slender, cylindrical inflorescences that are often tinged with purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in damp, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and bog environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue that adds visual interest. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting invertebrate life."
