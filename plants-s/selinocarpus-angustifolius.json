    "intro": "Selinocarpus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved selinocarpus, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, forested areas and has a tall, slender stem that bears small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are small and oval, with a distinctive ribbed surface, and it is often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
