These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plants often grow in shaded, humid environments.
