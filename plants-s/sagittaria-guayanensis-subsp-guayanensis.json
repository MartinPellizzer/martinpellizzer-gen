    "intro": "Sagittaria guayanensis subsp. guayanensis, commonly known as the Guayana arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive spongy structure that aids in gas exchange. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing above the water surface. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and its aesthetic appeal in wetland environments."
