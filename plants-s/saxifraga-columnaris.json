    "intro": "Saxifraga columnaris, commonly known as the columnar saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems that can grow up to several feet tall, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to harsh alpine environments. Saxifraga columnaris is often used in rock gardens due to its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun."
