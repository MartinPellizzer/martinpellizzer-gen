    "intro": "Schoenoplectus patentiglumis, commonly known as the broad-awned bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and the seeds are enclosed in small, spike-like structures called glumes. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
