    "intro": "Selliguea taeniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leafy shoot system, and its leaves are elongated and often arranged in a spiral pattern. Selliguea taeniata lacks true roots, stems, and flowers, and instead reproduces through spores released from specialized structures called sporocarps. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms."
