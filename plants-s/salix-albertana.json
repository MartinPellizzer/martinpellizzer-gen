    "intro": "Salix albertana, commonly known as the sand willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Salix albertana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
