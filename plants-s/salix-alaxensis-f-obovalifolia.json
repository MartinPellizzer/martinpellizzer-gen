    "intro": "Salix alaxensis f. obovalifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Salix alaxensis species. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. This shrub typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its botanical features include small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. The plant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in the mountainous areas of western North America."
