    "intro": "Scleria lagoensis, commonly known as the marsh speargrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria lagoensis typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
