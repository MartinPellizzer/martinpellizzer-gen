    "intro": "Sophronitis coccinea f. rossiteriana, commonly known as the Rossiter's red orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically red or pink in color, with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, warm environments with high light exposure. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid in the orchid breeding community, contributing to the diversity of cultivated orchids."
