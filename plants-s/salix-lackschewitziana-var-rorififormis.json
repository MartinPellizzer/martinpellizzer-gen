    "intro": "Salix lackschewitziana var. rorififormis, commonly known as the fluffball willow, is a unique variant of the willow genus characterized by its distinctive fluffy, cotton-like catkins. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Its catkins are particularly showy, with the male flowers forming dense, fluffy clusters that resemble small clouds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
