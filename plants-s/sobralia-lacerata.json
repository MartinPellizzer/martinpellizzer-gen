    "intro": "Sobralia lacerata, commonly known as the showy sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Sobralia lacerata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
