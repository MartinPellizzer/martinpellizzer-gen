    "intro": "Struthanthus concinnus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Loasaceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Struthanthus concinnus is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
