    "intro": "Salix lasiandra var. lasiandra, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and silvery-white, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, red-brown female flowers in the spring. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near streams, rivers, and wetlands. Its growth habit and ornamental features make it a notable species in riparian ecosystems."
