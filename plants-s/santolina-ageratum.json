    "intro": "Santolina ageratum, commonly known as silver mound or Mexican santolina, is a low-growing shrub native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate touch to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Santolina ageratum is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
