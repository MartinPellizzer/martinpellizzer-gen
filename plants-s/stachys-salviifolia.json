    "intro": "Stachys salviifolia, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs and have a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces spikes of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, peppery flavor, making it a useful plant in both culinary and medicinal applications. Stachys salviifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded gardens."
