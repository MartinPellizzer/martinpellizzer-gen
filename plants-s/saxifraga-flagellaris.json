    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga flagellaris is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
