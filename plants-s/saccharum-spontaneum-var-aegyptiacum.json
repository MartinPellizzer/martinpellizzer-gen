This variant is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia, characterized by its robust growth and high sugar content in its stalks. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wetland or marshy areas. The plant has been historically used for sugar production and as a forage crop for livestock. Its botanical features include long, fibrous leaves and a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spreading growth habit."
