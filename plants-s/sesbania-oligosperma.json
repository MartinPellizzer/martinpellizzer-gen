    "intro": "Sesbania oligosperma, commonly known as the small-seeded sesbania, is a tropical legume native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a fast-growing shrub or small tree that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing numerous tiny, dark seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used for soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
