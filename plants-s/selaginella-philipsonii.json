    "intro": "Selaginella philipsonii, commonly known as the Philippine spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. Selaginella philipsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
