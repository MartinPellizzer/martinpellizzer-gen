    "intro": "Stenogyne rugosa var. pubinervis, commonly known as the hairy-veined stenogyne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its hairy veins on the leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"pubinervis.\" The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with four to five petals, and are usually pale blue or white in color. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects."
