    "intro": "Silene dioica var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf redstem, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female reproductive structures, which facilitate self-pollination. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other forms of Silene dioica."
