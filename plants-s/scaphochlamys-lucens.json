    "intro": "Scaphochlamys lucens, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and bright yellow coloration, which is particularly striking in its mature form. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its morphology includes a thallus with a central axis and lateral branches, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Scaphochlamys lucens is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
