    "intro": "Spilanthes americana f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered false mustard, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its pungent, mustard-like odor, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its botanical structure supports its role as a member of the Brassicaceae family, sharing traits with other mustard family plants."
