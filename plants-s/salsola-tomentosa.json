    "intro": "Salsola tomentosa, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has spiny leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Its small, greenish flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination. Salsola tomentosa is an invasive species in many regions, spreading rapidly and forming dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation."
