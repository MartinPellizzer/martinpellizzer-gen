    "intro": "Sclerococcus, commonly known as the \"corky cushion lichen,\" is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that forms dense, cushion-shaped growths on tree bark and stone. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which together carry out photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Sclerococcus is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on shaded, moist surfaces. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its contribution to ecosystem biodiversity."
