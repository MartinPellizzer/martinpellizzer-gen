    "intro": "Schoenus distichus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbous grass, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. Schoenus distichus plays a role in providing habitat for various invertebrates and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal."
