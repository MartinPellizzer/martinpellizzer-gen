    "intro": "Schmaltzia allophyloides var. surotatensis, commonly known as the Surotatens Schmaltzia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing adaptations to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
