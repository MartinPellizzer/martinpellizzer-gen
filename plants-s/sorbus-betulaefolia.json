    "intro": "Sorbus betulaefolia, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are white- or silvery-hairy underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin, papery layers."
