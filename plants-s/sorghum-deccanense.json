    "intro": "Sorghum deccanense, commonly known as the Deccan sorghum, is a species of grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited rainfall. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Sorghum deccanense is also valued for its potential in forage and as a source of biofuel."
