    "intro": "Schrankia horridula, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters. Schrankia horridula is often found in open habitats such as sand dunes, gravelly slopes, and dry plains. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry environments."
