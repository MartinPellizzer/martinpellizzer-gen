    "intro": "Selaginella sericea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Selaginella sericea var. latifolia is an evergreen plant with a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
