    "intro": "Salix fargesii var. kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
