    "intro": "Smilax havanensis var. armata, commonly known as the Cuban arrowroot or spiny smilax, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and stout, spiny tendrils that help it climb and support itself. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinctive veining pattern. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
