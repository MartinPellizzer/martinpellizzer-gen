It features small, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and aromatic properties. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
