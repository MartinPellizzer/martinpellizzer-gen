    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus subsp. radicans, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often obscured by the foliage. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The species is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for waterfowl."
