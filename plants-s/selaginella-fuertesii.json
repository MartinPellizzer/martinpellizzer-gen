    "intro": "Selaginella fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in strobila, typical of the spikemoss group. Native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species in its habitat. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and over-collection."
