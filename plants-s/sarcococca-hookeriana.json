    "intro": "Sarcococca hookeriana, commonly known as the common sarcococca, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic value, it is often used in landscaping for its year-round interest and low maintenance requirements."
