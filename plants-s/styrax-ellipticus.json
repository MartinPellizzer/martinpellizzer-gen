    "intro": "Styrax ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hard, reddish-brown berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Styrax ellipticus is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
