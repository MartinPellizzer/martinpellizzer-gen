    "intro": "Salvia baumgartenii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sage, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and striking spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Salvia baumgartenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural growing conditions."
