    "intro": "Saussurea sukaczevii, commonly known as the Tibetan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
