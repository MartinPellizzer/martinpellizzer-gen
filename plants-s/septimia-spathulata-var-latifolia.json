    "intro": "Septimia spathulata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed septimia, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving them a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
