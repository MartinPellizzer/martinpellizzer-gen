    "intro": "Saxifraga sileneflora, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga sileneflora is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where few other plants can survive."
