It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of butterfly wings. Stelis papiliopsis thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth."
