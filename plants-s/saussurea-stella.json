    "intro": "Saussurea stella, commonly known as the star saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a distinctive star-like shape that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climatic conditions."
