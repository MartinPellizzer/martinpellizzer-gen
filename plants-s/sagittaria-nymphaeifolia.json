    "intro": "Sagittaria nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and pond edges. Sagittaria nymphaeifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
