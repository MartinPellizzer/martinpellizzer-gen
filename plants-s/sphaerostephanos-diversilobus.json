    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos diversilobus, commonly known as the multilobed starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow, typically during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
