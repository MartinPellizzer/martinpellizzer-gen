It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions such as Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length.

This species is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, thriving in humid and shaded environments."
