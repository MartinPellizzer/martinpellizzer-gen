    "intro": "Senegalia tenuifolia var. producta, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing desert landscapes."
