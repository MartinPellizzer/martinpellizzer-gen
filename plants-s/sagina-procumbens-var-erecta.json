It typically features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed ground. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a hardy, ecologically valuable species."
