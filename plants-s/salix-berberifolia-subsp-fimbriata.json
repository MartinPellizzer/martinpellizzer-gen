    "intro": "Salix berberifolia subsp. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive fringed or toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in riparian habitats and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
