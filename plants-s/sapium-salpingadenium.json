    "intro": "Sapium salpingadenium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red, lantern-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth, though it can become invasive in some regions. The plant has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States, where it is sometimes considered a weed."
