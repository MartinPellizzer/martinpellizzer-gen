    "intro": "Scirpus thouarsii, commonly known as the New Zealand bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Scirpus thouarsii is an important component of New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
