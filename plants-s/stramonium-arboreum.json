    "intro": "Stramonium arboreum, commonly known as the tree stramonium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with rough, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which make it a plant of both medicinal and cautionary interest in botanical studies."
