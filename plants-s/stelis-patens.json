    "intro": "Stelis patens, commonly known as the spreading stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Stelis patens is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is appreciated for its ornamental value in cultivation."
