    "intro": "Stelis garayi, commonly known as the Garay's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Stelis garayi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the diverse orchid flora of the Andes."
