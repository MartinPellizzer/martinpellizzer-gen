It is characterized by its spiny stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Smilax umbrosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade."
