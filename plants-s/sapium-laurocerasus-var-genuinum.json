It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions."
