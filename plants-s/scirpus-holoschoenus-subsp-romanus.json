It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, lakes, and along riverbanks. The plant features long, cylindrical stems that are often covered with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowering spikes, which appear at the top of the stems, consist of numerous small, greenish-white flowers.
