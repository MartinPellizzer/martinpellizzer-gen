    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum barteri, commonly known as the Barter's sun-plant, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling sunflowers. The plant is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum barteri is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
