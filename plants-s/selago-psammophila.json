    "intro": "Selago psammophila, commonly known as the sand flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on stalks that rise above the foliage. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Selago psammophila is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal areas."
