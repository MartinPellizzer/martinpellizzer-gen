    "intro": "Sedum lactifolium, commonly known as milky stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its common name refers to the milky sap that exudes from the stems when broken."
