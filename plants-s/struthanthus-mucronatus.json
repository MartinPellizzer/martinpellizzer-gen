    "intro": "Struthanthus mucronatus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as succulent stems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and early summer, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat. Struthanthus mucronatus is often found in sandy soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems."
