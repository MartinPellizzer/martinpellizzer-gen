    "intro": "Symplocos lachnobotrya, commonly known as the hairy-fruited boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often densely covered with short, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, leathery berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Symplocos lachnobotrya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense, compact growth habit."
