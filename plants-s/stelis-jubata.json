    "intro": "Stelis jubata, commonly known as the showy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its role in the ecosystem. Stelis jubata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
