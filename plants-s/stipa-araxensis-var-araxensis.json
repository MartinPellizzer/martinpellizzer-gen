    "intro": "Stipa araxensis var. araxensis, commonly known as the Araxes needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This grass is often found in steppe and mountainous habitats, contributing to local biodiversity and soil stability."
