    "intro": "Sagittaria subulata var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some emerging above the water surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a spike, and it produces small, round fruits that float on the water. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
