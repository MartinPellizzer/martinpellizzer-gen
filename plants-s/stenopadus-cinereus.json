    "intro": "Stenopadus cinereus, commonly known as the gray stenopadus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Stenopadus cinereus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
