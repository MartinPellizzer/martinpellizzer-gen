    "intro": "Scirpus attenuatus, commonly known as narrowleaf bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it flowers from late summer to early autumn. Scirpus attenuatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. It is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the shores of lakes and rivers."
