    "intro": "Schefflera belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to pets. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Schefflera belangeri prefers indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
