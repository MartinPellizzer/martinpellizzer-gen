It thrives in brackish and saline environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal areas. Spartina polystachya plays a crucial role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
