    "intro": "Sophora crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 cm long and composed of 10 to 20 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a flat, leathery pod that contains several seeds. Sophora crassifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodlands."
