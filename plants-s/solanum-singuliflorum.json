    "intro": "Solanum singuliflorum, commonly known as the single-flower nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive solitary, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually purple or violet in color, and it produces small, rounded berries that contain toxic alkaloids. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
