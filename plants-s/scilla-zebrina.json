    "intro": "Scilla zebrina, commonly known as the zebra lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features striking, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often striped with contrasting colors, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers in early spring, which are both ornamental and attractive to pollinators. Scilla zebrina thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage dies back in summer, but it reliably returns each spring, adding a touch of color to shady landscapes."
