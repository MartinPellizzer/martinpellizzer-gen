    "intro": "Stevia salicifolia var. virgulifera, commonly known as the Virginia leaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is closely related to other stevia species and shares similar properties, though it is less commonly used for commercial sweetener production. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants."
