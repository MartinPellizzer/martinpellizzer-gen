    "intro": "Sida pyenophylla, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Sida pyenophylla is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
