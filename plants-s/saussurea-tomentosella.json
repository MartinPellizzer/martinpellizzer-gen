    "intro": "Saussurea tomentosella, commonly known as the woolly snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) covering on its stems and leaves, which helps insulate it against the cold. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically between June and August. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often considered a symbol of resilience in harsh mountain environments."
