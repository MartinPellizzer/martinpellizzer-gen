    "intro": "Sonchus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant sow-thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive white underside. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
