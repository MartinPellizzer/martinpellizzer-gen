    "intro": "Scapha nigrescens, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green leaves with prominent black veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Scapha nigrescens is often of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
