    "intro": "Scilla pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf squill, is a small, bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. Scilla pusilla is relatively hardy and can tolerate mild frosts, though it may require protection in colder climates."
