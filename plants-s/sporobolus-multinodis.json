    "intro": "Sporobolus multinodis, commonly known as the nodular spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often highly branched and form dense underground networks, contributing to its resilience in arid environments. Sporobolus multinodis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
