    "intro": "Schnella brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name. Schnella brachystachya is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
