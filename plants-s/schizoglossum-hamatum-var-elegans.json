    "intro": "Schizoglossum hamatum var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
