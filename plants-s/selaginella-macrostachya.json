It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella macrostachya is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical significance in botanical studies."
