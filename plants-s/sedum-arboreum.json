    "intro": "Sedum arboreum, commonly known as the tree sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers in the summer, adding ornamental value to rocky or sandy landscapes. Its ability to withstand drought and poor soil makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Sedum arboreum is also valued for its low maintenance and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators."
