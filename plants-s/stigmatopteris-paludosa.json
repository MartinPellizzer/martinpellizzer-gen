    "intro": "Stigmatopteris paludosa, commonly known as the marsh shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in bogs, swamps, and other water-saturated environments. Its reproductive structures, including the sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among many ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Stigmatopteris paludosa is considered an indicator species for undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
