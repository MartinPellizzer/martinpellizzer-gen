It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant produces striking red flowers with yellow markings, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. Its leaves are typically red to orange in color, with a glossy surface that enhances its aesthetic appeal. This subspecies thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swamps."
