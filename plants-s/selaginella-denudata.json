    "intro": "Selaginella denudata, commonly known as the naked spore moss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Selaginella denudata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its spore-bearing structures are usually found on the underside of its leaves. It is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in various ecological settings."
