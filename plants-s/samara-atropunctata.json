    "intro": "Samara atropunctata, commonly known as the black-punctured samara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fruit structure, which consists of a single, winged seed enclosed in a papery casing. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Samara atropunctata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insect species and contributing to seed dispersal through wind."
