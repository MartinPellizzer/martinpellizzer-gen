    "intro": "Stachytarpheta lychnitis, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by hummingbirds and other pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Stachytarpheta lychnitis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
