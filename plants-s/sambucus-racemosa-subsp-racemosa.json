It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and divided into five to nine ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but are used in traditional medicine by some indigenous peoples. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the eastern United States."
