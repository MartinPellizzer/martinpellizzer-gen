It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a deep throat. Its fruit is a globose berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
