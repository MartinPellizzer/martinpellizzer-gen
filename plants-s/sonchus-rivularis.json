    "intro": "Sonchus rivularis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetland environments. It features rosettes of broad, waxy, light green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in many regions."
