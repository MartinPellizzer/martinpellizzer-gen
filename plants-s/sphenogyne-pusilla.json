    "intro": "Sphenogyne pusilla, commonly known as the small sphenogyne, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sphenogyneae and is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, white or pale pink blooms. Due to its limited habitat and rarity, Sphenogyne pusilla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
