    "intro": "Stoeberia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of only one species, Stoeberia corymbosa, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white, umbel-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its foliage is finely divided, giving it a delicate and ethereal appearance. Stoeberia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils."
