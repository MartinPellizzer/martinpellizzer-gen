    "intro": "Schoenocaulon gracile, commonly known as the slender stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the western United States. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on terminal racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
