    "intro": "Sedum pruinosum, commonly known as the silver sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
