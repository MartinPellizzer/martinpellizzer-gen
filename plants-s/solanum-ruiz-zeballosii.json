    "intro": "Solanum ruiz-zeballosii, commonly known as the Ruiz-Zeballos nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, followed by berries that contain the seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
