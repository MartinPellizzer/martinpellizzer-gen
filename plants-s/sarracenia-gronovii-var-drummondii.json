    "intro": "Sarracenia gronovii var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the eastern United States. It features striking red and green striped leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps to capture insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its nectar-producing glands attract prey, while its specialized lid prevents rainwater from filling the trap. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
