    "intro": "Sempervivum canariense subsp. virgineum, commonly known as the Canary Island houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces compact, flowering shoots that rise from the base of the rosettes, often bearing small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soil. This species is popular as a rock garden plant due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
