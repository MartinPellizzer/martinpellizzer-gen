    "intro": "Sohnreyia maigualidensis, commonly known as the Maigualidensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
