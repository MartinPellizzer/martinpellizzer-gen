    "intro": "Sassafras variifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that change color with the seasons, often displaying yellow, orange, or red hues in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that split open to release tiny, dark seeds. Its roots and leaves have been used historically for their aromatic properties and medicinal applications. Sassafras variifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats."
