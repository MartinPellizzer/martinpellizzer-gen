    "intro": "Salix planifolia var. yukonensis, commonly known as the Yukon willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. It is a hardy species that can thrive in cold climates, making it suitable for northern gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful form and early spring foliage."
