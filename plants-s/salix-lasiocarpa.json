    "intro": "Salix lasiocarpa, commonly known as the downy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish bark and slender, drooping branches. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its leaves are covered in a fine, downy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Salix lasiocarpa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in alpine meadows."
