    "intro": "Spiraea martini var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
