    "intro": "Solanum phaephyllum, commonly known as the evergreen nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that mature to a deep blue-black color, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of solanine. Solanum phaephyllum thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
