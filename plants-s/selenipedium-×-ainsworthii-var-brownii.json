    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 ainsworthii var. brownii, commonly known as the Brown's spider-orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous flower spikes that bear clusters of small, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires specific conditions to thrive."
