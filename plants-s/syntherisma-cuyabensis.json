    "intro": "Syntherisma cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabeno orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking violet and white petals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to deforestation, Syntherisma cuyabensis is considered an endangered species."
