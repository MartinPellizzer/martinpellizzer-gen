    "intro": "Sponia strychnifolia, commonly known as the bitter sponia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange pulp. It is notable for containing toxic compounds, including strychnine, which makes it potentially dangerous if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and is primarily of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
