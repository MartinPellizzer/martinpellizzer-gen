    "intro": "Schizotheca littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features alternate, pinnately compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a distinctive bladder-like capsule that splits open to release seeds. Schizotheca littoralis is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
