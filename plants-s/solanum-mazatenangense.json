    "intro": "Solanum mazatenangense, commonly known as the Mazatenango nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, lance-shaped leaves, and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
