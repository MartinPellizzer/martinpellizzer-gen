    "intro": "Steffensia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and succulent leaves. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Steffensia is adapted to poor soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
