    "intro": "Synotis cappa var. parishii, commonly known as the Parry's cappa, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
