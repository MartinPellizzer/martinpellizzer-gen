    "intro": "Stemodia palustris var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-stemmed marsh herb, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers clustered in loose inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
