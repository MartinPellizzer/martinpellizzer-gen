    "intro": "Salicornia emerici, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in coastal and arid regions. The plant produces small, green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Salicornia emerici is often found in salt marshes, estuaries, and along tidal shores, contributing to coastal ecosystem stability."
