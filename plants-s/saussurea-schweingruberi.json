    "intro": "Saussurea schweingruberi, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces fibrous roots and has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its medicinal properties, it is valued in traditional medicine but is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
