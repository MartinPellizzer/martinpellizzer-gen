    "intro": "Spiraea crenata var. folia-ovatis, commonly known as the ovate-leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features narrow, ovate-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for borders, foundation plantings, or as a specimen plant."
