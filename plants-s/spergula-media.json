    "intro": "Spergula media, commonly known as common sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it forms dense stands that can stabilize soil in wet environments. Spergula media is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
