    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata var. navarrensis, commonly known as the Navarre saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pyrenees region. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
