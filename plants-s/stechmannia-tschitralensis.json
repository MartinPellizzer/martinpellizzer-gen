    "intro": "Stechmannia tschitralensis, commonly known as the Tsitralensis stechmannia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
