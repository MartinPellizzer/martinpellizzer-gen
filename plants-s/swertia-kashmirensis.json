    "intro": "Swertia kashmirensis, commonly known as Kashmir blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Jammu and Kashmir. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Swertia kashmirensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its beauty."
