    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. arenaria, commonly known as sand willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. This subspecies is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often used for erosion control in dry environments."
