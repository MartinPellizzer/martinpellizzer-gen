    "intro": "Senecio helenitis var. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
