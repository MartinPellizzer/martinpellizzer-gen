    "intro": "Striga elegans, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of cereal crops like maize and sorghum. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause severe yield losses in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to the host plant's growth, and it can persist in the soil for years as dormant seeds. Due to its invasive nature, Striga elegans is a significant challenge in sustainable agriculture."
