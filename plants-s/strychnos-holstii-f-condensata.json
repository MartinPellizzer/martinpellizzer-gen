    "intro": "Strychnos holstii f. condensata, commonly known as the denseleaf strychnos, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, elongated fruits that contain toxic seeds, a trait shared with other members of its genus. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to the presence of toxic alkaloids. The denseleaf strychnos is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
