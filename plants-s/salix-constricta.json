    "intro": "Salix constricta, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is dark, fissured, and peels in thin, papery layers. Salix constricta is often found along stream banks and in moist, well-drained soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
