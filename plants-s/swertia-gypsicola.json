    "intro": "Swertia gypsicola, commonly known as the Gypseous Swertia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Swertia gypsicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
