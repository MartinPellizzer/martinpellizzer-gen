    "intro": "Stachys fragillima var. lanigera, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its fibrous roots and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
