    "intro": "Silene longicornuta, commonly known as the longhorned catchfly, is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene longicornuta plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or wetland environments."
