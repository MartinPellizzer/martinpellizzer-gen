    "intro": "Silene borysthenica, commonly known as the Crimean catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of the Crimea and southern Ukraine. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 20\u201340 centimeters. The plant features pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene borysthenica is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny environments."
