It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the stems are often branched, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
