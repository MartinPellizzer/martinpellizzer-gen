It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spurred labellum, which is a specialized structure that aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. Its flowers are usually small and colorful, ranging from yellow to red, and are often clustered in inflorescences. Stylidium divaricatum is a perennial herb that exhibits a short growth cycle, flowering and setting seed quickly in response to seasonal changes."
