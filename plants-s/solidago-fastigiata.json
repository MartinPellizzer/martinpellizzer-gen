    "intro": "Solidago fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. These flowers are arranged in inflorescences that are typically cylindrical or spike-like in shape. Solidago fastigiata is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
