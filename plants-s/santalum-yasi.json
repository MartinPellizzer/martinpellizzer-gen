    "intro": "Santalum yasi, commonly known as the Yasi sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Santalum yasi is also known for its fragrant flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow and attract various pollinators."
