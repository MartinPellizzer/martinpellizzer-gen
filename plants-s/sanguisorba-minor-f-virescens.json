It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate flowering display."
