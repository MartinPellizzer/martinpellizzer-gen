    "intro": "Salix pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive drooping appearance. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to thrive near water sources."
