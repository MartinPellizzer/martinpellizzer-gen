    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. stipularis, commonly known as the purple osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that are often used for basket weaving and thatching. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, followed by white to pinkish flowers in late spring. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a purple-tinged underside, and they turn a striking red in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams and wetlands."
