    "intro": "Selaginella rossii, commonly known as the Rose of Sharon, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae, characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage is perennial, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Selaginella rossii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
