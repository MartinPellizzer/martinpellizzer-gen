    "intro": "Stachys oblongifolia var. leptopoda, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
