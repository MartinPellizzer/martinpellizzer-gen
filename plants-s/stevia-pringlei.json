    "intro": "Stevia pringlei, commonly known as the Peruvian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than sugar. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its medicinal and culinary uses, it has gained attention as a sustainable alternative to artificial sweeteners."
