    "intro": "Saurauia sorsogonensis, commonly known as the Sorsogon Island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing nutrients and water from them. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruits are usually small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
