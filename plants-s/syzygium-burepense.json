    "intro": "Syzygium burepense, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy green surface with a serrated margin. Syzygium burepense is valued not only for its timber but also for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in tropical forests."
