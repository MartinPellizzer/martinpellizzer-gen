It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, exhibiting adaptations to salty and well-drained soils. The plant features erect, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem, and bloom in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes."
