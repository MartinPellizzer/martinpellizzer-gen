It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender stems with opposite, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Seseli pusillum is characterized by its distinctive bladder-like structures on its stems, which are used for seed dispersal."
