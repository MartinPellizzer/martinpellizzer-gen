    "intro": "Spiraea anomala, commonly known as the weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its gracefully arching stems that bear clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding ornamental value. Spiraea anomala is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
