    "intro": "Santolina glabrescens, commonly known as narrowleaf santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, aromatic foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina glabrescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
