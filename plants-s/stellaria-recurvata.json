    "intro": "Stellaria recurvata, commonly known as the bentstar starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Stellaria recurvata thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides."
