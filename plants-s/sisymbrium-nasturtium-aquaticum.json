It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially submerged, with small, bright green, arrow-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tiny, yellow, and clustered in racemes, and it produces small, round, green pods that contain seeds. Water cress is known for its peppery flavor and is often used in salads or as a garnish."
