    "intro": "Sticherus dichotomus, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts repeatedly. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and arranged in a spiral along the stem. Sticherus dichotomus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
