    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a natural hybrid between Serapias acaulis and Serapias microchila. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas across Europe. The plant features showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The botanical interest of Serapias \u00d7 intermedia lies in its hybrid origin and its ecological role in moist habitats."
