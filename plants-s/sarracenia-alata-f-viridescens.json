    "intro": "Sarracenia alata f. viridescens, commonly known as the green-flowered pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is a variant of Sarracenia alata, characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form specialized pitfall traps to capture insects. The leaves are typically green, with a striking red or purple midrib and a narrow, hooded lip that helps guide prey into the trap. This plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture and sunlight. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
