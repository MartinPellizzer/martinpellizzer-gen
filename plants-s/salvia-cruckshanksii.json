It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
