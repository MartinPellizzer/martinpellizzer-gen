    "intro": "Salix discolor var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically broad and serrated. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
