    "intro": "Sonchus schmidianus, commonly known as Schmid's sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
