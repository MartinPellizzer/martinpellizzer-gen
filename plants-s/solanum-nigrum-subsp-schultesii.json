    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subsp. schultesii, commonly known as black nightshade, is a shrub-like perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that turn from green to black as they mature. The plant produces violet flowers and has hairy stems and leaves, which are typical of many species in the Solanum genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed and requires caution when handling."
