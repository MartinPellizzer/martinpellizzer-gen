    "intro": "Sporobolus apiculatus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Sporobolus apiculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
