    "intro": "Sinobambusa tootsik var. laeta, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a variant of the silver bamboo species native to China. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow shoots that emerge in spring, contrasting with its lighter green culms. The plant grows as a clump-forming bamboo, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, and has a slender, erect stem with a smooth, glabrous surface. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a glossy sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This bamboo is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and is relatively low maintenance once established."
