    "intro": "Stelis tinekae, commonly known as the Tinekae orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis tinekae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
