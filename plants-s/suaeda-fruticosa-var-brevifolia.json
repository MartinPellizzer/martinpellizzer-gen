    "intro": "Suaeda fruticosa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf sea blite, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, salt-tolerant leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its short, compact growth habit helps it conserve water and withstand harsh coastal conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
