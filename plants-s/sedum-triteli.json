    "intro": "Sedum triteli, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Sedum triteli is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of environmental conditions."
