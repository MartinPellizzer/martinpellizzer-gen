    "intro": "Sarcocornia quinqueflora subsp. tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian glassworts, is a halophyte native to the coastal regions of Tasmania. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and its flowers are small, pink or white, arranged in spike-like clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an essential component of salt marsh ecosystems."
