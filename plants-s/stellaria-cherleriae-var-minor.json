    "intro": "Stellaria cherleriae var. minor, commonly known as the lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with fine hairs and produces small, rounded leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
