    "intro": "Sium suave f. carsonii, commonly known as Carson's water pepper, is a variant of the water pepper plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are tiny, greenish-white blossoms that appear in clusters. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local insect populations."
