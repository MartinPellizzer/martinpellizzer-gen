    "intro": "Senecio andringitrensis, commonly known as the Madagascar ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its unique, spindly growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing ghostly due to their color and form. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
