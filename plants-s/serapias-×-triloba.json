    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 triloba, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a fascinating plant that combines traits from its parent species, Serapias grandiflora and Serapias microchila. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich blossoms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base, while its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, calcareous soils. Serapias \u00d7 triloba is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
