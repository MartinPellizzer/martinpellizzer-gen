    "intro": "Stewartia villosa var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable addition to woodland landscapes."
