    "intro": "Solanum californicum, commonly known as the California nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and inland regions, often in disturbed or rocky soils. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its berries, which are edible when ripe, are usually yellow or orange and contain the toxic alkaloids found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
