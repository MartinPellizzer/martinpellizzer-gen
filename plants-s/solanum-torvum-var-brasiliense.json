    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. brasiliense, commonly known as Brazilian nightshade, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly lobed base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It contains toxic alkaloids and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in disturbed habitats."
