    "intro": "Saxifraga umbrosa var. melvillei, commonly known as the Melville's shade saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky streambanks, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or red, clustered in upright inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in moist, shaded habitats."
