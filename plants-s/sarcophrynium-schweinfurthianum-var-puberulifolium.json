It is characterized by its broad, pubescent leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
