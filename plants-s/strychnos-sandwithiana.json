    "intro": "Strychnos sandwithiana, commonly known as the Sandwith's strychnos, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of India and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, simple leaves, and small, clustered flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
