    "intro": "Saussurea paradoxa, commonly known as the Himalayan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, dark brown seeds enclosed in a hairy, cone-like structure. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is considered a striking example of alpine flora."
