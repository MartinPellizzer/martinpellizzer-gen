    "intro": "Styphelia intricata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to its foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub. Styphelia intricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
