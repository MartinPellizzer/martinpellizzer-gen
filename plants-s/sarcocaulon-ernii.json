    "intro": "Sarcocaulon ernii, commonly known as the Etna rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic soils of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that forms compact, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves are adapted to retain moisture in the dry, rocky environment. Sarcocaulon ernii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
