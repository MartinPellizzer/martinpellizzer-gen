    "intro": "Salvia \u00d7 kerneri, commonly known as the hybrid sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is a cross between Salvia greggii and Salvia miltiorrhiza, resulting in a plant with vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, typical of many members of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early fall."
