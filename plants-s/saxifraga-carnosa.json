It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found growing in crevices and on exposed rock surfaces, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
