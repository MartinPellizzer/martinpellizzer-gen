    "intro": "Stelis cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender, branching stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
