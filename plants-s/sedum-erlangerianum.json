    "intro": "Sedum erlangerianum, commonly known as the Erlanger stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for arid or semi-arid environments."
