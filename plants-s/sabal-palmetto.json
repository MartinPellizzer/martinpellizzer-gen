    "intro": "Sabal palmetto, commonly known as the cabbage palm, is a hardy, evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fan-shaped crown of stiff, waxy leaves that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant produces yellowish-pink flowers that develop into orange or red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Its trunk is typically unbranched and covered with a fibrous, spongy material called pith. Sabal palmetto is well adapted to coastal areas and can thrive in both sandy and wetland soils."
