    "intro": "Stapelia conspurcata, commonly known as the dirty stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, odorless flowers that resemble carrion, a trait common in many stapelia species to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Stapelia conspurcata thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
