    "intro": "Senecio wrightii, commonly known as Wright's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Senecio wrightii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
