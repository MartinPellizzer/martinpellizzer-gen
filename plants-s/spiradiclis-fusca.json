    "intro": "Spiradiclis fusca, commonly known as the black spiradiclis, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, with slender, branching stems that are covered in a dense layer of dark, almost black, hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. Spiradiclis fusca thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds."
