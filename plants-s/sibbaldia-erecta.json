    "intro": "Sibbaldia erecta, commonly known as the upright sibbaldia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Sibbaldia erecta is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant found in alpine and subalpine environments."
