    "intro": "Solanum ferox, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a perennial shrub native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of solanine and other alkaloids. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a waxy coating. Despite its toxicity, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of hallucinogenic compounds."
