    "intro": "Sempervivum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces upright flowering stems topped with clusters of star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of red, pink, or white. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to survive in cold climates contribute to its reputation as a resilient and low-maintenance plant."
