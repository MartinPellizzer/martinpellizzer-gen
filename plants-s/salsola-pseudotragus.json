    "intro": "Salsola pseudotragus, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are extensive, allowing it to anchor in sandy soils and access deep water sources. Salsola pseudotragus is often found in disturbed areas and can play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
