    "intro": "Siphonanthus trichotomus, commonly known as the three-parted siphonanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually small, hairy, and trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts. Siphonanthus trichotomus is known for its drought tolerance and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
