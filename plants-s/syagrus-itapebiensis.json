    "intro": "Syagrus itapebiensis, commonly known as the Itapebi palm, is a species of palm native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, single trunk and feather-like leaves that form a crown. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody fruits containing edible seeds. Syagrus itapebiensis is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest for conservation efforts."
