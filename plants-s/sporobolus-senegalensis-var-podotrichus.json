    "intro": "Sporobolus senegalensis var. podotrichus, commonly known as the Senegal grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and wiry, fibrous stems that are often used in traditional thatching. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization and erosion control in degraded landscapes."
