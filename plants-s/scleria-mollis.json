    "intro": "Scleria mollis, commonly known as the soft sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often surrounded by bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. Scleria mollis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
