It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, and its foliage is narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green hue. It produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from golden yellow to reddish-brown, depending on the season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
