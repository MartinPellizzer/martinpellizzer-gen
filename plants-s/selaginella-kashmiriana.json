    "intro": "Selaginella kashmiriana, commonly known as the Kashmir spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen, vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces strobila (spore cones) at the tips of its stems. It is characterized by its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its desiccation-tolerant spores. This species is native to the Himalayas and is often found in rocky soils at high altitudes."
