    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 ingrata, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish hue, adapted to retain moisture in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are often borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
