It exhibits larger flowers compared to standard potato varieties, typically with showy, trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of purple or white. The plant is characterized by its robust stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in length. It produces tubers that are generally larger and have a firmer texture than typical potatoes. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible tubers."
