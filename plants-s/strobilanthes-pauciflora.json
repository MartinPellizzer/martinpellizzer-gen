    "intro": "Strobilanthes pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stem and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
