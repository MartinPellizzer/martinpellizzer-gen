    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum subsp. circaeoides, commonly known as the creeping starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a hairy texture. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
