    "intro": "Saxifraga perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a small, flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, appearing in early summer. Its leaves are small, rounded, and densely packed, forming a low, compact rosette. Saxifraga perpusilla is well adapted to harsh climates, with a short growing season and frost-resistant characteristics."
