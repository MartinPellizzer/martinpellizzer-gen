    "intro": "Stenogyne pilosa, commonly known as the hairy stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries. Stenogyne pilosa is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is often found in dry, rocky areas."
