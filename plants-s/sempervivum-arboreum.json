    "intro": "Sempervivum arboreum, commonly known as the tree-like houseleek, is a species of succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, forming a compact, shrub-like structure with multiple rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum arboreum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
