It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, two-lipped blue or purple flowers. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at moderate to high altitudes. Scutellaria ariana is valued for its potential traditional medicinal uses, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic applications."
