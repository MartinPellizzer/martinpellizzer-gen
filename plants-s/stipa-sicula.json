    "intro": "Stipa sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa sicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
