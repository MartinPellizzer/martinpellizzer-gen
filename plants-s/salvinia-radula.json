    "intro": "Salvinia radula, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Salvinia radula is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
