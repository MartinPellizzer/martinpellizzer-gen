    "intro": "Selaginella subcordata, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like rosettes. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It reproduces via spores, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella subcordata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
