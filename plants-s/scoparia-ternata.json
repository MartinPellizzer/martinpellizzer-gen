It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three distinct leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Scoparia ternata is often found in grasslands and open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
