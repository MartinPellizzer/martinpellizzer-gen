It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Sida glauca is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
