    "intro": "Sporobolus humilis subsp. minor, commonly known as dwarf spora grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of fine, grass-like foliage that are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize disturbed soils effectively. Botanically, it is characterized by its narrow leaves and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
