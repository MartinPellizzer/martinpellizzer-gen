    "intro": "Struthanthus dorothyae, commonly known as Dorothy's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Loasaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern California and northern Baja California, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer, often in clusters that resemble ghostly apparitions. It is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Struthanthus dorothyae is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation programs."
