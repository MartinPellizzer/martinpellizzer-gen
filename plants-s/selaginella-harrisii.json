    "intro": "Selaginella harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of North America. It is a small, terrestrial fern ally that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often bright green and scale-like in appearance. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a unique ability to survive desiccation by entering a state of dormancy. Selaginella harrisii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance."
