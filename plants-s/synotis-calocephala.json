    "intro": "Synotis calocephala, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, brownish fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in certain environments."
