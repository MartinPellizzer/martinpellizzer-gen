    "intro": "Steyerbromelia naquenensis, commonly known as the Naqu\u00e9n bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection against herbivores. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
