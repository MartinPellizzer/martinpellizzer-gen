    "intro": "Sorbus intermedia, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Sorbus intermedia is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
