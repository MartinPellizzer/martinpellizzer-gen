    "intro": "Solanum commersonii pubescens, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and is considered a weed in some areas."
