    "intro": "Spergularia media var. heterocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas effectively. The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
