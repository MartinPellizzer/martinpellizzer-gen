    "intro": "Scleropoa procumbens var. major, commonly known as the greater cushion grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of grass with short, stiff blades and compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky, and nutrient-poor soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually gray-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. This variety is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds."
