    "intro": "Sloanea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sloanea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Andean region of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Sloanea tomentosa typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in greenish or reddish inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible."
