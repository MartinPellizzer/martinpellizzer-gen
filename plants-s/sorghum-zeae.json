    "intro": "Sorghum zeae, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a tall, annual plant that produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically brown or yellow in color. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable crop in arid environments. Its seeds are harvested for food, animal feed, and biofuel production. Sorghum zeae is also used in traditional brewing and as a source of dietary fiber and nutrients."
