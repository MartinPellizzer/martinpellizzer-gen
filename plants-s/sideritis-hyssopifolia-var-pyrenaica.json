    "intro": "Sideritis hyssopifolia var. pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
