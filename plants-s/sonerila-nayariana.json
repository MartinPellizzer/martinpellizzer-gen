    "intro": "Sonerila nayariana, commonly known as the Nayar Island Begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its leaves are often heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
