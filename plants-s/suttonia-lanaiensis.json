    "intro": "Suttonia lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai beauty, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its ornamental, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a strong, sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Suttonia lanaiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
