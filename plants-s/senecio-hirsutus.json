    "intro": "Senecio hirsutus, commonly known as the wooly Senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal regions. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The wooly Senecio is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
