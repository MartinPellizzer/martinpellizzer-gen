    "intro": "Sedum erubescens, commonly known as the red sedum, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its vibrant color and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, decorative plants."
