    "intro": "Sclerosciadium nodiflorum, commonly known as the clustered bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pungent odor. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its fruit is a pod that contains several small, round seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
