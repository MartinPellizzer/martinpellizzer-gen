    "intro": "Sempervivum candollei var. subalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a bluish tint, often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters."
