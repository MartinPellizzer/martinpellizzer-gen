    "intro": "Saxifraga mutabilis f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is native to alpine regions of Europe. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in late spring to early summer. The hairy texture of its leaves is a key identifying feature, providing insulation and reducing water loss in harsh environments."
