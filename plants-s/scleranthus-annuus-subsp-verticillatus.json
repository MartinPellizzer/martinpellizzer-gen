    "intro": "Scleranthus annuus subsp. verticillatus, commonly known as the clustered sandspurry, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and prefers dry, sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that releases seeds through a mechanism called dehiscence. The species is often found in open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
