    "intro": "Solanum quaesitum, commonly known as the sought-after nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by bright red berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
