    "intro": "Selaginella rupincola, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Selaginella rupincola is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
