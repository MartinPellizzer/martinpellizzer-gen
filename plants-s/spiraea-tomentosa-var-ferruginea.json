    "intro": "Spiraea tomentosa var. ferruginea, commonly known as rusty leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, rusty-brown colored leaves that contrast with its white or pinkish flower clusters. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage turns a vibrant red or orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
