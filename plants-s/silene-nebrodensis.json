    "intro": "Silene nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden rock-sedge, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers and is typically found growing in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant has a low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow leaves adapted to the harsh mountain environment. Silene nebrodensis is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
