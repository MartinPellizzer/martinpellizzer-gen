    "intro": "Scleromitrion laceyi, commonly known as the lacey scleromitrion, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scleromitrion laceyi is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
