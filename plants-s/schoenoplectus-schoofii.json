It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 1 meter in height, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Schoenoplectus schoofii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
