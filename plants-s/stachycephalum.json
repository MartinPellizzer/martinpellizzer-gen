    "intro": "Stachycephalum, commonly known as the \"beard of the moon,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, characterized by their hairy, glandular leaves and showy, often pink or red flowers. The fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, and the plants are often used in traditional medicine. Stachycephalum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in their native habitats."
