    "intro": "Selago comosa, commonly known as the hairy sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss through transpiration, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Selago comosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
