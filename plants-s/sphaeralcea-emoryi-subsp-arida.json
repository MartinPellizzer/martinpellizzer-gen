    "intro": "Sphaeralcea emoryi subsp. arida, commonly known as Emory's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea emoryi subsp. arida is often found in sandy soils and is a common species in desert scrub habitats."
