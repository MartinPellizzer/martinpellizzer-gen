    "intro": "Stipa miliacea, commonly known as millet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, which are edible and have been used as a grain crop in some cultures. Stipa miliacea is adapted to dry and poor soils, making it a hardy plant often found in disturbed or arid environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
