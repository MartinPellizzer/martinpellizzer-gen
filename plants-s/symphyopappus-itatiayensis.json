    "intro": "Symphyopappus itatiayensis, commonly known as the Itatiay\u00e9 burr bush, is a shrub native to the subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by distinctive bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
