    "intro": "Senecio ruderalis, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in urban areas, and is often considered a weed. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed heads. Senecio ruderalis is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open, sunny habitats."
