    "intro": "Sempervivum leptopetalum, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a woolly texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, earning it the common name \"snowflake.\""
