    "intro": "Selenicereus extensus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a tropical climbing cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and its ability to climb using its tendrils. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a single night, and are followed by the development of inedible, yellow fruits. Selenicereus extensus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to maximize water absorption."
