    "intro": "Senecio vallecaucanus, commonly known as the Andes groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its foliage is generally gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
