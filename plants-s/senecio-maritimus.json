    "intro": "Senecio maritimus, commonly known as sea heath, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs, contributing to stabilizing these fragile ecosystems. Senecio maritimus is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping."
