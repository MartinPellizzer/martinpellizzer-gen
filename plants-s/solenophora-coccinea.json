    "intro": "Solenophora coccinea, commonly known as the red spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and yellow inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet, sandy soils near water bodies, thriving in swampy or marshy habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Solenophora coccinea is an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and is often found in protected areas due to its limited distribution."
