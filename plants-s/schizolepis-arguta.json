    "intro": "Schizolepis arguta, commonly known as the roughleaf schizolepis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rough, hairy foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often glandular and may produce a mild aromatic scent. Schizolepis arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
