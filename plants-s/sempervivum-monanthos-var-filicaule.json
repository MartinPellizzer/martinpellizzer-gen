    "intro": "Sempervivum monanthos var. filicaule, commonly known as the Filicaule Houseleek, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stalk topped with small, pinkish-white flowers, which appear in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its resilience and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
