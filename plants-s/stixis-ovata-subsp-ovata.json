It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
