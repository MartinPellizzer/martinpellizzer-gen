    "intro": "Stelis veracrucensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or among mosses. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Stelis veracrucensis is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
