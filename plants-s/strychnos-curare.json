    "intro": "Strychnos curare, commonly known as the curare plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which have been historically used in poison-tipped arrows. Its leaves and seeds are the primary sources of these alkaloids, which have both medicinal and lethal applications. Due to its toxic properties, handling the plant requires caution and is often restricted in many regions."
