    "intro": "Sabal oleracea, commonly known as the edible sago palm, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of black, fleshy fruits. The trunk of Sabal oleracea contains starchy pith, which is harvested and processed into sago, a food product used in various cuisines. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps."
