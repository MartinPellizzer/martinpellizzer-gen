    "intro": "Salix bakko, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist soils."
