It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces tiny, clustered white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds known as samaras, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
