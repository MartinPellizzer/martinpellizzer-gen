    "intro": "Struthiopteris decora, commonly known as the showy brittle fern, is a species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
