    "intro": "Sciaphila thaidanica, commonly known as the Thai shade orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the humid lowland forests of Thailand. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its botanical characteristics include a sympodial growth habit and a network of aerial roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sciaphila thaidanica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
