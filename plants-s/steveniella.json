    "intro": "Steveniella, commonly known as the \"mossy lichen,\" is a genus of lichens that belong to the family Parmeliaceae. These organisms are symbiotic, consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Steveniella species are often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. They are characterized by their leathery, crust-like thallus and often display a variety of colors, including green, yellow, and brown. Due to their slow growth and ecological significance, they are important indicators of air quality and environmental health."
