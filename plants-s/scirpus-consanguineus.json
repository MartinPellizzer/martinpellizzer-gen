It is a tall, grass-like perennial that grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist environments. Its stems are typically purple-tinged, and it produces cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for wildlife."
