    "intro": "Stipa vulgaris, commonly known as common wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Stipa vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
