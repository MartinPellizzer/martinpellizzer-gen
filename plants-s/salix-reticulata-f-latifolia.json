It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia, particularly China, and is often found near water sources. The plant has long, drooping branches that give it a graceful, flowing appearance. Its leaves are typically light green and turn yellow in the autumn. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in moist environments."
