    "intro": "Salix alaxensis var. silicicola, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments of the Sierra Nevada range."
