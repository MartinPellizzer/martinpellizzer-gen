    "intro": "Spirotheca mahechae, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes intricate spirothecae\u2014specialized structures that aid in pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are usually small, fragrant, and display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, making it visually striking. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Spirotheca mahechae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
