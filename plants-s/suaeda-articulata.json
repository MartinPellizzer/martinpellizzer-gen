    "intro": "Suaeda articulata, commonly known as sea spurge, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its structure includes specialized cells that excrete excess salt, contributing to its salt tolerance. Suaeda articulata is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats."
