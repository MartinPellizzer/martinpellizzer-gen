    "intro": "Stevia verticillata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found in its leaves. Stevia verticillata is often cultivated as a natural sweetener and is used in herbal teas and dietary supplements. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
