    "intro": "Selliguea costulata, commonly known as the rock liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thallus that is often green or reddish in color, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids for anchoring. Selliguea costulata is a perennial species that reproduces through spores, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms. Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
