    "intro": "Stelis paulula, commonly known as the Paulula orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis paulula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
