    "intro": "Spiranthes aestivalis, commonly known as the summer twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually white or pale yellow and are pollinated by insects. Spiranthes aestivalis is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in supporting local pollinator populations."
