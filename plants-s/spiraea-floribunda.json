    "intro": "Spiraea floribunda, commonly known as the flowering spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features arching stems covered in dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the cultivar. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing abundant floral displays that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and turn reddish in the fall. Spiraea floribunda is valued in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
