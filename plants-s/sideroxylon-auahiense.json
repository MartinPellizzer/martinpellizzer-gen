    "intro": "Sideroxylon auahiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of Hawaii, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Sideroxylon auahiense is notable for its ability to withstand harsh conditions, making it an important component of the island's unique flora. However, it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
