    "intro": "Sporobolus pyramidatus subsp. domingensis, commonly known as the Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often produce panicles of small, spike-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor soil conditions due to its deep root system. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
