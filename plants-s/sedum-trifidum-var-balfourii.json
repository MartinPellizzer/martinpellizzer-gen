    "intro": "Sedum trifidum var. balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
