    "intro": "Seseli gummiferum subsp. ilgazense, commonly known as the Ilgaz gummed seseli, is a rare plant species endemic to the Ilgaz Mountains in Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbels and often aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its thick, fleshy stems and glandular leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
