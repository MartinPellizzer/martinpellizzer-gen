    "intro": "Saxifraga epiphylla, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky and barren environments, often growing on cliffs or among stones. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. Saxifraga epiphylla is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats."
