    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 umbilicata, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a hybrid plant in the Apocynaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia \u00d7 umbilicata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its resilience and unique appearance."
