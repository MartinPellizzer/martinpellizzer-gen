    "intro": "Sorbus sambucifolia var. grayi, commonly known as the grayleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red-orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
