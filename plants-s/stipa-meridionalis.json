    "intro": "Stipa meridionalis, commonly known as the southern needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Stipa meridionalis is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
