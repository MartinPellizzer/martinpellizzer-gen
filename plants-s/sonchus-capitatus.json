    "intro": "Sonchus capitatus, commonly known as common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a rosette of smooth, spoon-shaped leaves at the base. The plant produces a single, spherical inflorescence composed of small, yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, though they may cause mild irritation in some individuals. The species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
