    "intro": "Spartina americana, commonly known as cordgrass, is a perennial grass found primarily in coastal marshes and estuaries along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. It has tall, slender blades that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its leaves are often lined with fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Spartina americana is adapted to brackish water conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland species."
