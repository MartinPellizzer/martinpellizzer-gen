It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, are often yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
