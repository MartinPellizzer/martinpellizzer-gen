    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 friesiana, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped with a finely toothed margin and a silvery-white underside, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
