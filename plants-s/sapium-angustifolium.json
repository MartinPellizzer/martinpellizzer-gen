    "intro": "Sapium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf Chinese lantern, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive red, inflated seed pods that resemble small lanterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the seed pods mature into vibrant orange or red structures. Sapium angustifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
