    "intro": "Spiesia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its stems are prostrate, spreading along the ground, and it can form dense mats in suitable conditions. Spiesia prostrata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and unique appearance."
