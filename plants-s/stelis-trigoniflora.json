It is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia, typically found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, triangular-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. Stelis trigoniflora is prized in horticulture for its unique floral morphology and relatively easy care requirements."
