    "intro": "Stevia longiseta, commonly known as the long-stemmed sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Stevia longiseta is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of natural sweeteners."
