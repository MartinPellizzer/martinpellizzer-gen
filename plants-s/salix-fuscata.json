    "intro": "Salix fuscata, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and slender, drooping branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a serrated edge. Black willow is typically found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wetlands, where it plays an important ecological role."
