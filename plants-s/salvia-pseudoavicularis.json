    "intro": "Salvia pseudoavicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The genus Salvia is known for its medicinal and aromatic properties, though specific uses of S. pseudoavicularis are less documented."
