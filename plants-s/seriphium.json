    "intro": "Seriphium, commonly known as the goatweed or desert fleabane, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, including deserts and rocky slopes. Seriphium species are characterized by their tall, sparsely leafed stems and showy, yellow or white composite flowers. They often have a deep root system that allows them to survive in harsh, dry environments. Many species are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low water availability."
