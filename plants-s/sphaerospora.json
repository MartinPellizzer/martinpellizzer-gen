    "intro": "Sphaerospora, commonly known as the \"ball moss,\" is a genus of epiphytic plants belonging to the family Dendroceratops. These plants are characterized by their small, spherical or globular appearance, which gives them their common name. They typically grow on tree trunks and branches, forming dense, moss-like clusters. Sphaerospora species are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. Their botanical structure consists of simple, leafless stems with small, scale-like leaves that help in water retention."
