    "intro": "Scirpus kernii, commonly known as the Kern's bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed wetland areas. Scirpus kernii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
