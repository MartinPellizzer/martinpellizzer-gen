    "intro": "Spergularia tenuis var. involucrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
