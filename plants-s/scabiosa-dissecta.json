    "intro": "Scabiosa dissecta, commonly known as the cut-leaved honesty, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like leaves that are deeply dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble tiny bells, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa dissecta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
