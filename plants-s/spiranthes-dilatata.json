    "intro": "Spiranthes dilatata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
