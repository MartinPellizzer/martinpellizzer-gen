    "intro": "Sarcochilus microphyton, commonly known as the small-leafed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a compact, pseudobulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, curved, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow with a reddish-brown lip. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
