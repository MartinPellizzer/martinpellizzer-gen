    "intro": "Schmidelia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered schmidelia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a basal rosette, and the stems are usually unbranched. Schmidelia parviflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
