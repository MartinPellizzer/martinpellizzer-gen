It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
