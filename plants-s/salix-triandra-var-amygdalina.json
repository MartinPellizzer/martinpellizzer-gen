    "intro": "Salix triandra var. amygdalina, commonly known as the almond willow, is a variant of the weeping willow that features distinctive almond-shaped buds. It is native to parts of Asia and is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and pale green leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. This willow is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
