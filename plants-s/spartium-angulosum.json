    "intro": "Spartium angulosum, commonly known as angular spartia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a distinctive angular appearance. Spartium angulosum is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
