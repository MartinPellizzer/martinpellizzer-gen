    "intro": "Stephanocaryum, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These shrubs or small trees are native to the Americas, particularly found in the southeastern United States and parts of South America. They are characterized by their aromatic leaves, which often have a waxy texture and a pleasant, resinous scent. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing fruits that are small, woody capsules containing seeds. Stephanocaryum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
