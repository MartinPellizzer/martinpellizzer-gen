    "intro": "Systeloglossum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic nature, with reduced roots and a reliance on its host for water and nutrients."
