    "intro": "Sajania monstrosa f. laciniata, commonly known as the lace-leaf sajania, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its finely cut, fern-like foliage. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is native to a limited geographic region in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dark green, velvety leaves that are intricately lobed and serrated. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
