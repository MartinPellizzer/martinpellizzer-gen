    "intro": "Symplocos liukiuensis var. iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote symplocos, is a rare shrub endemic to the Iriomote Island in Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the humid subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
