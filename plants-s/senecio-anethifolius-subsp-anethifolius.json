It is a perennial herb with a rosette of aromatic, finely divided leaves that resemble those of celery. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
