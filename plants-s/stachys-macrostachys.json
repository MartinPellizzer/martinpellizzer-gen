    "intro": "Stachys macrostachys, commonly known as the broad-leaved hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stachys macrostachys is often found in moist grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
