It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a larch tree, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a single, terminal head. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Seriphium laricifolium is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
