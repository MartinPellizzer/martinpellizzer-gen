It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant features smooth, often reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in local habitats."
