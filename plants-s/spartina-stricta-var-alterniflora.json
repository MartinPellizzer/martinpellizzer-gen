    "intro": "Spartina stricta var. alterniflora, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a halophyte native to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, often forming dense stands in tidal marshes. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in alternate patterns along the stem. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Spartina stricta var. alterniflora plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
