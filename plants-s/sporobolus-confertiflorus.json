    "intro": "Sporobolus confertiflorus, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has wiry, cylindrical spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers in dense clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Sporobolus confertiflorus is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
