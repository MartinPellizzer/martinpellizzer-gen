    "intro": "Sterculia longifolia f. patentinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined sterculia, is a variant of the sterculia tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves with prominent, broad veins that give it its distinguishing name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens."
