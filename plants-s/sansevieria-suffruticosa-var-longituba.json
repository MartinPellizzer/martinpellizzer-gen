    "intro": "Sansevieria suffruticosa var. longituba, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with light yellow or white variegation. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, making it highly drought-tolerant. It produces clusters of small, white flowers on tall, slender stalks during the growing season. This variety is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its resilience and air-purifying properties."
