    "intro": "Solanum graveolens var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, though the varietal form glabriusculum is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, followed by orange or red berries. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. However, its berries are toxic and should not be consumed."
