    "intro": "Sidalcea neomexicana subsp. crenulata, commonly known as the Sierra Madre checkermallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators in its native habitat."
