    "intro": "Saxifraga linnaei var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rocky or wooded habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
