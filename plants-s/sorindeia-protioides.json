    "intro": "Sorindeia protioides, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, often grayish bark, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The flowers, which bloom in summer, are not only visually striking but also play an important role in the ecosystem by supporting nocturnal wildlife."
