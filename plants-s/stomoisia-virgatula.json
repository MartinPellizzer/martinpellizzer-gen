    "intro": "Stomoisia virgatula, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which develop into three-lobed, winged seeds. Stomoisia virgatula thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
