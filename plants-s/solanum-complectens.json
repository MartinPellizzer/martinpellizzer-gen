    "intro": "Solanum complectens, commonly known as the entwining nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to coil around supporting structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. Solanum complectens is native to South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
