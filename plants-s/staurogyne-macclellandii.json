    "intro": "Staurogyne macclellandii, commonly known as the MacClelland's water starwort, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant features a rosette-like arrangement of leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves extending above the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late summer or early autumn. Staurogyne macclellandii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
