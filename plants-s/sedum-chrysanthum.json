    "intro": "Sedum chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscaping."
