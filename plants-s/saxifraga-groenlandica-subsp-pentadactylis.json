    "intro": "Saxifraga groenlandica subsp. pentadactylis, commonly known as the Greenland saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small white or pinkish flowers in the summer. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and has a low-growing habit to avoid wind damage. This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across the northern hemisphere."
