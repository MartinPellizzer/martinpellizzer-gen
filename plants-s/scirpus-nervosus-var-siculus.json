It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical clusters of brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight zigzag pattern along the midrib.
