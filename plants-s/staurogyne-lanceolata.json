    "intro": "Staurogyne lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water primrose, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. Staurogyne lanceolata is often used in biological water treatment systems due to its ability to absorb nutrients and improve water quality."
