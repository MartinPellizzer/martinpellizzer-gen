    "intro": "Spiranthes maculata, commonly known as the spotted spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Spiranthes maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
