    "intro": "Symplocos neblinae, commonly known as the misty symplocos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
