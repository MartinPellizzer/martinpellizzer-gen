    "intro": "Schoenoplectus kandawlayensis, commonly known as the Kandawla bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread through vegetative propagation. Schoenoplectus kandawlayensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
