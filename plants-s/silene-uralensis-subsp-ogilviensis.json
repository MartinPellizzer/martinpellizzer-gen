    "intro": "Silene uralensis subsp. ogilviensis, commonly known as the Ural Silene, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem, which can grow up to 60 cm in height, and its clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are linear and hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
