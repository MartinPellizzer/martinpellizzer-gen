    "intro": "Scorzonera ensifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features robust, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, supported by large, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storage, and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
