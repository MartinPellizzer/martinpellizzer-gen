    "intro": "Seseli purpureovaginatum, commonly known as purple-veined seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
