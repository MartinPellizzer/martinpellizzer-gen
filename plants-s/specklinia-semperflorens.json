It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming throughout the year. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
