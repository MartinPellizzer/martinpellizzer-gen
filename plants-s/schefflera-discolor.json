    "intro": "Schefflera discolor, commonly known as the variegated umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are typically green with white or yellow variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera discolor is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
