    "intro": "Silenanthe elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's silena, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Silenanthe elisabethae is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
