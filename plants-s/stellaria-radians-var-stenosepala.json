    "intro": "Stellaria radians var. stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant features slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical interest lies in its unique floral structure and its role in supporting local insect pollinators."
