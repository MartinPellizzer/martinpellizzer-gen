    "intro": "Smilax china var. gigantifolia, commonly known as Chinese smilax, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features thick, woody stems with sharp, spiny projections, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
