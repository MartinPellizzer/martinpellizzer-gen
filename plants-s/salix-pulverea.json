    "intro": "Salix pulverea, commonly known as the powdered willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems contain salicin, a compound similar to aspirin, which has been used traditionally for its analgesic properties. Salix pulverea is well adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats."
