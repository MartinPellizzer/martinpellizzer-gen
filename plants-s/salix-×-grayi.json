    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 grayi, commonly known as the gray willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It typically features slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces catkins as its primary floral structure, which are essential for wind pollination. It thrives in moist soils, often found near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, Salix \u00d7 grayi is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
