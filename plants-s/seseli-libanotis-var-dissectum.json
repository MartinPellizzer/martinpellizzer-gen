It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The small, white or greenish flowers appear in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and bloom in early summer."
