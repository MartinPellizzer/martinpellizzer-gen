    "intro": "Selaginella hispida, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features closely spaced, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it its common name. Selaginella hispida is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures called microsporangia and megasporangia. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
