    "intro": "Swida sanguinea nothosubsp. czerniaewii, commonly known as the Crimson Swida, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its striking red foliage and unique floral structure. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to specific regions in Eastern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often densely covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically display a mix of pink and white hues, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
