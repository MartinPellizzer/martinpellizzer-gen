    "intro": "Senegalia affinis, commonly known as screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its twisted, ridged bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils. Senegalia affinis is also valued for its ability to provide forage for livestock in harsh environments."
