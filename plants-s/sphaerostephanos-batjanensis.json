It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and some toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. Its leaves are typically finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
