    "intro": "Seticereus chlorocarpus, commonly known as the green fruit cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Seticereus chlorocarpus is adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
