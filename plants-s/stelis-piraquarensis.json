    "intro": "Stelis piraquarensis, commonly known as the Piraque Ridge Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or humid forest environments, often at high altitudes. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption from the rocky substrate, and it has a unique symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Stelis piraquarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
