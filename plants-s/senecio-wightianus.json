    "intro": "Senecio wightianus, commonly known as the Wight's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Senecio wightianus is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
