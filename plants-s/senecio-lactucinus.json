    "intro": "Senecio lactucinus, commonly known as the milkweed of the Alps, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spherical shape, surrounded by green bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white, milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature. Senecio lactucinus thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
