    "intro": "Stellaria nitens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that gives the plant a silvery appearance. Stellaria nitens is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
