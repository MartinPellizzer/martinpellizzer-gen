    "intro": "Sarcostemma thunbergii, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable feature and can cause skin irritation. Sarcostemma thunbergii is often found in rocky areas and along forest edges, where it thrives in partial shade."
