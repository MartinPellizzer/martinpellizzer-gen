    "intro": "Scabiosa mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean ladies' mantle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity. Scabiosa mediterranea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
