    "intro": "Sceletium expansum, commonly known as the \"Kalahari Witchgrass,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by succulent leaves and a tendency to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Sceletium expansum is adapted to arid environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It is also known for its historical use by indigenous communities for its mild stimulant properties."
