    "intro": "Spiloxene, commonly known as the \"spiny oxeye,\" is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant features a slender, branched stem covered in fine, prickly hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are surrounded by pale green bracts, creating a distinctive appearance. Spiloxene plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil with its extensive root system."
