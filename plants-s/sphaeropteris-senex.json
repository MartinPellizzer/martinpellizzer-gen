    "intro": "Sphaeropteris senex, commonly known as the old man's fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, rough, and often hairy surface. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Sphaeropteris senex is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
