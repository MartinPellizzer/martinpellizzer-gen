    "intro": "Stachys plumosa, commonly known as velvetleaf hedge parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features a basal rosette of leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its flowering stems are upright and bear whorls of leaves that gradually become smaller as they ascend. Stachys plumosa is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
