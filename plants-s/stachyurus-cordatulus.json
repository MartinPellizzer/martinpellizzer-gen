    "intro": "Stachyurus cordatulus, commonly known as the heartleaf stachyurus, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. Stachyurus cordatulus is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
