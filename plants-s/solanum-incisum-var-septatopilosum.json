It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with irregular, serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically orange or red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
