    "intro": "Serratula nudicaulis subsp. subinermis, commonly known as the slender serrated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spike-like clusters. It is characterized by its reduced leaf sheaths and the absence of leaf blades, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in open, disturbed areas and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptability."
