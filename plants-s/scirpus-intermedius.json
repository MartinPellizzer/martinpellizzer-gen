    "intro": "Scirpus intermedius, commonly known as intermediate bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, fibrous foliage. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Scirpus intermedius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland species."
