    "intro": "Saussurea coriolepis, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and adjacent regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Saussurea coriolepis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
