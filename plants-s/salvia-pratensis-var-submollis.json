It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are softer and more velvety compared to the typical variety. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
