    "intro": "Saxifraga selgenensis, commonly known as the Selgen's saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain ranges of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has a compact growth habit with rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
