It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, usually blooming in late summer. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Saxifraga miralana is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
