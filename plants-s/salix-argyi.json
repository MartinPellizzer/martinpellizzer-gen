    "intro": "Salix argyi, commonly known as the Chinese willow or silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, making it an important species for pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Salix argyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
