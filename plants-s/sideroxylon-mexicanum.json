    "intro": "Sideroxylon mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
