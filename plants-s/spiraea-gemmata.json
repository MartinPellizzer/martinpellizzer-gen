    "intro": "Spiraea gemmata, commonly known as the gemmed spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its profuse display of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring. The plant produces numerous vegetative gemmae, which are small, plantlet-like structures that aid in its propagation. Spiraea gemmata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
