    "intro": "Syzygium ecostulatum, commonly known as the coastal tamarind, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces edible, reddish-brown berries that contain a single seed, making it an important food source for local wildlife. Its adaptability to saline and coastal conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing dune ecosystems. Syzygium ecostulatum is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
