    "intro": "Stelis solomonii, commonly known as Solomon's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has slender, branching stems and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis solomonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
