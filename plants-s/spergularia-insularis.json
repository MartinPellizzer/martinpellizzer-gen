    "intro": "Spergularia insularis, commonly known as the island sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a small, herbaceous annual plant characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Native to coastal and sandy habitats, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. The plant is adapted to salty air and wind exposure, making it a typical component of dune ecosystems. Its presence is an indicator of stable, sandy coastal environments with minimal vegetation cover."
