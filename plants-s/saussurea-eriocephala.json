    "intro": "Saussurea eriocephala, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically in clusters at the top of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional medicine practices in the region."
