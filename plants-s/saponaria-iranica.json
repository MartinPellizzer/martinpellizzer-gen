It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features upright stems covered with soft, hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Saponaria iranica is known for its mild soap-like properties in its roots, which have been used traditionally in herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
