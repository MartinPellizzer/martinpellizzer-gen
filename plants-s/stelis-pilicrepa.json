    "intro": "Stelis pilicrepa, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive lip that is often hairy or fringed. Stelis pilicrepa is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
