    "intro": "Scleria cyathophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Its flowering stems bear small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Scleria cyathophora is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
