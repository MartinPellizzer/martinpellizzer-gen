    "intro": "Salix lanata richardsonii, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The bark is often smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that can be easily peeled."
