    "intro": "Stellaria borealis lusus dahurica, commonly known as the Arctic starflower, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, white or pale purple star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a cushion-like growth habit, with numerous small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
