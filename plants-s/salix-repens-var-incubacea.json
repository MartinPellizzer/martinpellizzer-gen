    "intro": "Salix repens var. incubacea, commonly known as the creeping willow or sand willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. This plant is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or desert environments."
