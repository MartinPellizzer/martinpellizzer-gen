    "intro": "Seriphidium vallesiacum, commonly known as the Vallesian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, spiny leaves that are adapted to arid and cold environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a composite head typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with well-drained soil."
