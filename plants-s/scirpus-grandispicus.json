    "intro": "Scirpus grandispicus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its stiff, triangular stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Scirpus grandispicus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
