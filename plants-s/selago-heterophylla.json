    "intro": "Selago heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf selago, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, often variable leaf shapes, which can range from linear to ovate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
