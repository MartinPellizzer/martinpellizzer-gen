    "intro": "Sium ventricosum, commonly known as bladder nut or water bladder, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its swollen, seed-containing pods that resemble bladders. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
