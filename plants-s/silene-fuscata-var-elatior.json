    "intro": "Silene fuscata var. elatior, commonly known as the tall sandstem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. The plant features slender, branching stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy flowers and succulent-like leaves."
