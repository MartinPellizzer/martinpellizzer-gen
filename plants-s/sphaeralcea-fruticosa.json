    "intro": "Sphaeralcea fruticosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, shrub-like plant with woody stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. Sphaeralcea fruticosa is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
