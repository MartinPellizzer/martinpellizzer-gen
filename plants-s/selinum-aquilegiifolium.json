    "intro": "Selinum aquilegiifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf evening-primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Selinum aquilegiifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
