    "intro": "Suregada multiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
