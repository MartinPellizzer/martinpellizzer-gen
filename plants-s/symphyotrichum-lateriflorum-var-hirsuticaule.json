    "intro": "Symphyotrichum lateriflorum var. hirsuticaule, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed New England aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue to purple composite flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens. The hairy-stemmed New England aster is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators late into the growing season."
