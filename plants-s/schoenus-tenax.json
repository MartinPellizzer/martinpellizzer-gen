    "intro": "Schoenus tenax, commonly known as the swamp grass or rigid swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Schoenus tenax thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of wildlife."
