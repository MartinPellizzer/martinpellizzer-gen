    "intro": "Solanum bukasovii f. multidissectum, commonly known as the highly dissected morning glory, is a variant of the Solanum bukasovii species, characterized by its deeply lobed and often fern-like foliage. This cultivar exhibits a unique morphology with leaves that are extensively divided into narrow segments, giving it an intricate, lace-like appearance. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with partial to full sun exposure. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. Due to its distinctive appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for its edible properties."
