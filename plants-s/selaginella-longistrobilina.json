    "intro": "Selaginella longistrobilina, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its compact, branching structure and tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain both microspores and megaspores, facilitating its reproductive cycle. Selaginella longistrobilina is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation and fire, due to its unique physiological adaptations."
