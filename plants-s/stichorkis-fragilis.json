    "intro": "Stichorkis fragilis, commonly known as the brittle stichorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a soft, velvety texture, while its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its fragility and limited distribution, Stichorkis fragilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
