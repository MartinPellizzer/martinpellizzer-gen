    "intro": "Silene pumila, commonly known as the dwarf catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. Its flowering stems are usually less than 10 centimeters tall, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Silene pumila is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems."
