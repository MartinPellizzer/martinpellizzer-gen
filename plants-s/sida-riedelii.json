    "intro": "Sida riedelii, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender stems and opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue to violet in color, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. Its fruits are small capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sida riedelii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal."
