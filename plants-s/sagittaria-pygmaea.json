    "intro": "Sagittaria pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in shallow water and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the sediment, allowing it to colonize new areas. Sagittaria pygmaea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates."
