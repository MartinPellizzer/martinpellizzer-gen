    "intro": "Solidago sera, commonly known as silverleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Solidago sera is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
