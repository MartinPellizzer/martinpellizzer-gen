    "intro": "Stellaria scapigera, commonly known as the scapose starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that rise from a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its flowers have five petals that are often notched or lobed, giving them a star-like appearance. Stellaria scapigera is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
