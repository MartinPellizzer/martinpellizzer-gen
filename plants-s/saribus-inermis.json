    "intro": "Saribus inermis, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender tree native to the tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. It has a single, unbranched stem that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of over 5 meters. The plant produces a distinctive fruit, the coconut, which contains both water and a white, fleshy interior called the endosperm. Saribus inermis is well-adapted to coastal environments, with a robust root system that helps prevent erosion. Its economic importance lies in the versatile use of its fruit, leaves, and trunk for food, construction, and fiber."
