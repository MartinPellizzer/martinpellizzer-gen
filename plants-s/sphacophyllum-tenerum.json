    "intro": "Sphacophyllum tenerum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Sphacophyllum tenerum is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings."
