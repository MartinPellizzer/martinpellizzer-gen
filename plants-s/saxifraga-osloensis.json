    "intro": "Saxifraga osloensis, commonly known as the Oslo saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold climates of Scandinavia and northern Europe. It typically thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine and subarctic regions. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early summer, producing a delicate, clustered inflorescence. Saxifraga osloensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, cold environments."
