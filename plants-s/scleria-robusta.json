    "intro": "Scleria robusta, commonly known as the broadleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features upright, grass-like stems with broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowering spikes are typically green or reddish, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Scleria robusta is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
