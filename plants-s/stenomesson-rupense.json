    "intro": "Stenomesson rupense, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stenomesson rupense thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal environments."
