It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It produces pink to red flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
