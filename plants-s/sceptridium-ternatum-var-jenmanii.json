    "intro": "Sceptridium ternatum var. jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, produce spores and are an essential feature of its life cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
