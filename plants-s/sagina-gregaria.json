    "intro": "Sagina gregaria, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in coastal areas, dunes, and disturbed sites due to its tolerance for harsh environmental conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces numerous small, capsule-like fruits. Sagina gregaria plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
