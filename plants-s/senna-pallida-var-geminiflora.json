    "intro": "Senna pallida var. geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered senna, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
