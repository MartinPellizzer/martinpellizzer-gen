It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Its leaves are small, ovate, and often covered in a fine pubescence, while its flowers range in color from white to pink.
