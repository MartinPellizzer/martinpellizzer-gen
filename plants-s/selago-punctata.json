    "intro": "Selago punctata, commonly known as the spotted grass. It is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Selago punctata is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas."
