    "intro": "Sida acuminata, commonly known as thornapple or sandmat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Sida acuminata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
