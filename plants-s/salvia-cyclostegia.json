    "intro": "Salvia cyclostegia, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
