    "intro": "Sedum minus, commonly known as little sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. Sedum minus is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it an excellent addition to xeriscaped landscapes."
