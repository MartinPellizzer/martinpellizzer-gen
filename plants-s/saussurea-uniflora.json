    "intro": "Saussurea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and a single, showy flower at the top of each stem. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic compound known as saussurea, which has been used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to cream in color, and the plant is adapted to cold, arid environments. Saussurea uniflora is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
