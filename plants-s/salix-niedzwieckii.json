    "intro": "Salix niedzwieckii, commonly known as the Niedzwieckii willow, is a species native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in mountainous areas. The plant has slender, flexible branches and produces catkins, which are its main reproductive structures. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they are usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. Salix niedzwieckii is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid environments."
