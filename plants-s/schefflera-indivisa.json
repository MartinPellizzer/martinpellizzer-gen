It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of large, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes."
