It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its clustered, fleshy fruits that resemble small, round gelatinous balls, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture with a distinctive aroma. Syncarpia glomulifera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
