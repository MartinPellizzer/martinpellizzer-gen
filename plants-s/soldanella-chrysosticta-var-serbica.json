    "intro": "Soldanella chrysosticta var. serbica, commonly known as the Serbian golden star, is a flowering plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is native to the Balkan Peninsula and is often found in mountain meadows and forest edges."
