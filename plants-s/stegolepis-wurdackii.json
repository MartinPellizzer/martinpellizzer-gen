    "intro": "Stegolepis wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's starfish flower, is a unique and rare plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that resemble the arms of a starfish, hence its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
