    "intro": "Stapelia ango, commonly known as the Angola carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, odorless flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a trait evolved to attract pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually small and reduced, while its stems are ribbed and can grow up to several feet in length. Stapelia ango is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions."
