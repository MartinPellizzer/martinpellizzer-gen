    "intro": "Sphincterostigma, commonly known as the \"spoonleaf\" or \"sphincterostigma,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with showy, five-lobed petals that attract pollinators. The plant produces capsules as fruits, containing numerous small seeds. Sphincterostigma is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
