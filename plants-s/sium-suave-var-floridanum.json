    "intro": "Sium suave var. floridanum, commonly known as Florida water parsley, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands, preferring partial to full shade. Its small white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
