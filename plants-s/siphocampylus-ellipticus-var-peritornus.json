    "intro": "Siphocampylus ellipticus var. peritornus, commonly known as the Peritornus siphocampylus, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white to pale yellow petals, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
