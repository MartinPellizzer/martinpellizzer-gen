    "intro": "Salsola cyclophylla, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant has small, green to bluish-gray leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Salsola cyclophylla is often found in sandy soils and can be an indicator of disturbed or degraded habitats."
