    "intro": "Scleria ciliata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-fruited sedges, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, clustered flower heads. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The smooth, hairless surface of its fruits distinguishes this variety from other forms of Scleria ciliata."
