    "intro": "Statice prolifera, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces spikes of small, vividly colored flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal and maritime environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. Statice prolifera is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
