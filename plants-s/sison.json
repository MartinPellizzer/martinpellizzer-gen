It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Sison thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
