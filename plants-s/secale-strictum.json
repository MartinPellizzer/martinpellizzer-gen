    "intro": "Secale strictum, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
