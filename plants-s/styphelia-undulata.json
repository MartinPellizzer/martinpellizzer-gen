    "intro": "Styphelia undulata, commonly known as the wavy stylewort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display. Styphelia undulata is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden coastal environments, making it a resilient species. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
