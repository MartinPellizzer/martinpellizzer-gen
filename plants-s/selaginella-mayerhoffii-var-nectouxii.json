    "intro": "Selaginella mayerhoffii var. nectouxii, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is noted for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to colonize difficult soils."
