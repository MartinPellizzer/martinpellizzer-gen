    "intro": "Syrenia pedunculata, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Florida and the Caribbean. It is a shrub that typically grows in swampy or marshy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Syrenia pedunculata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
