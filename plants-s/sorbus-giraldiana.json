    "intro": "Sorbus giraldiana, commonly known as the Italian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Its leaves are oval, serrated, and turn vibrant yellow or orange in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Sorbus giraldiana is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive form and seasonal interest."
