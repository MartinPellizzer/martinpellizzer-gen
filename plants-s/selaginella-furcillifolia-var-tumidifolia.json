    "intro": "Selaginella furcillifolia var. tumidifolia, commonly known as the inflated clubmoss, is a rare and delicate fern ally native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its unique, inflated spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant exhibits a distinct dichotomous branching pattern, with each stem splitting into two equal parts. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. This species is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
