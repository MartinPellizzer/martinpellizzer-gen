It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Strobilanthes ruficaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
