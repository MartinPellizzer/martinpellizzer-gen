It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga cespitosa. This plant typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, thriving in cold, rocky environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white, adapted to attract pollinators in harsh climates. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies of high-altitude flora."
