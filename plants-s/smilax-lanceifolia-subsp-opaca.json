    "intro": "Smilax lanceifolia subsp. opaca, commonly known as the opaca smilax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is a perennial vine characterized by its stout, thorned stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, wooded areas. The subspecies opaca is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and habitat preference compared to the typical form of Smilax lanceifolia."
