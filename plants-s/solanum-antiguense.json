    "intro": "Solanum antiguense, commonly known as the Antigua nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are yellow when ripe, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is usually avoided in agricultural settings."
