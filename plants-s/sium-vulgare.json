    "intro": "Sium vulgare, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to moist habitats in North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous and not particularly edible, though the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Sium vulgare plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
