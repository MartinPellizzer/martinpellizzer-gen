    "intro": "Selago dolosa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Selago dolosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
