    "intro": "Schubertia disticha var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with trailing stems that often hang down, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Schubertia disticha var. pendula is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
