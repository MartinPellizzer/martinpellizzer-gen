It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its distinctive zigzag growth pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating.
