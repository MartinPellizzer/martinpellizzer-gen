    "intro": "Solanum bullatum, commonly known as the bullate nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine, whitish pubescence. Solanum bullatum is part of the nightshade family and contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
