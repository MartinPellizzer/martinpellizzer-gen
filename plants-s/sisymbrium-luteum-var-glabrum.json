    "intro": "Sisymbrium luteum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth yellow mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, covered with small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dark brown to black in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, though the variety glabrum is notable for its smooth, hairless surface. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop."
