    "intro": "Serianthes sachetae, commonly known as the sacred tree of the Andaman Islands, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense, glossy green foliage. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and holds cultural significance for local communities."
