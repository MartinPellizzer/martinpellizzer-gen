    "intro": "Sida holtzei, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has deep root systems to access groundwater. Sida holtzei is often found in rocky soils and is used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance."
