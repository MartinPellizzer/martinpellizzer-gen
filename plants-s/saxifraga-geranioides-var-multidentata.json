    "intro": "Saxifraga geranioides var. multidentata, commonly known as the toothed saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
