    "intro": "Schizochilus rehmannii, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
