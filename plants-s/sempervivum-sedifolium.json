    "intro": "Sempervivum sedifolium, commonly known as the stonecrop or hen and chicks, is a succulent plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh climates, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
