It is a small, evergreen, creeping plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Selaginella hosei reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
