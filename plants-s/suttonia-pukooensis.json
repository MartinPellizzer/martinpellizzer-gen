It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its habitat, with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Suttonia pukooensis is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
