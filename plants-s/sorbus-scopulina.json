    "intro": "Sorbus scopulina, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a small shrub or tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. Sorbus scopulina is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
