It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Serratula sonchifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can become a weed."
