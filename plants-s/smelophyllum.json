    "intro": "Smelophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, translucent flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the branches of longleaf pine trees. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Smelophyllum is considered a vulnerable species."
