    "intro": "Stenotus pulvinatus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its stems are often swollen at the base, a feature that helps it store water. Stenotus pulvinatus is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
