    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. veronicifolia, commonly known as the stonecrop or veronicafolia saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features dense, compact foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Its hardy nature and ornamental value contribute to its appeal in both horticulture and ecological landscapes."
