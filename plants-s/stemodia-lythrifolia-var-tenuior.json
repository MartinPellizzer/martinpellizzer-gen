    "intro": "Stemodia lythrifolia var. tenuior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stemodia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, and the plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Stemodia lythrifolia."
