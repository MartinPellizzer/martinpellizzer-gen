    "intro": "Selaginella subtrisulcata, commonly known as the three-ribbed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged in three rows along the stem, giving it its characteristic appearance. It produces spores in structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella subtrisulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
