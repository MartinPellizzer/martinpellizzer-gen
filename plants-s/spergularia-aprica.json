    "intro": "Spergularia aprica, commonly known as spring sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and open habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Spergularia aprica is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal and sandy ecosystems."
