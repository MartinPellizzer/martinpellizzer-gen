    "intro": "Stegnogramma griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan starflower, is a small flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
