    "intro": "Stegolepis neblinensis, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, typical of its mountainous habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of the forest floor. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
