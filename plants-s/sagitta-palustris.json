    "intro": "Sagitta palustris, commonly known as the marsh arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Sagitta palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
