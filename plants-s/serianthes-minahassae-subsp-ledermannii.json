    "intro": "Serianthes minahassae subsp. ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, woody trunk, which can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in lowland and mountainous regions. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
