    "intro": "Stelis milagrensis, commonly known as the Milagros orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees or rocks without being parasitic. Stelis milagrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
