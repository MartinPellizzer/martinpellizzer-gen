    "intro": "Strychnos mocquerysi, commonly known as the Mexican poisonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which are found in its seeds and leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans, though it plays a role in local ecosystems."
