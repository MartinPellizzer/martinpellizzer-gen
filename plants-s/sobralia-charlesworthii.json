    "intro": "Sobralia charlesworthii, commonly known as the Charlesworth's sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant produces large, colorful bracts that are often mistaken for petals, while the actual flowers are small and clustered. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
