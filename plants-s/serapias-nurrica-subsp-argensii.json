    "intro": "Serapias nurrica subsp. argensii, commonly known as the Alaskan serapias, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
