    "intro": "Strychnos thyrsiflora, commonly known as the red spiderflower, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, bright red flowers that resemble spiders, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though some parts of the plant contain toxic compounds."
