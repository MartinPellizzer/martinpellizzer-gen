    "intro": "Salix leucophora, commonly known as the white-barked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, greenish female flowers that develop into samaras, or winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in alpine environments. Salix leucophora is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
