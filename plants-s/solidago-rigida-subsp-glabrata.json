    "intro": "Solidago rigida subsp. glabrata, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The subspecies glabrata differs from the typical S. rigida by having smoother, less hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
