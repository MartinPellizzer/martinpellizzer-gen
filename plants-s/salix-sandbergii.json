    "intro": "Salix sandbergii, commonly known as Sandberg's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion."
