    "intro": "Stapelia similis, commonly known as the false crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia similis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
