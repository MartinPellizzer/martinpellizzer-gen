    "intro": "Senecio daltonii, commonly known as Dalton's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
