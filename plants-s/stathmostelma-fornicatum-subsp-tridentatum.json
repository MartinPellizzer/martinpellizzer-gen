    "intro": "Stathmostelma fornicatum subsp. tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed stathmostelma, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, trifid (three-lobed) bracts, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, narrow leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
