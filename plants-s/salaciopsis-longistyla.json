It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces elongated, thread-like stamens that are distinctive features of its reproductive structure. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
