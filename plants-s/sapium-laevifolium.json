    "intro": "Sapium laevifolium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
