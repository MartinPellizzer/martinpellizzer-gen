    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. nana, commonly known as dwarf willow-leaf spiraea, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in garden landscapes for its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance."
