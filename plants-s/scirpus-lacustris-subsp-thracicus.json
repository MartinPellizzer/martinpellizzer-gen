    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris subsp. thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southeastern Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and lake margins. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. The species is adapted to aquatic conditions, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
