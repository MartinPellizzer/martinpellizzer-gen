    "intro": "Schellolepis arguta, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, greenish capsules that mature into bright orange-red berries. Schellolepis arguta is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Euphorbiaceae family."
