It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed edges, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
