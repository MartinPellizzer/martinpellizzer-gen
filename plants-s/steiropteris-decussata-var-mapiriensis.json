    "intro": "Steiropteris decussata var. mapiriensis, commonly known as the Mapiri fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of South America. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two rows of pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as montane forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
