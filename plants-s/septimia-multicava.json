    "intro": "Septimia multicava, commonly known as the hollow stem plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, hollow stems that are often segmented and ribbed. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Septimia multicava is notable for its ability to store water in its stem, making it resilient to periods of drought."
