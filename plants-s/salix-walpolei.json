    "intro": "Salix walpolei, commonly known as the Walpole willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. This shrub or small tree typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight in its alpine environment. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are pollinated by wind, a common trait among willow species."
