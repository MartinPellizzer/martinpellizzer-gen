    "intro": "Silene sendtneri subsp. sendtneri, commonly known as the Sendtner's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
