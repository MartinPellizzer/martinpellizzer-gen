    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 clarkei, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, often reddish leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
