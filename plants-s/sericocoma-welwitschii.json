    "intro": "Sericocoma welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Sericocoma welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
