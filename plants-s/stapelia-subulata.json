    "intro": "Stapelia subulata, commonly known as the needle-stem stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spiny, needle-like structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often described as resembling a corpse, a characteristic shared with other stapelia species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Stapelia subulata is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
