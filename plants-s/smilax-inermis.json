    "intro": "Smilax inermis, commonly known as the smooth smilax, is a vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and the absence of spines, which distinguishes it from other smilax species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its berries are dark red and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Smilax inermis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps."
