    "intro": "Stelis nivalis, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in cloud forests. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, and it has a short growth cycle adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Stelis nivalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses for its unique floral display."
