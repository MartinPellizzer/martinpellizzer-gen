    "intro": "Schedonorus madritensis var. ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with short, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild summers and cold winters. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
