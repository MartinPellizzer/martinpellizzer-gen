    "intro": "Sparganophorus verticillata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often along rocky soils or in disturbed areas. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
