    "intro": "Serjania incana f. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a flowering plant species native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
