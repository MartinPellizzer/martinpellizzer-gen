    "intro": "Struthiopteris niponica f. minima, commonly known as the Japanese clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the branches. This fern-like species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
