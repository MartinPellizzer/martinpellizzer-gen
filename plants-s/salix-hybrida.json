    "intro": "Salix hybrida, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and small, oval leaves with a finely toothed margin. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Salix hybrida is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
