    "intro": "Sagittaria calycina var. spongiosa, commonly known as the sponge arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a spongy texture that helps it float. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late summer. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, making it an effective plant for stabilizing aquatic sediments. Sagittaria calycina var. spongiosa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
