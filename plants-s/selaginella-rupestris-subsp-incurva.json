    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris subsp. incurva, commonly known as the curling spikemoss, is a rare and specialized vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive, curling foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
