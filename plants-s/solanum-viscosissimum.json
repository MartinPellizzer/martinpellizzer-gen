    "intro": "Solanum viscosissimum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by livestock and wildlife."
