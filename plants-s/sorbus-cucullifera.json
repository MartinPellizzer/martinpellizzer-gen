    "intro": "Sorbus cucullifera, commonly known as the hooded whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, hood-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
