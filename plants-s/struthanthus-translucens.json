It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique leaf structure allows it to conserve water efficiently, adapting to its harsh native habitat. The species is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a minor role in local biodiversity."
