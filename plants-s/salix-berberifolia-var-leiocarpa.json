    "intro": "Salix berberifolia var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in riparian areas. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in wet meadows."
