    "intro": "Sida integerrima, commonly known as the Mexican mallow or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in warm, moist environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Sida integerrima has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
