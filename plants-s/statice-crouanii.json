    "intro": "Statice crouanii, commonly known as the Crouan's sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid and salty conditions. Statice crouanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
