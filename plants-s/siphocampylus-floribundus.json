    "intro": "Siphocampylus floribundus, commonly known as the flowering siphocampylus, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
