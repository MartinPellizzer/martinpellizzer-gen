    "intro": "Sarcopteryx montana, commonly known as the mountain spleenwort, is a species of moss that belongs to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, dark green leaves that are often curved. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are usually short and robust, with a capsule that releases spores for dispersal. Sarcopteryx montana is adapted to high-altitude and cold climates, making it a characteristic species of mountainous regions."
