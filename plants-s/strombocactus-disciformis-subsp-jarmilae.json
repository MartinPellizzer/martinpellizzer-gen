    "intro": "Strombocactus disciformis subsp. jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae's disc-cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
