This herbaceous plant features a distinctive, spurred labellum that resembles a small sac, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is known for its ephemeral blooming period, which occurs during the warmer months."
