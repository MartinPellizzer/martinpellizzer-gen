    "intro": "Sigesbeckia orientalis f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved spurge, is a variant of the spurge plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, orange-colored seed capsules. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a distinctive waxy texture, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This subspecies is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along the edges of water bodies."
