    "intro": "Salix longifolia f. integerrima, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a variant of the longleaf willow characterized by its smooth, hairless bark and elongated, slender leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. The plant thrives in moist environments, often found near streams, rivers, or wetlands. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a pointed tip and a smooth margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and the plant is valued for its adaptability and aesthetic qualities in horticulture."
