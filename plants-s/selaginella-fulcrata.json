    "intro": "Selaginella fulcrata, commonly known as the stair-step moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its segmented, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella fulcrata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
