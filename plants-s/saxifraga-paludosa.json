    "intro": "Saxifraga paludosa, commonly known as the bog saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, which helps reduce water loss in its wet habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. Saxifraga paludosa plays an important role in stabilizing peat soils and supporting local biodiversity."
