It is characterized by its soft, glandular leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. It has a sprawling or shrub-like growth habit and produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
