It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features glandular hairs on its leaves, which give it a sticky texture and aid in water retention. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind."
