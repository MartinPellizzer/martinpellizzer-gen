    "intro": "Sclerolaena muricata var. muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf sclerolaena, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and oval, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland shrublands."
