    "intro": "Symphyotrichum \u00d7 gravesii, commonly known as the New England aster hybrid, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Symphyotrichum novae-angliae (New England aster) and Symphyotrichum laeve (smooth aster). The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade in moist, well-drained soils. Symphyotrichum \u00d7 gravesii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
