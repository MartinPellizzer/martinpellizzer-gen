    "intro": "Statice frederici, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its showy, spike-like flower heads that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands, which help it tolerate harsh maritime conditions. Statice frederici is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
