    "intro": "Spilanthes karvinskiana, commonly known as the toothache plant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, pungent odor, which is believed to be a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. Spilanthes karvinskiana has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, particularly for its ability to alleviate toothache pain."
