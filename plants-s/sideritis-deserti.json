    "intro": "Sideritis deserti, commonly known as the desert sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Sideritis deserti is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration."
