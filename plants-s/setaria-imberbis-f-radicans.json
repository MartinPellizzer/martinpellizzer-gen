    "intro": "Setaria imberbis f. radicans, commonly known as the creeping foxtail, is a grass species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the ground. It produces slender, bristly spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to various regions of the United States and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural and ornamental settings."
