    "intro": "Silvia navalium, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in tidal zones. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can grow up to several meters in height. Silvia navalium plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various coastal wildlife species."
