It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing numerous small, flat seeds. Senna acutisepala is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
