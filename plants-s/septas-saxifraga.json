    "intro": "Septas saxifraga, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white coating. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are arranged in a cluster at the top of the plant. Septas saxifraga is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
