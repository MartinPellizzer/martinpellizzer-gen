    "intro": "Sievekingia trollii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead relies on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small, pale green, and often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Sievekingia trollii is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
