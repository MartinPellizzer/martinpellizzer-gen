It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
