It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
