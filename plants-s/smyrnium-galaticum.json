    "intro": "Smyrnium galaticum, commonly known as the galactic smyrnium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens."
