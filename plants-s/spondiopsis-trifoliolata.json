    "intro": "Spondiopsis trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf spondias, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The tree thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to humid, warm climates."
