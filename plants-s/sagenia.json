    "intro": "Sagenia, commonly known as the \"devil's toenail,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Sagenia microphylla, which is native to southern Africa. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their smooth, often thorny bark and alternate, simple leaves. Sagenia species produce small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
