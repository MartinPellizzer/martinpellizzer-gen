It features dense, compact rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
