    "intro": "Stapelia grandidens, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, meaty-looking flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a feature evolved to attract pollinators like flies. These flowers are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. Stapelia grandidens is a popular houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
