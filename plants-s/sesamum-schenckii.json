    "intro": "Sesamum schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's sesame, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and linear leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain small, flat seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Sesamum genus."
