    "intro": "Sempervivum marmoreum var. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Alps. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a distinctive mottled appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
