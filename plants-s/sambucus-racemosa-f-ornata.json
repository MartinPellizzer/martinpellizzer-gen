It is characterized by its striking clusters of white to pale pink flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both beauty and ecological benefits."
