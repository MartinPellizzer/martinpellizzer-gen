It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Serraea arabica is also noted for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus."
