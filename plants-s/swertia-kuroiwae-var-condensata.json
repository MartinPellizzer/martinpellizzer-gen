It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in racemose inflorescences.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
