It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
