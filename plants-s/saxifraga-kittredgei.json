    "intro": "Saxifraga kittredgei, commonly known as Kittredge's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
