    "intro": "Sarcochilus brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with thick, fleshy roots adapted for storing water. The plant produces erect, hairy stems that bear a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive helmet-shaped labellum. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This species thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas."
