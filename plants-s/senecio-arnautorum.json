    "intro": "Senecio arnautorum, commonly known as the \"Snowy-haired Senecio,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
