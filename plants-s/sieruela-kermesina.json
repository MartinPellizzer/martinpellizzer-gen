    "intro": "Sieruela kermesina, commonly known as the Kermesina broom, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, coastal climates of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
