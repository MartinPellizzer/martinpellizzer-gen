    "intro": "Sclerobassia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bladderworts, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes many carnivorous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, erect stems and yellowish flowers, which bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it can tolerate salt spray and wind. Sclerobassia litoralis is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, often relying on insect prey for additional nutrients."
