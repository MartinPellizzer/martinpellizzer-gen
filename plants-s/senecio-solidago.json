    "intro": "Senecio solidago, commonly known as the yellow ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow buds that open into composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Senecio solidago is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
