It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and pale green to brown in color. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
