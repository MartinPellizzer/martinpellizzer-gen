It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other sorghum varieties. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. This subspecies is often used in ornamental horticulture and as a forage crop in certain regions."
