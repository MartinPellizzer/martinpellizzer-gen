    "intro": "Soroseris depressa, commonly known as the creeping sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Soroseris depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
