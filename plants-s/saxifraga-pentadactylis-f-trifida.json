    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis f. trifida, commonly known as the three-fingered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically divided into three lobes, giving it the common name \"three-fingered.\" This variant is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
