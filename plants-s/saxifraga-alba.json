    "intro": "Saxifraga alba, commonly known as white saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga alba is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance."
