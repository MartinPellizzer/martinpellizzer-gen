    "intro": "Sericostoma persicum, commonly known as the Persian sericostoma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat."
