    "intro": "Saxifraga serra, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh. The plant features basal leaves that are elongated and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters. Saxifraga serra is known for its ability to thrive in cold climates and is often found in mountainous terrain. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its adaptability."
