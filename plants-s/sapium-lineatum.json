    "intro": "Sapium lineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese lantern, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery, orange-red seed pods that resemble small lanterns, which split open when mature to release its seeds. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is typically grown as an annual or biennial. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
