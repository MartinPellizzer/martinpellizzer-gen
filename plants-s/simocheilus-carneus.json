    "intro": "Simocheilus carneus, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often reddish in color, especially at the base, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in dense clusters and bloom in the early spring. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
