    "intro": "Stylochaeton heterophyllum f. subcordatum, commonly known as the subcordate form of the genus Stylochaeton, is a variant of a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive subcordate leaf shape, which tapers gradually toward the base, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a structure typical of the Malvaceae family. This form is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and potential ecological significance."
