    "intro": "Stachytarpheta caatingensis, commonly known as the caatinga bluetongue, is a shrub native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue-violet flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Stachytarpheta caatingensis is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
