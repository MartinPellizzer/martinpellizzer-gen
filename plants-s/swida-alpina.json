    "intro": "Swida alpina, commonly known as the alpine swida, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool temperatures. Swida alpina has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
