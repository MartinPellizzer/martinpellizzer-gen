    "intro": "Stipa chrysophylla var. crispula, commonly known as the golden feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often exhibit a striking golden hue. The inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, bristly flowers, which are typically pale green to yellowish in color. This variety is noted for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and landscapes where its delicate appearance and seasonal color changes are appreciated. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
