    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon bogotense f. renifolium, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 stigmaphyllon, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes of Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive reniform (kidney-shaped) leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale pink to white coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
