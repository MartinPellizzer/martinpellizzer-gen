    "intro": "Staurogyne petelotii, commonly known as the Brazilian waterwheel plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is adapted to slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic life. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful pond plant and a potential invasive species in non-native waters."
