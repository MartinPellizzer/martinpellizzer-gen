    "intro": "Selaginella caesia var. violacea, commonly known as the violet spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rosette-like structure with closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with a violet hue. Its sporophyte produces spores on specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
