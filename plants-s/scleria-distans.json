    "intro": "Scleria distans, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typical of the sedge family. Scleria distans is often found in wet or marshy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
