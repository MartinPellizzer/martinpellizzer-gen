    "intro": "Saussurea alpina subsp. depressa, commonly known as the Alpine safflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh mountain climates. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters."
