    "intro": "Stapeliopsis cooperi, commonly known as the ghost flower or ghost plant, is a succulent belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like structures that resemble the limbs of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, often in a clustered arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
