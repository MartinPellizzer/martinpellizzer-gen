    "intro": "Stuckenia marina, commonly known as sea club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, such as estuaries and tidal marshes, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. Stuckenia marina plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
