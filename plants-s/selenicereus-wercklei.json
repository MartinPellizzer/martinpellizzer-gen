    "intro": "Selenicereus wercklei, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces a fragrant bloom that typically lasts only one night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Selenicereus wercklei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
