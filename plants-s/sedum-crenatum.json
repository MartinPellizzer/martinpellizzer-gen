    "intro": "Sedum crenatum, commonly known as the scalycup sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, rounded leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Sedum crenatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
