    "intro": "Sempervivum smithii, commonly known as the Smith's houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the Alps. It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall flowering stalks with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Sempervivum smithii is known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions."
