    "intro": "Sporobolus littoralis var. elongatus, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and tidal zones. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and withstand harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation. The variety elongatus is distinguished by its longer, more slender leaves compared to other varieties of Sporobolus littoralis."
