    "intro": "Schoenus xyridioides, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense tussocks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
