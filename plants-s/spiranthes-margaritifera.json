    "intro": "Spiranthes margaritifera, commonly known as the bead lily, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral arrangement of white flowers that resemble tiny beads, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown seed pods after flowering. Spiranthes margaritifera is an ephemeral plant, often blooming briefly in late spring or early summer."
