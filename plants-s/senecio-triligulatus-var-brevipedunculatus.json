    "intro": "Senecio triligulatus var. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the short-stalked groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like inflorescence with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has linear, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are short and often branched. This variety is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form of Senecio triligulatus."
