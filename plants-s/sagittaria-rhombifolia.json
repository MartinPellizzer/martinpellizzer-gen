    "intro": "Sagittaria rhombifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It has distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a narrow, pointed tip. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Sagittaria rhombifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and ponds."
