    "intro": "Sparganium polyedrum, commonly known as the spiked bur reed, is a perennial wetland plant belonging to the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of spiky, yellowish flowers, which are typically visible in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to habitat structure for aquatic life. The showy, spiky inflorescences also make it a notable species for wetland restoration and ecological studies."
