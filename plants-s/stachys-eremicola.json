    "intro": "Stachys eremicola, commonly known as the desert betony, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, drought-prone conditions. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of violet or purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Stachys eremicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
