    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei f. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf saxifrage, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems with broad, ovate leaves that are typically green with a distinctive red or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
