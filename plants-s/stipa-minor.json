    "intro": "Stipa minor, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Stipa minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
