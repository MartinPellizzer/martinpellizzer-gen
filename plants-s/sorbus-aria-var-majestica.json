    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. majestica, commonly known as the white-rayed rowan, is a variant of the rowan tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking white bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves, giving it a striking floral appearance. The tree produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks."
