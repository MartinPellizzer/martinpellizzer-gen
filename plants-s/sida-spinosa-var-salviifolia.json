    "intro": "Sida spinosa var. salviifolia, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with a heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance contribute to its ecological resilience in semi-desert regions."
