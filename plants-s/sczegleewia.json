    "intro": "Sczegleewia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, Sczegleewia is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
