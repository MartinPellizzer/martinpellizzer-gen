    "intro": "Sesleria varia f. scabridula, commonly known as the scabrous sesleria, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically grayish-green and covered in fine, scaly textures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
