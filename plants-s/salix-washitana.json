    "intro": "Salix washitana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Salix washitana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
