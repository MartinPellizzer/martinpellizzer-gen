    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. cryptostylum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a botanical variant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, egg-shaped berries that are usually green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
