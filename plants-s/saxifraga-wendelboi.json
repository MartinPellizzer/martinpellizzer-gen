    "intro": "Saxifraga wendelboi, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense cushions of foliage. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga wendelboi is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
