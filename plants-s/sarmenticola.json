    "intro": "Sarmenticola, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with aerial roots that allow it to ascend tree trunks and other structures. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and often have a glossy surface. Sarmenticola species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. They play an important ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of their native environments."
