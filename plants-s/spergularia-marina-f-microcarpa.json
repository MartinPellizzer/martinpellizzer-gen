    "intro": "Spergularia marina f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sea sandwort, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in tidal zones and salt marshes. Its compact growth form and salt tolerance make it an important component of coastal vegetation."
