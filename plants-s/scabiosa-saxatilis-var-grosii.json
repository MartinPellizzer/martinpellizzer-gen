    "intro": "Scabiosa saxatilis var. grosii, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
