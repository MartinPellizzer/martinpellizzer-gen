It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are the male flowers, and small, greenish female flowers. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration."
