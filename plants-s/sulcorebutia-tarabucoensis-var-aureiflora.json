    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tarabucoensis var. aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered sun rose, is a succulent native to the Andes of Peru. It features compact, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to pale green woolly hair. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on racemes at the stem tips. Its leaves are usually fleshy and cylindrical, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
