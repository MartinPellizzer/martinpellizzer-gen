    "intro": "Salix nigra var. altissima, commonly known as the tall black willow, is a variant of the black willow native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows along stream banks and moist soils. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, fuzzy texture on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
