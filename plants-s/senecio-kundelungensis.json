    "intro": "Senecio kundelungensis, commonly known as the Kundelungue groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like blooms. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
