    "intro": "Sorindeia collina, commonly known as the mountain sorindeia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months of the year. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand the harsh mountain climate. Sorindeia collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
