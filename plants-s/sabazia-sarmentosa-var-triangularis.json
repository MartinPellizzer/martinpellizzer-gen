    "intro": "Sabazia sarmentosa var. triangularis, commonly known as the three-angled sabazia, is a climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular stems, which are a key botanical feature. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds upon maturity. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments within the undergrowth of tropical forests."
