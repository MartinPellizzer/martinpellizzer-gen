    "intro": "Schiedea kaalae, commonly known as the Kalaee or the Haleakala silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-blue, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces a single, tall stem with showy yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Schiedea kaalae is critically endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
