It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has hollow, segmented stems with a smooth, greenish-brown surface. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This bamboo is valued not only for its timber but also for its edible shoots, which are commonly consumed in traditional Chinese cuisine."
