    "intro": "Solanum celsum, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
