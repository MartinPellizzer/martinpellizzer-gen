    "intro": "Smilax siphilitica var. aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian smilax, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features a robust, woody stem with thorn-covered stems and leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its berries are dark red to black when mature and are an important food source for various birds and mammals. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of S. siphilitica."
