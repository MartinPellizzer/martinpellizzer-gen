    "intro": "Schismus patens, commonly known as the desert carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Schismus patens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems."
