    "intro": "Senecio humphreysii, commonly known as Humphreys' groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. It is often found in habitats such as crevices and open slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
