It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its flowering period occurs later in the growing season, hence the species name \"tardivum,\" meaning \"late.\" The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
