    "intro": "Steiractinia mollis, commonly known as the slender coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are often covered in a dense, coral-like structure, which gives it its common name. Steiractinia mollis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in tropical forests."
