    "intro": "Sageretia horridissima, commonly known as the rough sageretia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Sageretia horridissima is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
