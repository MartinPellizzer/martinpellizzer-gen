    "intro": "Streblus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable-leaf sycoglossum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be simple or compound depending on the environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
