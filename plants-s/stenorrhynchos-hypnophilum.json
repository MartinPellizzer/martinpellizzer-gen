    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos hypnophilum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the forest floor. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
