    "intro": "Senecio lessingii, commonly known as the Lessing's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio lessingii is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
