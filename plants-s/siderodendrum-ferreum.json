    "intro": "Siderodendrum ferreum, commonly known as the Ironwood Tree, is a species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, iron-like bark, which gives it its common name and provides resistance to pests and diseases. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its leaves are typically small and leathery, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds. Siderodendrum ferreum is valued for its hard wood and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
