    "intro": "Sempervivum herfriedianum, commonly known as the Herfriedian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its common name reflects its historical use as a symbol of good luck and its association with domestic spaces."
