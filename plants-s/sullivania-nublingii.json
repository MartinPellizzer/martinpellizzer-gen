    "intro": "Sullivania nublingii, commonly known as the Nubling's sullivania, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
