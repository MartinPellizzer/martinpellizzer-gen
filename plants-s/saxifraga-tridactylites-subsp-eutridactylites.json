    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites subsp. eutridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This subspecies is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with three distinct lobes giving it its common name."
