    "intro": "Silene glutinosa, commonly known as sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a sticky texture, which helps in retaining moisture. Silene glutinosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including meadows and roadsides."
