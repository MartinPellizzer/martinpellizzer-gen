    "intro": "Senegalia senegal, commonly known as the Acacia senegal or gum arabic tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. It produces a valuable gum, known as gum arabic, which is harvested from its bark. This species plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife."
