    "intro": "Spiraea oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, oblong leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and early blooming habit make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
