    "intro": "Spiesia leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Spiesia leptophylla is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for efficient water absorption."
