    "intro": "Stachys pumila, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears, hence its common name, and produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Stachys pumila is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
