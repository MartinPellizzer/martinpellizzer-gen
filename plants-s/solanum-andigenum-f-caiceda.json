    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. caiceda, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
