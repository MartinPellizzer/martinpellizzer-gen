    "intro": "Sida martiana, commonly known as the seaside cotton or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sida martiana plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
