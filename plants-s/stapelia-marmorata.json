    "intro": "Stapelia marmorata, commonly known as the Marble Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, waxy texture. Its leaves are usually small and rounded, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia marmorata is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
