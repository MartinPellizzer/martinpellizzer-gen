    "intro": "Spergularia rubra var. atheniensis, commonly known as the Athens sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, pink to red flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
