It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as mountain forests and stream banks. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin. Salix bhutanensis is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
