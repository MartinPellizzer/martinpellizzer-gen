It belongs to the Styracaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Styrax obassia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
