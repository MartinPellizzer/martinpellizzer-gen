    "intro": "Salix longifolia var. exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat in its native range."
