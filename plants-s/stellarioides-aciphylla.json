    "intro": "Stellarioides aciphylla, commonly known as the leafless starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems and bracts. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Stellarioides aciphylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
