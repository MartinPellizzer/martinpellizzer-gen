    "intro": "Salix oblongella, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats or forest edges. Salix oblongella plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
