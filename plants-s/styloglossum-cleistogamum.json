It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is native to certain regions of Europe. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that remain closed during bloom, facilitating self-fertilization. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem. Styloglossum cleistogamum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
