    "intro": "Saxifraga peplidifolia var. foliata, commonly known as the leafy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
