    "intro": "Salix farriae var. walpolei, commonly known as the Walpole willow, is a rare and unique variant of the farriae willow species. It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, specifically in the Yunnan province. This plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
