    "intro": "Stachys glandulifera, commonly known as sticky betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of blue to purple. The plant is notable for its glandular hairs, which give it a sticky texture and contribute to its common name. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Stachys glandulifera is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
