    "intro": "Salvia rufula subsp. rufula, commonly known as the rough sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age, and its leaves are oppositely arranged. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
