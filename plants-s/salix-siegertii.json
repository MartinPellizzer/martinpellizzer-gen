    "intro": "Salix siegertii, commonly known as Siegert's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
