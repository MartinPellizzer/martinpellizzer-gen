    "intro": "Salvinia nigropunctata, commonly known as the black-spotted water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are covered with small, dark spots, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant reproduces through the production of spores rather than seeds, a characteristic typical of ferns. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
