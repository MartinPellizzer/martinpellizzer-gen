    "intro": "Solanum formonense, commonly known as the Formosa nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
