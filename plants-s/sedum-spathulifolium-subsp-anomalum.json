    "intro": "Sedum spathulifolium subsp. anomalum, commonly known as the broad-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
