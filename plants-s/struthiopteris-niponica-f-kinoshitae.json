It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variant is distinguished by its specific morphological traits and geographic distribution."
