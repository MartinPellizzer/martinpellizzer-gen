    "intro": "Salvia blepharophylla, commonly known as the Sierra foothill sage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in woodland and chaparral habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia blepharophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
