    "intro": "Stratiotes quinquealatus, commonly known as the water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's edge. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Stratiotes quinquealatus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
