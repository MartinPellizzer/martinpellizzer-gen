    "intro": "Sida acerifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf sida, is a shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sida acerifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
