It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn a striking yellow or orange in the autumn. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its attractive bark and seasonal foliage. It is relatively hardy and suitable for a variety of garden conditions."
