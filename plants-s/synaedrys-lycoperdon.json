    "intro": "Synaedrys lycoperdon, commonly known as the common puffball, is a member of the Agaricaceae family and is characterized by its large, round, white to yellowish fruiting bodies. It typically grows in grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields. The fruiting body is composed of a single, dense mass of spore-bearing cells, which turns into a powdery spore mass when mature. It lacks a distinct stem and has a smooth, firm surface that becomes porous as it ages. This mushroom is edible when young but becomes inedible and toxic as it matures."
