    "intro": "Saussurea duiensis, commonly known as the Tibetan yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the cold and harsh conditions of its habitat. Its yellowish flower heads are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
