    "intro": "Stachys biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, hairy stems that are often branching. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Stachys biflora is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
