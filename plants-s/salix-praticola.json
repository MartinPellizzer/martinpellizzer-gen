    "intro": "Salix praticola, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in wetlands. Salix praticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
