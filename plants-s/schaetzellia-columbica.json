    "intro": "Schaetzellia columbica, commonly known as the Columbia sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
