It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It has a low-growing habit with rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
