    "intro": "Solanum orgadophilum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds. Solanum orgadophilum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
