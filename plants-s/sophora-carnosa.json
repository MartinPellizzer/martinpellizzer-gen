    "intro": "Sophora carnosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarack, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flat, leathery seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Sophora carnosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
