It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spikes of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
