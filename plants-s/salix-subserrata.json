    "intro": "Salix subserrata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with some variation depending on the age of the plant. Salix subserrata is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
