    "intro": "Stipa scribneri, commonly known as Scribner's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa scribneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
