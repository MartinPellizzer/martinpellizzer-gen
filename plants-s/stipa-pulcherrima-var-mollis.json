It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a soft, silky appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more silvery as the plant matures. This ornamental grass is often cultivated for its unique texture and visual appeal in gardens and landscapes."
