    "intro": "Secamone maritima, commonly known as sea secamone, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Secamone maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
