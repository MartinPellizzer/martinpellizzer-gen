    "intro": "Sarcoglottis stergiosii, commonly known as the Greek slipper orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a specialized structure used to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in well-drained soil and partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcoglottis stergiosii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
