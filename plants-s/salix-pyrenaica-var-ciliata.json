    "intro": "Salix pyrenaica var. ciliata, commonly known as the Pyrenean willow with ciliate margins, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely hairy margins. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
