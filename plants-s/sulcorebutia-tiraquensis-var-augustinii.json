    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis var. augustinii, commonly known as the Tiraqu\u00e9n Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Andes of Peru. It features a short, thick stem covered in dense, woolly white spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
