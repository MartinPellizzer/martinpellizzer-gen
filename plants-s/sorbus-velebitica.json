It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by small, red-orange berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
