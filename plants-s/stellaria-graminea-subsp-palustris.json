    "intro": "Stellaria graminea subsp. palustris, commonly known as marsh starwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, upright stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along stream banks. This subspecies is characterized by its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
