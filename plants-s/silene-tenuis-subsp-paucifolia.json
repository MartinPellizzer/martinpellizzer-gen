    "intro": "Silene tenuis subsp. paucifolia, commonly known as the slender catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Silene tenuis subsp. paucifolia is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
