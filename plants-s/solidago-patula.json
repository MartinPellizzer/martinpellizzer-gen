    "intro": "Solidago patula, commonly known as the swamp goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Solidago patula plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
