    "intro": "Salix brachystachys var. tenuijulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
