    "intro": "Selliguea veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a thallus that is usually lobed and can form dense mats on soil or rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for propagation. Selliguea veitchii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
