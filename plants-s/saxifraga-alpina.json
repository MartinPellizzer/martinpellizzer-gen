    "intro": "Saxifraga alpina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often on slopes or in crevices where it can anchor itself securely. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga alpina is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
