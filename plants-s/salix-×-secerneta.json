    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salix \u00d7 secernera, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving it a graceful and ornamental look. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and along waterways."
