    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved spiraea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features dense, upright growth with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and seasonal flowering, making it a popular choice in horticulture."
