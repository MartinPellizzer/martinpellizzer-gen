    "intro": "Sphenostigma longispathum var. filiforme, commonly known as the thread-leaved sphenostigma, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, thread-like fronds. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in tropical rainforests. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the spores necessary for its propagation. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
