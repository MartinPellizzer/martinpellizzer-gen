    "intro": "Selaginella wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has whorled leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curved, and it produces strobila (cone-like structures) that contain spores. It is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. Selaginella wettsteinii is also notable for its morphological adaptations that allow it to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
