    "intro": "Steptorhamphus, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often bright yellow or golden in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Steptorhamphus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
