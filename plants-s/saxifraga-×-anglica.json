    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 anglica, commonly known as the English saxifrage, is a hybrid plant that originates from the cross between Saxifraga umbrosa and Saxifraga oppositifolia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with rosettes of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Saxifraga \u00d7 anglica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and early bloom."
