    "intro": "Scleria tryonii, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Scleria tryonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
