    "intro": "Selliguea himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid body with a distinct dorsal and ventral surface, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Selliguea himalayensis is often found in mountainous regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich habitats."
