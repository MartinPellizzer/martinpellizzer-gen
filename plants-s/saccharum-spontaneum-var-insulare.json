It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and coarse, serrated leaves. This plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils, showcasing its adaptability to diverse environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands. The plant is closely related to sugarcane and has been studied for its potential in biofuel production and ecological restoration."
