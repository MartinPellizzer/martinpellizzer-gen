    "intro": "Silvinula humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features a compact rosette of fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish powder. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Silvinula humifusa thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
