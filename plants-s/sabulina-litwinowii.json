    "intro": "Sabulina litwinowii, commonly known as the sand bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Sabulina litwinowii is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
