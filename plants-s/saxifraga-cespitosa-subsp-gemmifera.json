    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. gemmifera, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with ovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its growth habit and ability to form extensive colonies make it an important component of mountainous and tundra ecosystems."
