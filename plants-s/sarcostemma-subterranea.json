    "intro": "Sarcostemma subterranea, commonly known as the underground milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the Apocynaceae family. Sarcostemma subterranea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in disturbed soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought."
