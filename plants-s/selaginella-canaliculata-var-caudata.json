It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
