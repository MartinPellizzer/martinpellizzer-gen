    "intro": "Sisymbrium austriacum proles tilieri, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and elongated, branched stems. The plant typically attaches itself to the roots of host plants such as grasses and legumes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
