    "intro": "Senecio sulcatus, commonly known as the African carpetweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that features small, narrow leaves with a distinctive wavy or serrated edge. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is often considered a weed in cultivated landscapes."
