    "intro": "Stapelia unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, waxy flowers that resemble a horn, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, star-shaped blooms in shades of yellow to orange, often with a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Stapelia unicornis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
