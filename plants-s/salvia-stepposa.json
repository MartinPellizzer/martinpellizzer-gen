    "intro": "Salvia stepposa, commonly known as steppe sage, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
