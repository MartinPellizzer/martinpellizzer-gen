    "intro": "Symphyotrichum spathulatum var. yosemitanum, commonly known as the Yosemitan New York ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Sierra Nevada foothills of California. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with rough, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This variant is notable for its distinctive floral structure and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
