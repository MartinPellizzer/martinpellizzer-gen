It is a perennial herb with a short, branched stem and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Stigmaphyllon herbaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
