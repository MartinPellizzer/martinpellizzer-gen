    "intro": "Strophacanthus membranifolius var. tenellus, commonly known as the slender leafed strophacanthus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, membranous leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, oval-shaped capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
