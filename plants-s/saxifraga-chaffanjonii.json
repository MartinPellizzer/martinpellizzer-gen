    "intro": "Saxifraga chaffanjonii, commonly known as the Chaffanjon's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
