    "intro": "Saxifraga androsacea f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant against extreme cold. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower with five petals, typically emerging from the center of the rosette in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
