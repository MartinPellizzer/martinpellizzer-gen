    "intro": "Salix arguta var. pallescens, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically white-tinged on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
