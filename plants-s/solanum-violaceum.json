    "intro": "Solanum violaceum, commonly known as the violetleaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its violet-colored leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic compounds similar to other members of the Solanum genus. Solanum violaceum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along streambanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
