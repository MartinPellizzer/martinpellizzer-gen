    "intro": "Sarmienta repens, commonly known as creeping sarmienta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its prostrate stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Sarmienta repens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
