    "intro": "Salix nivea var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrowly elliptic, with a soft, velvety texture on both sides, contributing to its common name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
