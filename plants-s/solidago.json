    "intro": "Solidago, commonly known as goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the northern hemisphere and are characterized by their bright yellow inflorescences. They typically grow in moist soils and are often found in meadows, prairies, and along roadsides. Solidago species are perennial herbs with alternate, lance-shaped leaves and showy composite flowers. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
