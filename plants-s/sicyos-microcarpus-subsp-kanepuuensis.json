    "intro": "Sicyos microcarpus subsp. kanepuuensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sicyos, is a climbing vine native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
