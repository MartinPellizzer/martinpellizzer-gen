    "intro": "Sida retrofracta, commonly known as the smallleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces small, pale pink to white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Sida retrofracta is notable for its fibrous stems, which have been used historically for making rope and textiles."
