    "intro": "Schoenus pilosus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Schoenus pilosus typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in coastal or inland swampy areas."
