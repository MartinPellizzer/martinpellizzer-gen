    "intro": "Schaueria spicata, commonly known as the spiky lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows from a bulb and produces strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Schaueria spicata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
