    "intro": "Sidalcea aspleniifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and emit a mild, soapy scent. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native plant landscapes."
