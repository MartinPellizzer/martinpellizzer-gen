    "intro": "Sagittaria chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and shallow water bodies, where it forms dense underwater stands. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its small, white flowers appear in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Sagittaria chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
