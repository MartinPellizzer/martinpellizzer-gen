It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a stem that is usually branched and covered with small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella schumannii is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its unique water-storing tissues."
