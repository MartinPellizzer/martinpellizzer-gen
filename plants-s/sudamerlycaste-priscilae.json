    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste priscilae, commonly known as the ancient South American lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking violet petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
