    "intro": "Stemonurus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stemonurus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
