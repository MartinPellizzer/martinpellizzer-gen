    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, often white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Saxifraga cernua is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
