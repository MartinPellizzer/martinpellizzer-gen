    "intro": "Saracha biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered saracha, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Saracha biflora is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
