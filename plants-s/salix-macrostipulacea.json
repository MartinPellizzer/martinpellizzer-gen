    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salix macrostipulaclea, commonly known as the large-stipule willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its bark is thin and smooth, often peeling in strips, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix macrostipulacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
