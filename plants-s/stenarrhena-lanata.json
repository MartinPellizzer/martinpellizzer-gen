    "intro": "Stenarrhena lanata, commonly known as the woolly stenarrhena, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
