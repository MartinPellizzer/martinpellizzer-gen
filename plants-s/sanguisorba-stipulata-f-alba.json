    "intro": "Sanguisorba stipulata f. alba, commonly known as white-stemmed dropwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are typically white or pale green in color, distinguishing it from the more commonly known red-stemmed varieties. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, though the white form is less common. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalk. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
