    "intro": "Salix glauca var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flower willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in wet meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing stream banks."
