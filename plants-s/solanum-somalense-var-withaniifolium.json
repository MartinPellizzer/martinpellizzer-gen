    "intro": "Solanum somalense var. withaniifolium, commonly known as the Somali nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
