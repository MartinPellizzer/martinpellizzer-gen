    "intro": "Schefflera cracens, commonly known as the African laceleaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by black, spherical berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera cracens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
