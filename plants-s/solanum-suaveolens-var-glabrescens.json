It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the evening. Its berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, so caution is advised. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
