The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and narrow, often blue-green leaves adapted to withstand drought. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, papery fruits. Senecio salsuginosus is well-suited to saline and rocky soils, making it a common species in coastal and desert environments."
