It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to pink. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice bungei is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and drought tolerance."
