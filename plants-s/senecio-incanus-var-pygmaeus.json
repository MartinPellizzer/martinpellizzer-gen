It features narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
