It features a single, unbranched stem that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a smooth, grayish-brown trunk. Its leaves are large, pinnate, and often have a bluish-green color with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of dark blue to black berries. It is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, exhibiting tolerance to salt spray and flooding."
