    "intro": "Sida vesicaria, commonly known as blisterweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often glandular and sticky. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Sida vesicaria is known for its irritant properties due to the presence of toxic compounds on its leaves and stems."
