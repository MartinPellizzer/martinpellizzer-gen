    "intro": "Suaeda linearis var. salsa, commonly known as saltbush or sea spinach, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of soil salinity. The plant has small, linear leaves that reduce water loss and aid in salt excretion. It produces small yellow flowers and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of salt-tolerant ecosystems."
