    "intro": "Sutera arcuata, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sutera arcuata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and adaptability have made it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
