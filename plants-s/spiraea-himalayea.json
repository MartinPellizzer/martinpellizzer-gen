It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, arching stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraea himalayea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
