    "intro": "Senecio aegadensis, commonly known as the Aegean Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Aegean Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
