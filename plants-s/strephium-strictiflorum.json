It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
