    "intro": "Sideritis clandestina subsp. cyllenea, commonly known as the Greek heath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece and parts of the Balkans. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
