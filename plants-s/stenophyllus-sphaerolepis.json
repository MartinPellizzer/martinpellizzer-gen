    "intro": "Stenophyllus sphaerolepis, commonly known as the globe-leaf stenophyllus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive globose (globular) leaves, which are thick and leathery, often appearing rounded or spherical. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits. Stenophyllus sphaerolepis is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
