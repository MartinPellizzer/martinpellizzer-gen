    "intro": "Sanguisorba sanguisorba subvar. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf bloodwort, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. The subspecies microcarpa is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form."
