    "intro": "Selaginella trisulcata, commonly known as the three-ribbed spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear the sporangia for spore production. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Selaginella trisulcata is a vascular plant that exhibits both sporophyte and gametophyte stages in its life cycle."
