    "intro": "Soda schweinfurthii, commonly known as desert sand sage, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its small, needle-like leaves reduce water loss through transpiration. Soda schweinfurthii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
