    "intro": "Smyrnium aegopodioides, commonly known as the lesser cow-wheat, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a taproot system and produces seeds in small, dry fruits. It is often found in association with other umbelliferous species and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
