    "intro": "Stipa ventanicola, commonly known as the coastal needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand saline and drought conditions. Stipa ventanicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
