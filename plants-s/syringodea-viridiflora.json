It is characterized by its striking emerald-green petals and unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant belongs to the family Syringodeaceae and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms that appear during the wet season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Syringodea viridiflora is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem."
