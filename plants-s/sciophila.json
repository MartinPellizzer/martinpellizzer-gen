    "intro": "Sciophila, commonly known as the shade-loving orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Sciophila species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. They have specialized roots that help them absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Sciophila species are considered rare or endangered."
