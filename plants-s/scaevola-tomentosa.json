    "intro": "Scaevola tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly fanflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Scaevola tomentosa is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade."
