    "intro": "Samuela carnerosana, commonly known as the Carnerosan samuela, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common adaptation in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
