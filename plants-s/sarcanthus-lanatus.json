    "intro": "Sarcanthus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"lanatus,\" meaning \"woolly\" in Latin. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Sarcanthus lanatus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
