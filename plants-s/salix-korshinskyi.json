    "intro": "Salix korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
