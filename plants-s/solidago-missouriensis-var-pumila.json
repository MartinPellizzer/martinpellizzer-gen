    "intro": "Solidago missouriensis var. pumila, commonly known as the Missouri golden tickseed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the central United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bright yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. This variety is closely related to other Solidago species but is distinguished by its smaller size and unique floral structure."
