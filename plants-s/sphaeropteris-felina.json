    "intro": "Sphaeropteris felina, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bright green, with a slightly serrated edge, and can grow up to several meters in length. Sphaeropteris felina is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual appeal and air-purifying qualities."
