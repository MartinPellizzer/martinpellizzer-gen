    "intro": "Stapelia olivacea, commonly known as the olive-stemmed stapelia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with a pale green or olive hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, waxy texture. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia olivacea is well adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
