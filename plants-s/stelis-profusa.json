    "intro": "Stelis profusa, commonly known as the clustered spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has aerial roots that help it attach to trees or other substrates, a common feature among epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Stelis profusa is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on the canopy layers of trees."
