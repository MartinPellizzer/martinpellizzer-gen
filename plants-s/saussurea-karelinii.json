    "intro": "Saussurea karelinii, commonly known as the Karakorum snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in harsh mountainous conditions. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to its ecological significance and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
