It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in whorls of three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Schinus paraguariensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
