    "intro": "Salix chloroclados, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are pale green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow-green in hue. Its bark is smooth and gray, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Salix chloroclados is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands."
