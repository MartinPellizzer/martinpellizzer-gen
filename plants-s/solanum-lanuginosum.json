    "intro": "Solanum lanuginosum, commonly known as the fuzzy nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum lanuginosum is often found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
