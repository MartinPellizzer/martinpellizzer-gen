It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants known for their ornamental and sometimes medicinal uses. The plant features grass-like leaves with a vibrant green color, and its flowers are small and clustered, often in spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though its ecological role in its native habitat remains understudied."
