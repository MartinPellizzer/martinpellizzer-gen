    "intro": "Solanum floribundum, commonly known as the everblooming nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom continuously throughout the growing season. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature, often containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to various climates. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution."
