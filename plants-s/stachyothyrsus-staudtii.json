    "intro": "Stachyothyrsus staudtii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round fruits. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
