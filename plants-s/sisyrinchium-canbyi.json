    "intro": "Sisyrinchium canbyi, commonly known as the canby's blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. It blooms in early spring and is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological importance to pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
