    "intro": "Salix viminalis subsp. veriviminalis, commonly known as willow herb, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes and riverbanks. The species is valued for its rapid growth and has been used historically for basket-making and as a source of flexible willow."
