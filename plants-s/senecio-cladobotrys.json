    "intro": "Senecio cladobotrys, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, branching stems. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine, white hairs. It produces small yellow flowers in summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance."
