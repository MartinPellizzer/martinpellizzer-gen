    "intro": "Styrax lasiocalyx, commonly known as the rough-stalked styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, sticky, brownish capsules that contain its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and pleasant floral scent."
