    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 landaueri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and delicate floral display."
