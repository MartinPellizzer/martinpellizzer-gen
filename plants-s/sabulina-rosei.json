    "intro": "Sabulina rosei, commonly known as the rose saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Sabulina rosei is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
