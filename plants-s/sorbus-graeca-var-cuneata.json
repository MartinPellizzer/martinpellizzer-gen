    "intro": "Sorbus graeca var. cuneata, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in rocky or limestone soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
