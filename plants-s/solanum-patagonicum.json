    "intro": "Solanum patagonicum, commonly known as the Patagonian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing solanine and other alkaloids. Solanum patagonicum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
