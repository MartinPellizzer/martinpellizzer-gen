    "intro": "Scilla madeirensis var. melliodora, commonly known as the Madeiran squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Azores and Madeira Islands. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return year after year with minimal care. The variety melliodora is distinguished by its sweet, honey-like fragrance, which adds an aromatic element to its ornamental value."
