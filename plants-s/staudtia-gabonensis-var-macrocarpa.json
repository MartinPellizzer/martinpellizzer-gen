    "intro": "Staudtia gabonensis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Gabon staudtia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are borne on long, slender stalks. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral display makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
