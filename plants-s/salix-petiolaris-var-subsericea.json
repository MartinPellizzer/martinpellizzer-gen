    "intro": "Salix petiolaris var. subsericea, commonly known as the silky willow, is a variant of the petiolaris willow species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down. The leaves are typically bright green on the upper surface and silvery-white underneath, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a range of soil conditions."
