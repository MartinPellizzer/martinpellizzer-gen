    "intro": "Solori, commonly known as the \"sunflower,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower heads that follow the sun's movement during the day, a phenomenon known as heliotropism. The plant has a robust stem with rough, hairy leaves that are alternate in arrangement. Its flowers develop into composite seed heads containing numerous sunflower seeds. Solori is native to North America but has been naturalized in many regions around the world."
