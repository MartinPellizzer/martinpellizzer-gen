    "intro": "Saussurea hamanakaensis, commonly known as the Japanese snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Saussurea hamanakaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
