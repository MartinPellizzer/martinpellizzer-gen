    "intro": "Sitanion albescens, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Sitanion albescens is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
