    "intro": "Sorghum timorense, commonly known as Timor sorghum, is a species native to the island of Timor. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stalks and small, two-lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are used for food and feed. Due to its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, it is an important crop in arid and semi-arid regions."
