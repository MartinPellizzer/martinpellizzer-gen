    "intro": "Salix pellita, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, often wet environments. It is also notable for its role in traditional medicine, with its bark containing salicin, a compound similar to aspirin. The white willow is an important species in riparian ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife."
