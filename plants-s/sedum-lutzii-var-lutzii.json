    "intro": "Sedum lutzii var. lutzii, commonly known as the Lutz's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
