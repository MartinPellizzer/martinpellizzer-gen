    "intro": "Spiraea virginiana, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its dense, rounded form. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Spiraea virginiana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and meadows."
