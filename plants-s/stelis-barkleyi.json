    "intro": "Stelis barkleyi, commonly known as the Barkley's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis barkleyi is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests."
