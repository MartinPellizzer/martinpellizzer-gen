It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray florets and robust, often spiny stems. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Staavia species are perennial herbs that produce small, dandelion-like seed heads. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
