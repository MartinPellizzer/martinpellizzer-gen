    "intro": "Saccolabium cortinatum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot environments. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of desert and semi-desert habitats."
