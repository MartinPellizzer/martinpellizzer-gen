    "intro": "Sorbus arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 5 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Sorbus arbuscula is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
