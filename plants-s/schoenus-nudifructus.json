    "intro": "Schoenus nudifructus, commonly known as the naked-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, and it does not have true fruits, hence its common name. Schoenus nudifructus thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies."
