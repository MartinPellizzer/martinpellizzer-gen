    "intro": "Sabina vulgaris var. jarkendensis, commonly known as the Jarkendensis juniper, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
