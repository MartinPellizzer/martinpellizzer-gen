    "intro": "Silene repens var. typica, commonly known as the prostrate campion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Silene repens var. typica is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
