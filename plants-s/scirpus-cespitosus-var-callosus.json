    "intro": "Scirpus cespitosus var. callosus, commonly known as the rough bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that grow in water or very wet soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, bristle-like hairs. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist environments, playing an important role in wetland ecosystems."
