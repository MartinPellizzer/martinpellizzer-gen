    "intro": "Salix silesiaca f. trichocarpa, commonly known as the Trichocarpa willow, is a botanical variant of the Silesian willow. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Salix silesiaca. This form is typically found in moist, temperate environments, often near streams or in wet meadows. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces catkins as its primary floral structure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
