    "intro": "Sporobolus diandrus, commonly known as sanddrop grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus diandrus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an important forage plant for livestock in its native range."
