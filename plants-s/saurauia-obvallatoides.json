It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are oval to elliptical in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.
