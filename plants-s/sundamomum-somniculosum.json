    "intro": "Sundamomum somniculosum, commonly known as the sleepyhead plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink, often emitting a mild fragrance. The plant has a unique ability to close its leaves at night, a trait that gives it its common name. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific care requirements."
