    "intro": "Stipa avenoides, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of narrow, awned lemmas, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with a fine layer of hairs. Stipa avenoides is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
