    "intro": "Silene italica var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra violet, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in high-elevation habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and adaptations to harsh mountain environments."
