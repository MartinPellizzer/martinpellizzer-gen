    "intro": "Salix palibinii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix palibinii is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
