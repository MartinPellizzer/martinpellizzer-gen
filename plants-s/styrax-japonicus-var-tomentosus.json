    "intro": "Styrax japonicus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its unique foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to woodland and landscape settings."
