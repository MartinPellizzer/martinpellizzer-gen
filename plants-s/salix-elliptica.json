    "intro": "Salix elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, cone-like female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
