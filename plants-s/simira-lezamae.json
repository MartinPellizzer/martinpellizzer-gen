It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
