    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica subsp. tenuirostrata, commonly known as the narrow-beaked saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs, ledges, and woodland edges. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early summer. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf shape and floral structure compared to the typical form. Saxifraga pensylvanica subsp. tenuirostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
