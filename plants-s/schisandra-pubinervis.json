It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, five-lobed leaves with pubescent (hairy) surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both traditional medicine and horticultural studies. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often climbing through dense vegetation."
