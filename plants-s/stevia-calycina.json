    "intro": "Stevia calycina, commonly known as the \"sweetleaf\" or \"Stevia leaf,\" is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Stevia calycina is widely cultivated for its sweet-tasting leaves, which are used as a natural alternative to sugar in various food and beverage products."
