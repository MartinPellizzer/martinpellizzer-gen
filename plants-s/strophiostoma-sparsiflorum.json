    "intro": "Strophiostoma sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered starwort, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, enhancing its ability to retain moisture. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in loose, umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
