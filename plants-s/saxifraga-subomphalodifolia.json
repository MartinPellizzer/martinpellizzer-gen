    "intro": "Saxifraga subomphalodifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a small perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats or low-growing clusters. The plant features hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer. Saxifraga subomphalodifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
