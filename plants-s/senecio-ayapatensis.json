    "intro": "Senecio ayapatensis, commonly known as Ayapatan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio ayapatensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
