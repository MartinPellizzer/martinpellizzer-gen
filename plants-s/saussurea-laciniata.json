It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear numerous small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
