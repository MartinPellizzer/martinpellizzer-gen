    "intro": "Strychnos araguaensis, commonly known as the Aragua strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. Strychnos araguaensis is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. However, like many members of its genus, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
