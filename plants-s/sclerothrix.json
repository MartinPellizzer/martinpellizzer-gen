    "intro": "Sclerothrix, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, often showy flowers that are adapted to grow in rocky or crevice habitats. The plants typically have a short, rhizomatous stem and produce small, clustered flowers with intricate petal structures. Sclerothrix species are native to regions with Mediterranean climates, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Their botanical features make them well-suited for xerophytic environments, where they thrive with minimal water and nutrient availability."
