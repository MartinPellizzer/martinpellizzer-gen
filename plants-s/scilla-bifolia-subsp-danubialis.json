It features grass-like basal leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more robust growth compared to other Scilla species."
