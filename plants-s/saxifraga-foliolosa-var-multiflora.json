    "intro": "Saxifraga foliolosa var. multiflora, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens in cooler climates."
