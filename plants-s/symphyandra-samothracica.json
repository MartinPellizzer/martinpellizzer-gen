    "intro": "Symphyandra samothracica, commonly known as the Samothracean starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Greek island of Samothrace. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
