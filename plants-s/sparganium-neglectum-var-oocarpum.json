    "intro": "Sparganium neglectum var. oocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr rush, is a wetland plant characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and cylindrical, spiky inflorescences. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spiny spikes, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The varietal form oocarpum is distinguished by its unique fruiting structures, which are more elongated and less branched compared to other varieties of Sparganium."
