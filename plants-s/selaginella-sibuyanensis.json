    "intro": "Selaginella sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan spike moss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in cones. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it faces significant threats to its survival."
