    "intro": "Solanum lyratum var. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the yellow-fruited nightshade, is a variant of the creeping nightshade plant. It is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that transition into yellow berries, which are edible but often have a mild, bitter taste. Its leaves are ovate with a waxy surface and can be used in traditional medicine. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique fruit color."
