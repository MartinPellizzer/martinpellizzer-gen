    "intro": "Sideroxylon amygdalinum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions."
