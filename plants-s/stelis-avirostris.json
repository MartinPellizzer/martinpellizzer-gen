    "intro": "Stelis avirostris, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences that produce white or pale yellow blooms. Stelis avirostris is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
