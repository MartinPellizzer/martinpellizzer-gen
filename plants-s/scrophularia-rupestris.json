    "intro": "Scrophularia rupestris, commonly known as the rock scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and gravelly slopes. The plant features erect, branched stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are tubular, typically purple or pink, and are arranged in spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer. Scrophularia rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
