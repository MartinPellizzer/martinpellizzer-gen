    "intro": "Sorghum dora, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short stems and narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that can range in color from pale green to red or purple, depending on the variety. Sorghum dora is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important crop in arid regions. It is also used for forage, grain, and biofuel production."
