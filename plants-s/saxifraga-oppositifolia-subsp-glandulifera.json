    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular leaves, which are covered in tiny, secretory structures. It thrives in rocky and barren environments, often growing on tundra or mountain slopes. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient member of polar ecosystems."
