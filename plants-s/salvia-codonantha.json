    "intro": "Salvia codonantha, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Salvia codonantha thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate, ethereal appearance."
