    "intro": "Stachys laxa, commonly known as the slender hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, hairy stems that often sprawl along the ground. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Its small, pale purple to pinkish flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in rocky areas, and is adapted to temperate climates."
