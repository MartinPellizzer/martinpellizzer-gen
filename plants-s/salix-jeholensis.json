    "intro": "Salix jeholensis, commonly known as the Jehol willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is adapted to grow in moist, temperate environments. Salix jeholensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
