    "intro": "Sterculia villosa, commonly known as the hairy sterculia, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in panicles, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in some regions for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
