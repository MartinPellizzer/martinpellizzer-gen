    "intro": "Salix megalostachya, commonly known as the giant willow or big-stemmed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, drooping catkins, which are typical features of willow species. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in wetland environments, such as swamps and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
