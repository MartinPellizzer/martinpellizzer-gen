    "intro": "Senaea janeirensis, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Senaea janeirensis plays a vital role in the ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
