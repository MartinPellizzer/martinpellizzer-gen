    "intro": "Stigmatodon vexatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. Stigmatodon vexatus is known for its rapid growth and is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range. Its botanical features make it a notable example of the adaptive strategies of tropical flora."
