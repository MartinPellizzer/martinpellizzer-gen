    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. amentifer, commonly known as saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, playing an important role in stabilizing coastal soils."
