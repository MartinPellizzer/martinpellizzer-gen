    "intro": "Scirpus urvillei, commonly known as the Urville's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in stabilizing the soil in aquatic environments. Scirpus urvillei is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in brackish or freshwater habitats."
