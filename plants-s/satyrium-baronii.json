    "intro": "Satyrium baronii, commonly known as the Baron's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a single, upright stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive hooded labellum and a spurred ovary, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
