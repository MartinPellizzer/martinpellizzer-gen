    "intro": "Solidago arguta var. scabrella, commonly known as the rough goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and often have a silvery or grayish underside. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late season."
