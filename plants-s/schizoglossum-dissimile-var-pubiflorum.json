    "intro": "Schizoglossum dissimile var. pubiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered schizoglossum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, hairy sepals that distinguish it from other varieties. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is adapted to the sparse vegetation of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
