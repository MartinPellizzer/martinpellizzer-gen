These plants are native to Europe and parts of Asia, and they are typically found in woodland and grassland habitats. Stevenorchis species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plants have slender stems and are often short-lived, with a life cycle that includes a dormant phase. Their unique floral structure and ecological role make them an important subject of study in botany and conservation."
