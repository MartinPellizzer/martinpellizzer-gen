    "intro": "Stellularia media var. neglecta, commonly known as the slender starworts, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the genus Stellularia. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows, often growing in dense colonies. Due to its delicate structure and preference for wet environments, it is an important indicator species for wetland health."
