    "intro": "Spirodela biperforata, commonly known as the two-perforate water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, perforated holes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Spirodela biperforata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
