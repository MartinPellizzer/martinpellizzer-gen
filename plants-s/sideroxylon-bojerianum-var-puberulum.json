    "intro": "Sideroxylon bojerianum var. puberulum, commonly known as the velvet wood or Persian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood with a dark brown to blackish color and a fine, even texture. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are leathery and covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
