    "intro": "Sabulina attica subsp. attica, commonly known as the Greek sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in shades of white or pale pink. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
