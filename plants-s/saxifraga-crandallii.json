    "intro": "Saxifraga crandallii, commonly known as Crandall's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga crandallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
