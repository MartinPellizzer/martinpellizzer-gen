    "intro": "Sansevieria fasciata, commonly known as the Tiger Plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green with prominent yellow or white tiger-like stripes. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in low-light conditions and requiring minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water and contributing to its drought tolerance. Sansevieria fasciata is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, enhancing indoor air quality."
