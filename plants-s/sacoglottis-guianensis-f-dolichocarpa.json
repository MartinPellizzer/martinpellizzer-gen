    "intro": "Sacoglottis guianensis f. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed arrowleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, though it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by local communities. This variety is distinguished by its longer stems compared to other forms of Sacoglottis guianensis."
