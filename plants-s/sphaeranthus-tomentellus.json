    "intro": "Sphaeranthus tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in sandy soils. Sphaeranthus tomentellus is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
