    "intro": "Sempervivum soboliferum, commonly known as the Wooly Bear or the Mountain House Sempervivum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to the Pyrenees and the Alps, where it thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, woolly coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. This hardy succulent is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
