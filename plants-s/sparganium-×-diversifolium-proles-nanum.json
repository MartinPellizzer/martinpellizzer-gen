    "intro": "Sparganium \u00d7 diversifolium proles nanum, commonly known as the dwarf bur-reed, is a compact aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, yellowish flowers emerging from the water surface. Its small size and dense growth habit make it an effective stabilizer of aquatic soils. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
