    "intro": "Spartothamnus puberulus, commonly known as the woolly spartothamnus, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine pubescence, which provides additional protection against intense sunlight. Spartothamnus puberulus is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
