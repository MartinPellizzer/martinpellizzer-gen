    "intro": "Selaginella caulescens var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to East Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ability to retain moisture make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
