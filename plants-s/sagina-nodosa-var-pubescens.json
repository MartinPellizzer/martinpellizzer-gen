    "intro": "Sagina nodosa var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry meadows. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an adaptable species in harsh climates."
