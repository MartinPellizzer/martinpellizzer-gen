    "intro": "Scirpus cespitosus subsp. germanicus, commonly known as the German bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. It is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along slow-moving streams. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
