It consists of approximately 100 species, predominantly found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are typically herbaceous, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. They often thrive in moist, acidic soils and are commonly found in bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. Sesleria species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
