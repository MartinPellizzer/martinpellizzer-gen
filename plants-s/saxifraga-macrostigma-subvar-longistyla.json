    "intro": "Saxifraga macrostigma subvar. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly toothed margin. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subvariety is distinguished by its elongated styles, which are longer than those of the typical variety, contributing to its unique botanical identity."
