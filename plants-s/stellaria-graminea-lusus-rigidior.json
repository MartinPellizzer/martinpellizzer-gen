    "intro": "Stellaria graminea lusus rigidior, commonly known as rigid starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
