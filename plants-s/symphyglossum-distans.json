    "intro": "Symphyglossum distans, commonly known as the distant lips orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, lip-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are relatively short and often bear the showy inflorescence. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
