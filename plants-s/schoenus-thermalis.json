It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. This species thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its growth is adapted to the saline and humid conditions of its native habitat. Schoenus thermalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
