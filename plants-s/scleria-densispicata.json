    "intro": "Scleria densispicata, commonly known as the dense-spined sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. Scleria densispicata is native to southern Africa and thrives in wet or marshy environments. Its dense, spiky inflorescence gives it its common name and makes it visually distinct among other sedges."
