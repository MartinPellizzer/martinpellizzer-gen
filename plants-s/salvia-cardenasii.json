    "intro": "Salvia cardenasii, commonly known as Cardenas' sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native gardens. Salvia cardenasii is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
