    "intro": "Spiraea daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng spiraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Spiraea daochengensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
