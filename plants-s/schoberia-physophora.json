    "intro": "Schoberia physophora, commonly known as the redroot sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and succulent stems that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its leaves are generally narrow and fleshy, adapted for water conservation. Schoberia physophora is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats."
