    "intro": "Selago pinea, commonly known as the sand pine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, cone-like fruits. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Selago pinea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
