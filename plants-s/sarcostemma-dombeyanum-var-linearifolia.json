It features slender, woody stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are elongated, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
