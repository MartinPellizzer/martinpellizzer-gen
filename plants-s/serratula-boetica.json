    "intro": "Serratula boetica, commonly known as the Alpine sowthistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are hairy and often have a serrated edge, giving it its scientific name. Serratula boetica is known for its yellow flowers that bloom in summer and its historical use in traditional medicine."
