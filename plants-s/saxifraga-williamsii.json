    "intro": "Saxifraga williamsii, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette, and it produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in the summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga williamsii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
