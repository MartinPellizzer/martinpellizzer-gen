    "intro": "Securidaca macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked devil's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant produces legume-like pods containing seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
