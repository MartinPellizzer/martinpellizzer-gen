    "intro": "Stizolobium, commonly known as the African legume or African acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and compound leaves. Many species produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, and they often have thorned stems as a defense mechanism. Stizolobium species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them important components of savanna ecosystems. They also play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in their native habitats."
