    "intro": "Sophora hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in a leathery pod and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The hairy sophora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in soil stabilization."
