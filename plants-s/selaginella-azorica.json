    "intro": "Selaginella azorica, commonly known as the Azorean spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the Azores. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spiky leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant is adapted to humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. It has a unique ability to survive desiccation, which allows it to thrive in its rocky, moist habitats. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
