    "intro": "Stachys polygonatum, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a velvety texture. The plant produces spikes of violet or blue flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Stachys polygonatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
