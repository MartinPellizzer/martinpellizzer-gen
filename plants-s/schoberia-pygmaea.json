    "intro": "Schoberia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
