    "intro": "Silphium perfoliatum var. perfoliatum, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
