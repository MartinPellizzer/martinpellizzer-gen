    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 munbyana, commonly known as the hybrid African milk plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often foul-smelling flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy, greenish-yellow to reddish-brown flowers that resemble dead animal tissue, a feature evolved to attract specific pollinators. Stapelia \u00d7 munbyana is a hybrid between Stapelia hirsuta and Stapelia hereroensis, resulting in a plant with a combination of traits from both parents. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
