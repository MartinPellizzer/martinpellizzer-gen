    "intro": "Spartina \u00d7 neyrautii, commonly known as the hybrid cordgrass, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Spartina alterniflora and Spartina foliosa. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like structure with dense, overlapping leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is typically found in intertidal zones, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. Spartina \u00d7 neyrautii plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and reducing erosion. However, its invasive potential in certain regions has raised ecological concerns."
