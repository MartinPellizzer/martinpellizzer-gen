It features compact, aromatic foliage that is typically gray-green in color, with silvery white undersides. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscaping."
