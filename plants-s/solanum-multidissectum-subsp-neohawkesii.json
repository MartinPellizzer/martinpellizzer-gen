    "intro": "Solanum multidissectum subsp. neohawkesii, commonly known as the Hawkes' dissected nightshade, is a rare and striking member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments. Its fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, attracting various pollinators and seed dispersers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
