    "intro": "Secamone ligustrifolia subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved secamone, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
