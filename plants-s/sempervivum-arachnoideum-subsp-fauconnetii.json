    "intro": "Sempervivum arachnoideum subsp. fauconnetii, commonly known as the spider plant or rock rose, is a low-growing succulent native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for alpine and Mediterranean gardens."
