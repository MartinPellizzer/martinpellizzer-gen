It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and coastal areas. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Statice capensis is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
