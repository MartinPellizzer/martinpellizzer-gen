    "intro": "Saussurea parviflora var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-flowered snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, dry conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
