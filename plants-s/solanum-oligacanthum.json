It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and small, lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
