    "intro": "Solanum torrecillasense, commonly known as the Torrecillas nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Ecuador. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its restricted distribution and limited study, it remains a relatively obscure species within the Solanum genus."
