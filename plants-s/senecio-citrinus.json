It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, spherical flower heads that resemble small pincushions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green leaves beneath the flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Senecio citrinus is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
