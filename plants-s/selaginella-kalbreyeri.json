    "intro": "Selaginella kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct morphology, featuring a creeping rhizome with upright, linear leaves that are often spirally arranged. Its sporophyte stage produces microsporangia and megasporangia, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella kalbreyeri is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
