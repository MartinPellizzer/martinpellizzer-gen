    "intro": "Striga humifusa, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as sorghum and millet. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to Africa, where it is a significant agricultural pest. Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for years. Due to its invasive nature, it poses a major challenge to food security in affected regions."
