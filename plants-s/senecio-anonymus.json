It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Senecio anonymus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
