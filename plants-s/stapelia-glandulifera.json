    "intro": "Stapelia glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, meaty flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a waxy texture. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia glandulifera is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in low-water conditions."
