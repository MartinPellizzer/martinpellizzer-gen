    "intro": "Suaeda mollis, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are adapted to disperse in salty environments. Suaeda mollis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
