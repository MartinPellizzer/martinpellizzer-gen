    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. bolivianum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, pointed leaves. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is adapted to cold, dry climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
