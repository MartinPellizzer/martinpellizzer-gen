    "intro": "Salgada, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Salgada belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae. Its ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions makes it a hardy choice for seaside gardens."
