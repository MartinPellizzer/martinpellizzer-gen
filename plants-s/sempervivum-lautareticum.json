    "intro": "Sempervivum lautareticum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Alps. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is often found growing in crevices and on stone surfaces, where it can tolerate harsh weather conditions. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
