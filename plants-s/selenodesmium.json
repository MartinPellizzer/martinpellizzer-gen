    "intro": "Selenodesmium, commonly known as the \"moonlight fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often bioluminescent-like appearance, which is due to the presence of certain pigments in its tissues. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selenodesmium species are noted for their small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. These plants are of interest to botanists due to their unique adaptations to low-light conditions and their role in specific ecological niches."
