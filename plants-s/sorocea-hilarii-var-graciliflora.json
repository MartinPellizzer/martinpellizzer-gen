    "intro": "Sorocea hilarii var. graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered sorocea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its slender, lance-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
