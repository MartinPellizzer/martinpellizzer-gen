    "intro": "Selaginella sylvatica, commonly known as the forest spikemoss, is a vascular fern ally that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often bright green and have a waxy coating. Selaginella sylvatica reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This species is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
