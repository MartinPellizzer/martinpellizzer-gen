    "intro": "Selliguea erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright red, segmented capsules that mature in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its leaves are elongated and gradually taper to a point, with a distinct midrib. Selliguea erythrocarpa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
