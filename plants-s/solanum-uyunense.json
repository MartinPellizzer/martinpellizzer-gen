    "intro": "Solanum uyunense, commonly known as the Yungan nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Yungas region of Bolivia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening. Its berries are typically red or orange when ripe and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its restricted habitat, Solanum uyunense is considered a rare and poorly studied species."
