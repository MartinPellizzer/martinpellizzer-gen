    "intro": "Schedonorus trichodes, commonly known as the fine-stemmed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Schedonorus trichodes is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
