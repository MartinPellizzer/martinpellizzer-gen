It is characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetrical leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and features yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while the stems are woody and often branched. Senecio disparifolius is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
