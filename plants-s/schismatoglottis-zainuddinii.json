    "intro": "Schismatoglottis zainuddinii, commonly known as the Zainuddin's schismatoglottis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
