    "intro": "Styrax duidae subsp. neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina styrax, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of northern South America. This plant is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, adapting well to the humid and shaded conditions of its habitat. The bark of the Neblina styrax contains aromatic compounds, which have been used traditionally by indigenous communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
