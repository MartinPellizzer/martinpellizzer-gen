    "intro": "Stipa dongicola, commonly known as the Mongolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Stipa dongicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
