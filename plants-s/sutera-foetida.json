    "intro": "Sutera foetida, commonly known as the stinking silk cotton tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed pods. Its most notable botanical feature is the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, which is believed to deter herbivores. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types."
