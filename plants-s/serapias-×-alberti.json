    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 alberti, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Serapias acaulis and Serapias grandiflora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly in regions with moist, calcareous soils. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
