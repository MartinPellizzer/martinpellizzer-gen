    "intro": "Solanum denudatum, commonly known as the naked nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically edible when ripe, though they contain toxic compounds in their raw state. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Solanum denudatum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
