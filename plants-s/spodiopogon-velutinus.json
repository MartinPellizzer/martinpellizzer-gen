    "intro": "Spodiopogon velutinus, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, soft leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Spodiopogon velutinus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
