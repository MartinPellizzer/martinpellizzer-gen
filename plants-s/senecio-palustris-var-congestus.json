    "intro": "Senecio palustris var. congestus, commonly known as swamp ragwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its dense flowering heads and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
