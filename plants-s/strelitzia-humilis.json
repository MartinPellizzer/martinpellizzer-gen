    "intro": "Strelitzia humilis, commonly known as the common bird-of-paradise, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, banana-like leaves and dramatic, bird-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which bloom in summer, consist of a blue-violet lower petal and a bright yellow upper petal that resemble a bird in flight. Strelitzia humilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
