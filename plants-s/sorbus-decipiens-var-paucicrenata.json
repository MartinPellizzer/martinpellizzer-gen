    "intro": "Sorbus decipiens var. paucicrenata, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in challenging climates."
