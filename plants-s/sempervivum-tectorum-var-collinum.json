It features dense rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are adapted to retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at high altitudes."
