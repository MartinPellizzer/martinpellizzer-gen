    "intro": "Schoenoplectus inclinatus, commonly known as the leaning bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often lean or bow, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of greenish-white. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy environments. Schoenoplectus inclinatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
