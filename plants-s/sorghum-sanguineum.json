It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and striking red to purple pigmentation in its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its unique coloration, it is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
