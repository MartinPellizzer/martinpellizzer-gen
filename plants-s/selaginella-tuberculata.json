    "intro": "Selaginella tuberculata, commonly known as the clubmoss or spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
