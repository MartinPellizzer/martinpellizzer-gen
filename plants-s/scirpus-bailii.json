    "intro": "Scirpus bailii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize shorelines. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus bailii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
