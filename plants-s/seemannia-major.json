    "intro": "Seemannia major, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing shade over water surfaces. The plant's flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals that attract pollinators such as beetles and bees. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. Seemannia major plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
