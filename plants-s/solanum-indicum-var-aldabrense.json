    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. aldabrense, commonly known as the Aldabra nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, exhibiting succulent stems and thick leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark red color and contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
