    "intro": "Sphenogyne ciliaris, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets and bloom in the summer months. Sphenogyne ciliaris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
