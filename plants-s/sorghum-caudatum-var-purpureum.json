    "intro": "Sorghum caudatum var. purpureum, commonly known as purple top sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking purple-tinted leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic value. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its flowering spikes, which appear at the end of the growing season, add to its visual appeal and make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
