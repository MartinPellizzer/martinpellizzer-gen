    "intro": "Sedum edule, commonly known as little mouse-ear or stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, or pink, typically during the summer months. Sedum edule is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. It is also edible, with a mild, slightly sweet flavor, making it a potential food source in certain regions."
