    "intro": "Salix tenuijulis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it useful for erosion control and habitat restoration."
