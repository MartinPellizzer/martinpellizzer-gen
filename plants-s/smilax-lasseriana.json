    "intro": "Smilax lasseriana, commonly known as the red-berried smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible but often have a bitter taste. Smilax lasseriana is often found in moist woodlands and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
