    "intro": "Smilacina henryi, commonly known as Henry's greenbrier, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a member of the Smilacaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, often fragrant, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface, while its stems are covered in fine, hooked hairs that aid in climbing. Smilacina henryi is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
