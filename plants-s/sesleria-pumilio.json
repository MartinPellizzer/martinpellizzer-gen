    "intro": "Sesleria pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that produce delicate, feathery inflorescences in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, bluish-green hue. Sesleria pumilio thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
