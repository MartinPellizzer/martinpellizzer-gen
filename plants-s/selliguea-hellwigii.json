    "intro": "Selliguea hellwigii, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Its spores are released from small, club-shaped sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Selliguea hellwigii is a hardy species that is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
