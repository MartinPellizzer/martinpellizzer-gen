    "intro": "Saxifraga marshallii var. typica, commonly known as the Marshall's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of the Appalachian Mountains. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valued addition to native plant collections."
