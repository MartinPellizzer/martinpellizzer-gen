    "intro": "Syntherisma corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered syntherism, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in compact corymbs, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
