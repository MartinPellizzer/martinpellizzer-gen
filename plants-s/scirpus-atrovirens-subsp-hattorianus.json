    "intro": "Scirpus atrovirens subsp. hattorianus, commonly known as the Hattorian bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are usually green to reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. It is also an important food source for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
