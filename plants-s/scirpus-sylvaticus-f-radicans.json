    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus f. radicans, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands in moist soils. The plant features tall, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating on the surface of shallow water. This variant is particularly adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
