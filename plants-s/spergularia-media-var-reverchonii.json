    "intro": "Spergularia media var. reverchonii, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves adapted to retain moisture. The plant produces pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal pathways. This variety is particularly resilient to salt spray and drought, making it well-suited for harsh environmental conditions."
