It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, rounded berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its habitat and morphology, it is often found in rocky, arid environments at elevations above 3,000 meters."
