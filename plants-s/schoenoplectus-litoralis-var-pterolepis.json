    "intro": "Schoenoplectus litoralis var. pterolepis, commonly known as the coastal bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments along coastal areas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense stands, forming part of the vegetation in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowering spikes are usually borne at the top of the plant, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. This variant is well-suited to saline and brackish water conditions, contributing to the ecological stability of coastal wetlands."
