    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua var. humilis, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
