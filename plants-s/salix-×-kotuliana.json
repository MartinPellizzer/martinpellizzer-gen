    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 kotuliana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
