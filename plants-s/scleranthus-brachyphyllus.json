It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss. Scleranthus brachyphyllus is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
