    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon sagraeanum f. faustinum, commonly known as the Faustin's stigmaphyllon, is a rare and unique plant native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves. The plant exhibits a distinctive growth pattern, with thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped foliage that can reach up to 30 cm in length. It produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
