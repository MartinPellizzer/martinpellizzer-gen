    "intro": "Schoenus tepperi, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly pointed at the tips. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, a characteristic feature of many grasses. Schoenus tepperi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
