    "intro": "Silene caesia, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene caesia thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its aquatic and semi-aquatic environment."
