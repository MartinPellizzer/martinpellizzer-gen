    "intro": "Scleria parvula, commonly known as the small bulrush, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds or in swampy areas. Its small, three-lobed flowers are often clustered at the tips of the stems, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse via wind or water. Scleria parvula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in wetland habitats."
