    "intro": "Sinacalia henryi, commonly known as the Henry's sinacalia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. Native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sinacalia henryi is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
