    "intro": "Sida terminalis, commonly known as the cottonwood plant, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, and its leaves are usually ovate with a hairy texture. Sida terminalis is known for its fibrous stems, which have been used historically for making ropes and textiles. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
