    "intro": "Sorbus vallusensis, commonly known as the Valles Mountains rowan, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures, and it often grows in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
