    "intro": "Solanum grandiflorum var. aberrans, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The flowers are typically violet or purple, with five lobed petals, and it produces small, yellowish berries that contain the toxic alkaloid solanin. This variant is notable for its morphological variability, which includes differences in leaf shape, flower size, and fruit characteristics. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
