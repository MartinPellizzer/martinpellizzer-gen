    "intro": "Scandix cornuta, commonly known as the horned scurvygrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is commonly found in sandy or muddy soils. Scandix cornuta is known for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its botanical features are more notable for their structural complexity and ecological adaptation."
