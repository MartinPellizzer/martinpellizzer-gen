    "intro": "Serrafalcus patulus, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Serrafalcus patulus thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity for optimal growth."
