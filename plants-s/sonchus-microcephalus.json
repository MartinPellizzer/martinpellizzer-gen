    "intro": "Sonchus microcephalus, commonly known as small-headed sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
