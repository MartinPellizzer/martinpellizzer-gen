    "intro": "Scaevola filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf fanflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year, especially in coastal regions. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. Scaevola filifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
