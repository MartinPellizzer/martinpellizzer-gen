    "intro": "Scilla congesta, commonly known as the clustered scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Scilla congesta is valued in gardens for its early bloom and ornamental appeal."
