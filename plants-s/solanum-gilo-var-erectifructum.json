    "intro": "Solanum gilo var. erectifructum, commonly known as the purple eggplant, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet-purple fruits that resemble eggs, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine pubescence. The fruit is edible when fully mature and is valued for its unique flavor and nutritional content."
