    "intro": "Seriphium tomentosum, commonly known as the wooly hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to brown ray florets. Seriphium tomentosum typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
