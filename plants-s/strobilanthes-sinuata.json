    "intro": "Strobilanthes sinuata, commonly known as the \"Borneo flame flower,\" is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, which are adapted for pollination by birds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid and tropical climate. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Strobilanthes sinuata is also notable for its short flowering period, which occurs during the rainy season, making it a rare and sought-after species among botanists and plant enthusiasts."
