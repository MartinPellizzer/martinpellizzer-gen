    "intro": "Salix hastata var. apoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
