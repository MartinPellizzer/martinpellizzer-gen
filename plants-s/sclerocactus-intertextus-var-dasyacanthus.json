    "intro": "Sclerocactus intertextus var. dasyacanthus, commonly known as the dense spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a dense covering of stiff, spiny areoles. The plant features pale green to bluish-green stems that are often branched and covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems during the spring. This variety is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with thick, water-storing stems and minimal leaf structure."
