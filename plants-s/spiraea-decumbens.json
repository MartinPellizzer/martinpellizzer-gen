    "intro": "Spiraea decumbens, commonly known as creeping spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators. Its foliage is typically dark green and remains attractive throughout the growing season. Spiraea decumbens is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
