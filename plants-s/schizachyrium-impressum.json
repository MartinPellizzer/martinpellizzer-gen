    "intro": "Schizachyrium impressum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in dry, open habitats. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and distinctive, slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature to a rusty brown color, adding visual interest in the fall. Little bluestem is drought-tolerant and plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in prairie and woodland ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in native plant landscaping."
