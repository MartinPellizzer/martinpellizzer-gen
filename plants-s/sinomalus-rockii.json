    "intro": "Sinomalus rockii, commonly known as the Rock's sinomalus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions in China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens, making it visually striking. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sinomalus rockii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
