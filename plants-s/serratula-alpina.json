    "intro": "Serratula alpina, commonly known as alpine serrata, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are serrated and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Serratula alpina produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
