    "intro": "Salacia leucoclada, commonly known as the white-leaved salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which gives it its common name. Salacia leucoclada is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
