    "intro": "Selaginella hypacantha, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with whorled leaves that are often dark green and slightly curled. Selaginella hypacantha reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
