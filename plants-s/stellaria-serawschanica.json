    "intro": "Stellaria serawschanica, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Stellaria serawschanica is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
