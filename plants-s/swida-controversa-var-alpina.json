    "intro": "Swida controversa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine swida, is a rare and hardy shrub native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical features include hairy stems and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
