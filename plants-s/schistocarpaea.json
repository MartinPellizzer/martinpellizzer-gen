    "intro": "Schistocarpaea, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, exhibiting a range of growth forms from annual herbs to shrubs. Schistocarpaea species are typically found in regions with Mediterranean or semi-arid climates, such as parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The genus is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
