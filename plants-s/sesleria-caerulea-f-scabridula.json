    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea f. scabridula, commonly known as the scabrous blue feather grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, blue-green leaves that are slightly rough to the touch, giving it its \"scabridula\" designation. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale blue to silver flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its fine foliage and subtle floral display, which adds a refined texture to the landscape."
