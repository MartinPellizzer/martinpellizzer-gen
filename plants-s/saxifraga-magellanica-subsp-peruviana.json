    "intro": "Saxifraga magellanica subsp. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of succulent foliage. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
