    "intro": "Solanum kauaiense, commonly known as Kauai nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the native forests of Kauai. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Solanum kauaiense is considered a rare and endangered species."
