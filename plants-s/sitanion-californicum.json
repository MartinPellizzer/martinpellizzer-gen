    "intro": "Sitanion californicum, commonly known as the California buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces tiny, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Sitanion californicum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native pollinators."
