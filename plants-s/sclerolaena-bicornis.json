    "intro": "Sclerolaena bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Sclerolaena bicornis is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in dry, sunny environments."
