    "intro": "Selaginella bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbiferous spikemoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. The plant produces specialized structures called bulbils, which are miniature plants that can develop into new individuals without undergoing sexual reproduction. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Its ability to reproduce vegetatively makes it an important species in ecological studies of plant resilience."
