It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright-colored blooms, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
