    "intro": "Salix, commonly known as willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Salicaceae. It consists of over 300 species, most of which are shrubs or small trees characterized by their slender branches and often zigzagging stems. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and have a pointed tip, and they often have a soft, velvety texture. Willows are known for their early spring growth and are often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. They are also valued for their fast growth and ability to stabilize soil, making them important in ecological restoration projects."
