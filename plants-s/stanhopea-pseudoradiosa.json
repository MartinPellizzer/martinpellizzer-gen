    "intro": "Stanhopea pseudoradiosa, commonly known as the radiosa stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant yellow lip with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth is slow, and it often produces blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
