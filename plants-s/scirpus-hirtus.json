    "intro": "Scirpus hirtus, commonly known as hairy bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus hirtus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
