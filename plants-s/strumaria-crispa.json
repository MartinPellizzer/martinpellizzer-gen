    "intro": "Strumaria crispa, commonly known as the crinkled bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled leaves and bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial species that produces small, edible berries in the autumn, which are often consumed by birds. Strumaria crispa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
