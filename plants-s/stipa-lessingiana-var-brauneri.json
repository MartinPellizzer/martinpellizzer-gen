It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is generally fine and grass-like, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a short layer of hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, wind-resistant structure."
