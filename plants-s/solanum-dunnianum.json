    "intro": "Solanum dunnianum, commonly known as the Dunn's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces berries that are usually yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids, making them harmful to humans and animals. Solanum dunnianum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and botanical research."
