    "intro": "Sagittaria subulata var. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies with its arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that rise above the water surface, followed by dark blue to black berries. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
