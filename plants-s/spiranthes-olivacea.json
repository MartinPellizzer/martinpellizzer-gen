    "intro": "Spiranthes olivacea, commonly known as the olive swamp twayblade, is a species of orchid native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is a herbaceous perennial with a slender, erect stem and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures called bracts. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, giving the plant its characteristic name."
