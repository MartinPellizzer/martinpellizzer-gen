    "intro": "Salix stolonifera f. subpilosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a shrub characterized by its slender, creeping stems that form dense mats. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are softly hairy on both surfaces, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
