    "intro": "Sapium pycnostachys, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange to red fleshy fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its rapid growth and showy autumn foliage. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
