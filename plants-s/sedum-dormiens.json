    "intro": "Sedum dormiens, commonly known as the sleeping sedum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that often lie dormant during dry periods, only becoming active after rainfall. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Sedum dormiens is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
