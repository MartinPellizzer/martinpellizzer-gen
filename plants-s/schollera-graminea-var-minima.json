    "intro": "Schollera graminea var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf schollera, is a compact, low-growing plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a grass-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental element. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and small garden spaces."
