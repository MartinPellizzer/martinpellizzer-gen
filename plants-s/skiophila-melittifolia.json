It is characterized by its distinctive, honeycomb-like inflorescence composed of small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, clustered pattern. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Skiophila melittifolia is pollinated primarily by bees, which are attracted to its nectar-rich flowers."
