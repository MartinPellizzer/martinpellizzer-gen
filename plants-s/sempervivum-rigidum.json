    "intro": "Sempervivum rigidum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is a perennial plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
