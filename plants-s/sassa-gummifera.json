    "intro": "Sassa gummifera, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, pungent roots and leaves that are alternate and often have three lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits. Its roots have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. However, the plant contains toxic compounds, and its use is now largely restricted due to legal and health concerns."
