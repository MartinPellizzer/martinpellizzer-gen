    "intro": "Symphoricarpos symphoricarpos var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features oval, glossy leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The variegated foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
