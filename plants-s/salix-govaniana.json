    "intro": "Salix govaniana, commonly known as the grey willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Salix govaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
