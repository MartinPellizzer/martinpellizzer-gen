    "intro": "Stellaria triandra, commonly known as the starwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Stellaria triandra is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Its simple structure and delicate appearance make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
