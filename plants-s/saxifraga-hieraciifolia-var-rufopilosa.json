It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its distinctive foliage and compact form make it a desirable ornamental plant in rock gardens."
