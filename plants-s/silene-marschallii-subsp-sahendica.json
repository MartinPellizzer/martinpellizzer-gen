    "intro": "Silene marschallii subsp. sahendica, commonly known as the Sahendic catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
