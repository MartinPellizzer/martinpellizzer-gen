    "intro": "Sideritis glacialis var. pulvinata, commonly known as the alpine sainfoin, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sideritis glacialis var. pulvinata is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
