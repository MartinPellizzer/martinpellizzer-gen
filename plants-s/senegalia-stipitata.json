    "intro": "Senegalia stipitata, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has compound leaves that are often reduced to small spines, a feature common in desert-adapted species. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Senegalia stipitata is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
