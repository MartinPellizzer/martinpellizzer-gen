    "intro": "Salix liangshuiensis var. subglabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a variant of the Liangshui willow native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in mountainous regions. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
