    "intro": "Scirpus inundatus, commonly known as the swamp bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features cylindrical, fibrous stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers at the top of its stem, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Scirpus inundatus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
