    "intro": "Specklinia attenuata, commonly known as the slender staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, narrow fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and good air circulation. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and terrarium gardening."
