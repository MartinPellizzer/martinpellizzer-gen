    "intro": "Sauvagesia imthurniana, commonly known as the Madagascar cypress, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by woody cones containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
