    "intro": "Stevia alternifolia, commonly known as the sweet leaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Stevia alternifolia is notable for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. It is widely used as a natural sweetener and has been cultivated for both commercial and traditional purposes."
