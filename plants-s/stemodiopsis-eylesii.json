    "intro": "Stemodiopsis eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' stemodia, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in the lower North Island and parts of the South Island, where it thrives in sunny, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
