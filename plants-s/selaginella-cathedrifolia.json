    "intro": "Selaginella cathedrifolia, commonly known as the cathedral fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like appearance with closely arranged, needle-like leaves that give it a lush, dense look. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and possess a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Selaginella cathedrifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
