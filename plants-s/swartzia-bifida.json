    "intro": "Swartzia bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf swartzia, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Swartzia bifida is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and potential medicinal properties. Its growth habit and unique foliage make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
