It features distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to water gardens. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. It thrives in shallow waters with moderate to high light exposure and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
