    "intro": "Selaginella atrivirens, commonly known as black thread moss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that are dark green to black in color. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella atrivirens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
