    "intro": "Saxifraga cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Saxifraga cuneata is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
