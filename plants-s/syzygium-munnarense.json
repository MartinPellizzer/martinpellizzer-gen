It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round, yellowish fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
