    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos unitus var. mucronatus, commonly known as the mucronate globular star, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a compact, rosette-like pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
