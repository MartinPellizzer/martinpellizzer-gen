    "intro": "Saccolabium rugosulum, commonly known as the roughleaf saccolabium, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
