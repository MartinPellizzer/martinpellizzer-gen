    "intro": "Selaginella engelmannii var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a species of spikemoss found in arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. This resilient species is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions."
