    "intro": "Scalesia gordilloi, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos giant daisy, is a striking plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower heads. The plant has a woody stem and produces numerous ray florets that give it a daisy-like appearance. Scalesia gordilloi is adapted to the unique volcanic soils and climate of the Gal\u00e1pagos, thriving in full sun. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for native pollinators and its contribution to the island's distinctive flora."
