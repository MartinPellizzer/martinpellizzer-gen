    "intro": "Smilax neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the island of New Caledonia. It features woody stems with sharp spines and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
