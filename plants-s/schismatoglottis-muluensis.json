    "intro": "Schismatoglottis muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu schismatoglottis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. This plant is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a prominent purple or brown lip. The plant is adapted to cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
