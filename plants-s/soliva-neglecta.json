    "intro": "Soliva neglecta, commonly known as little barley, is a low-growing annual grass that thrives in disturbed soils. It has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It is adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Soliva neglecta is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
