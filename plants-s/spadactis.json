    "intro": "Spadactis, commonly known as the sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian that belongs to the class Hexacorallia. It is characterized by its radial symmetry and a central column surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The tentacles are used for capturing prey and are equipped with specialized cells called cnidocytes. Spadactis typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and can be found attached to rocks or other substrates. Its simple yet efficient structure allows it to thrive in various marine environments."
