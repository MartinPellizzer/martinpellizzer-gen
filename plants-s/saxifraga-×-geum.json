    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 geum, commonly known as the garden saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga moschata. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils, making it a popular choice for gardeners. This plant is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
