    "intro": "Salix microtricha, commonly known as the slender willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of willow species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its growth is adapted to cold climates, with a short growing season and a tendency to produce new shoots from the base. Salix microtricha plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
