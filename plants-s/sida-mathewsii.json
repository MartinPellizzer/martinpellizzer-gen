    "intro": "Sida mathewsii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in harsh conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems. Sida mathewsii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
