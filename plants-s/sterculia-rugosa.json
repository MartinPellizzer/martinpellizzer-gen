    "intro": "Sterculia rugosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sterculia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical conditions. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
