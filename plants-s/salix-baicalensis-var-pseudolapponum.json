    "intro": "Salix baicalensis var. pseudolapponum, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in colder regions for landscaping purposes."
