    "intro": "Siphocampylus tuberculatus, commonly known as the mountain beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the tribe Polemonieae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Siphocampylus tuberculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
