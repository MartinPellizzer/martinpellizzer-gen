    "intro": "Sesleria elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Sesleria elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
