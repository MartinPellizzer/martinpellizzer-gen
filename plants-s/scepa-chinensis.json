    "intro": "Scepa chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Scepa chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
