    "intro": "Spiraea pilosa, commonly known as the rough spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features upright, multi-stemmed growth with finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Spiraea pilosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
