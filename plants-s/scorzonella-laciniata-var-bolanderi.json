    "intro": "Scorzonella laciniata var. bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often finely toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from the typical form of Scorzonella laciniata."
