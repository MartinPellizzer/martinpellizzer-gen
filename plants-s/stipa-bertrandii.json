    "intro": "Stipa bertrandii, commonly known as the Bertrand's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often pale green to brown in color. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight pubescence, and it blooms with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa bertrandii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying desert flora."
