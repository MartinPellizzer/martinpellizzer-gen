    "intro": "Sabatia lingulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandplain bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as pine woods and coastal dunes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive white or pale midrib, which helps in identification. Sabatia lingulata is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
