    "intro": "Scirpus liebmannianus, commonly known as the Liebmann's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Scirpus liebmannianus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
