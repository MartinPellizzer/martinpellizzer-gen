    "intro": "Silphium betonicifolium, commonly known as the eastern silphium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the betony plant. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Silphium betonicifolium is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its use in traditional herbal remedies. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
