    "intro": "Salvia radicans, commonly known as Mexican bush sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Salvia radicans is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
