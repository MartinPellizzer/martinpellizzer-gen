    "intro": "Salix lapponum var. daphneola, commonly known as the Lapland willow or dwarf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
