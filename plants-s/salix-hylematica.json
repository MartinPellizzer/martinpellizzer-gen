    "intro": "Salix hylematica, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Salix hylematica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful plant for riparian restoration projects."
