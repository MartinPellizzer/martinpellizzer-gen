    "intro": "Stomotechium, commonly known as the \"whisk fern,\" is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It lacks true leaves and roots, instead possessing simple, leaf-like structures called sporophylls. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are located at the base of the stem. Stomotechium thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution."
