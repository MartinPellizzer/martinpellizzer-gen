    "intro": "Stypandra glauca var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered stypandra, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as shrublands and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
