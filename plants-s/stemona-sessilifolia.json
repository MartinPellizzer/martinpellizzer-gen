    "intro": "Stemona sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf stemona, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem that is often branched and covered with a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a sessile (nearly stemless) base, giving it its common name. The plant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though its specific chemical composition remains under study."
