    "intro": "Stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often ribbed leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically appear in spring. The plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Stenophyllus species are generally herbaceous, with some varieties growing as annuals or perennials. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
