    "intro": "Sphaeralcea ambigua subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the variable catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well-adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss. The species is known for its variability in flower color and growth form, contributing to its common name."
