    "intro": "Salsola arbuscula var. hirta, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing shrub with a dense, cushion-like structure that helps it conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
