It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying vivid colors that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
