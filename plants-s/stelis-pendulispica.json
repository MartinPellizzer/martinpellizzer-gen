    "intro": "Stelis pendulispica, commonly known as the hanging spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, pendant inflorescence that bears small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light. Stelis pendulispica is often cultivated for its elegant appearance and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
