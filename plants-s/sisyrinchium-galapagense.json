It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the arid conditions of the islands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy blossoms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
