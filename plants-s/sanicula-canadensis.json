    "intro": "Sanicula canadensis, commonly known as Canadian snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are somewhat fibrous and have been used in traditional herbal medicine. Sanicula canadensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
