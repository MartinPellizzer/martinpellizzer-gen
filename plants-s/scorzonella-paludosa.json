    "intro": "Scorzonella paludosa, commonly known as marsh scorzonera, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils. Scorzonella paludosa is typically found in marshes, fens, and other moist environments where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its wetland ecosystems."
