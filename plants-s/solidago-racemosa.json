It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces abundant yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, elongated clusters called racemes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Solidago racemosa is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
