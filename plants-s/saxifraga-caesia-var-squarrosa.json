    "intro": "Saxifraga caesia var. squarrosa, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that are adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in alpine botany."
