    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 floribundum, commonly known as the flowering comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, violet or blue flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or garden settings. Due to its rapid growth and nutrient-rich biomass, it has been used historically in herbal medicine and soil enrichment."
