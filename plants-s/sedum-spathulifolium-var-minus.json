    "intro": "Sedum spathulifolium var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
