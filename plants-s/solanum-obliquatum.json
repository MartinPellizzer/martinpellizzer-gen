    "intro": "Solanum obliquatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, which bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is part of the nightshade family, which includes both edible and toxic species. Solanum obliquatum is generally considered non-invasive but can be mistaken for other nightshades due to its similar appearance."
