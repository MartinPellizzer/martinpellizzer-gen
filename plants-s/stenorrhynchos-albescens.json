    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically between November and March. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, humus-filled soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
