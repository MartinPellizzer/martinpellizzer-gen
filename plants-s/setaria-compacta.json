It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. Setaria compacta is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional practices for its medicinal properties."
