    "intro": "Sonchus vulgaris subsp. aquatilis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, often outcompeting native vegetation."
