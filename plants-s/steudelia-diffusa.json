    "intro": "Steudelia diffusa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its taproot system allows it to survive in dry conditions by storing water and nutrients. Steudelia diffusa is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats."
