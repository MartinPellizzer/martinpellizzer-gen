    "intro": "Saccharum alopecuroides subvar. trinii, commonly known as the Trinii canegrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often hidden among its foliage. While not widely cultivated for sugar production, it plays an ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
