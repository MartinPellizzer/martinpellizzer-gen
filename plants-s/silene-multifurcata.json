    "intro": "Silene multifurcata, commonly known as the forked catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are alternate and linear, with a distinctive hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss. Silene multifurcata is an herbaceous perennial, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators during its flowering period."
