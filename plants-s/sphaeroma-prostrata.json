    "intro": "Sphaeroma prostrata, commonly known as the flat sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Sphaeromatidae. It is characterized by its flattened, disc-shaped body covered in a fine, calcareous skeleton that forms a pattern resembling a sand dollar. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, particularly in sandy substrates, where it burrows through the sand to feed on organic matter. Its skeleton is composed of calcium carbonate and is often found eroded by wave action on beaches. Sphaeroma prostrata plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for various marine organisms."
