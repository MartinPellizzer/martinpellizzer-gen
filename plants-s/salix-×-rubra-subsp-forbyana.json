    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rubra subsp. forbyana, commonly known as the Forby willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its slender, often weeping growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces catkins, which are the primary means of pollen dispersal, and is often found in moist, riparian environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
