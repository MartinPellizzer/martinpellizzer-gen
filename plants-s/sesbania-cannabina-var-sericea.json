It is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
