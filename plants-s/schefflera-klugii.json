    "intro": "Schefflera klugii, commonly known as the Klug's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil. Schefflera klugii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
