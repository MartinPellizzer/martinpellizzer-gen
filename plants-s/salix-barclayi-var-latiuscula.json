It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its catkins are yellowish-green, and it produces small, woody fruits known as samaras. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
