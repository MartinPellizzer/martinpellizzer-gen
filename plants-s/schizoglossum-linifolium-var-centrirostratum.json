    "intro": "Schizoglossum linifolium var. centrirostratum, commonly known as the central-beaked rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
