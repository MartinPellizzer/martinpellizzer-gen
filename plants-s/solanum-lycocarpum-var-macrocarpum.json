It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant features hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries. The berries are edible but contain toxic compounds, making the plant both valuable and dangerous. It is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potential toxicity."
