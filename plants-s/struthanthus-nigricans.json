    "intro": "Struthanthus nigricans, commonly known as black-flowered struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking black petals and yellow stamens, which make it visually distinctive. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Loasaceae and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
