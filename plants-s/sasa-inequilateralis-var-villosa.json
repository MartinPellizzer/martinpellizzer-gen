    "intro": "Sasa inequilateralis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy bamboo, is a variant of the Sasa inequilateralis species native to East Asia. It is a clump-forming shrub characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by triangular, leathery seeds. Its leaves are elliptical, with a slightly rough texture and a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage and growth habit."
