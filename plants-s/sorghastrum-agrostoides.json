It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue-green in color. It is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it well adapted to arid environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
