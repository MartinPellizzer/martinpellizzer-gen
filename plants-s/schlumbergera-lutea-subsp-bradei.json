    "intro": "Schlumbergera lutea subsp. bradei, commonly known as the Orange Christmas Cactus, is a hybrid species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has thick, segmented stems that are adapted for storing water, typical of cacti. Its leaves are modified into flattened, fleshy structures that aid in photosynthesis. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
