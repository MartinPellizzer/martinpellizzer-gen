    "intro": "Strychnos viridescens, commonly known as the green-stemmed strychnos, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal. However, like many members of its genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
