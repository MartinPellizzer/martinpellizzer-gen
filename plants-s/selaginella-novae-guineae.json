It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Selaginella novae-guineae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
