    "intro": "Syngonanthus insularis, commonly known as the island pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Syngonanthus insularis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
