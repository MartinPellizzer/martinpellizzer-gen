    "intro": "Sagina apetala subsp. barbata, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences near the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
