    "intro": "Stapelia leendertziae, commonly known as the \"Cape Town Stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a distinctive scent reminiscent of decaying flesh. Its leaves are small and often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. Stapelia leendertziae is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
