    "intro": "Sphaeralcea rivularis var. diversa, commonly known as the riverbank globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and other riparian habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
