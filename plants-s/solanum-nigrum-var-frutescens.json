    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. frutescens, commonly known as black nightshade, is a shrub-like variant of the nightshade family. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which turn from yellow to black as they mature. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their unripe state. It is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
