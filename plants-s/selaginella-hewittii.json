This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Selaginella hewittii is adapted to drought conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience through its ability to survive desiccation. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in xerophytic plant communities."
