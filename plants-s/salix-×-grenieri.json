    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 grenieri, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its weeping, cascading branches that drape from the main trunk, creating a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces catkins as its primary flower structure, which are typically male and release pollen in the spring. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal visual appeal. Salix \u00d7 grenieri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water features or in wetland areas."
