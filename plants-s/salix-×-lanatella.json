    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 lanatella, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix matsudana and Salix babylonica, characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along water features."
