    "intro": "Skimmia melanocarpa, commonly known as black-fruited skimmia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that provide an elegant contrast to its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that remain on the branches through winter, adding visual interest. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Skimmia melanocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
