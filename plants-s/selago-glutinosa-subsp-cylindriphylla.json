    "intro": "Selago glutinosa subsp. cylindriphylla, commonly known as the cylindrical selago, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the cooler months. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
