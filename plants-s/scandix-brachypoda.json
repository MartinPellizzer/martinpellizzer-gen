    "intro": "Scandix brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed scurvy grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Scandix brachypoda is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
