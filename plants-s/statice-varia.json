    "intro": "Statice varia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for coastal ecology. Statice varia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
