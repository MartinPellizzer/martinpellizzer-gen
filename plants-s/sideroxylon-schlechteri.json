    "intro": "Sideroxylon schlechteri, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in dry, open woodlands and has compound leaves with a serrated margin. Its flowers are small and clustered, often green or yellowish, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
