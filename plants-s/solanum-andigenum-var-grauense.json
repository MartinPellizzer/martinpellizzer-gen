It is a perennial shrub characterized by its glandular hairy stems and leaves, which are often pubescent. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
