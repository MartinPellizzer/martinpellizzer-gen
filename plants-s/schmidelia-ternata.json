    "intro": "Schmidelia ternata, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often divided into three lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Schmidelia ternata is typically found in still or slow-moving water, where it can thrive in shallow, nutrient-rich environments."
