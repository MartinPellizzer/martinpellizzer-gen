    "intro": "Sarothamnus macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered thornbush, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in areas with full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sarothamnus macranthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
