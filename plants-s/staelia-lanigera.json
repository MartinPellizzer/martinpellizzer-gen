    "intro": "Staelia lanigera, commonly known as the woolly staelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in open, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Staelia lanigera is noted for its dense, woolly foliage that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions."
