    "intro": "Sapium submarginatum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive yellowish-green underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
