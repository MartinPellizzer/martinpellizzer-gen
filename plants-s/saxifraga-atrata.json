    "intro": "Saxifraga atrata, commonly known as the black saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, succulent leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga atrata plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and polar ecosystems."
