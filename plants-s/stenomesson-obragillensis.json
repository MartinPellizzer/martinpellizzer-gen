    "intro": "Stenomesson obragillensis, commonly known as the Obragill's stenomesson, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Stenomesson obragillensis is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss."
