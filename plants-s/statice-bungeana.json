    "intro": "Statice bungeana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color. Statice bungeana is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and drought-resistant nature."
