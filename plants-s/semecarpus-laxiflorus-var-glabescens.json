It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, spiky fruits that contain a single seed, which is used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The smooth, glabrous texture of its leaves distinguishes this variant from other members of the species."
