It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, twisting stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow and orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
