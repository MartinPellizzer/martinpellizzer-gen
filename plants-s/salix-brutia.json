    "intro": "Salix brutia, commonly known as the Syrian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Salix brutia has shallow roots, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in dry regions."
