    "intro": "Sempervivum caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun and cold climates. Sempervivum caucasicum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
