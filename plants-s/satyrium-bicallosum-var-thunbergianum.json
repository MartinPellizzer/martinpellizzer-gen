    "intro": "Satyrium bicallosum var. thunbergianum, commonly known as the Thunberg's lichen orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific montane habitats. It is characterized by its unique lichen-like appearance, with a dense, greenish-yellow pseudobulb that resembles lichen in texture and color. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green hue, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
