    "intro": "Senna sensitiva, commonly known as sensitive senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features feathery, bipinnate leaves that are sensitive to touch, a trait that gives it its common name. Its bright yellow flowers are typically clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senna sensitiva is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
