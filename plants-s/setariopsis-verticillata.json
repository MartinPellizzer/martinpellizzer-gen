    "intro": "Setariopsis verticillata, commonly known as the clustered spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
