    "intro": "Saxifraga ferruginea var. stellariformis, commonly known as the star-shaped saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, rusty-colored hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. This variant is distinguished by its more elaborate floral structure compared to other members of the Saxifraga genus."
