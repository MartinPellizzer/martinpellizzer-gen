    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara subvar. villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a weed in many regions."
