    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon subvar. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh weather conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Saxifraga aizoon subvar. alpicola is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
