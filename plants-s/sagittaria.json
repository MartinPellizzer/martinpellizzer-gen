    "intro": "Sagittaria, commonly known as arrowhead, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants found in wetlands, marshes, and shallow waters across the globe. These plants typically have arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or grow submerged, depending on the species. Sagittaria species are characterized by their distinctive floral structures, which often consist of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Additionally, some species are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions."
