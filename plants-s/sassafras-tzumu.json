    "intro": "Sassafras tzumu, commonly known as Chinese sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Sassafras tzumu thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
