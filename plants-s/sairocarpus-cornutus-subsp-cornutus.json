    "intro": "Sairocarpus cornutus subsp. cornutus, commonly known as the horned sairocarpus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched, and often spiky inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
