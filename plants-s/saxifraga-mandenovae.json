    "intro": "Saxifraga mandenovae, commonly known as the Mandenovae saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Saxifraga mandenovae is often found in open, sunny areas and is a characteristic species of mountain meadows."
