    "intro": "Spatholirion, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that often appear in shades of pink or white. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Spatholirion species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Spatholirion macrocarpum and Spatholirion nudum, which are native to parts of Africa and the Middle East."
