    "intro": "Schoenus paniculatus, commonly known as the swamp grass or panicled sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in other moist habitats, where it thrives in poorly drained soils. The plant features triangular stems with a distinct central vein, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy surface. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, branched cluster of small, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Schoenus paniculatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
