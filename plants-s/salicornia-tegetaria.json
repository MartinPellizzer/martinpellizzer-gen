    "intro": "Salicornia tegetaria, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in coastal and arid regions. The plant produces small, green or red flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it reproduces primarily through wind-pollinated flowers. Salicornia tegetaria is often found in salt marshes, estuaries, and along the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts."
