    "intro": "Semenovia dissectifolia, commonly known as the dissect-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dissected leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a short, terminal inflorescence. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
