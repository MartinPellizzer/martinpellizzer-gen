    "intro": "Sempervivum blandum, commonly known as the silver carpet or stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. Sempervivum blandum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including frost and poor soil, which contributes to its popularity among gardeners."
