    "intro": "Salix calostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, often forming dense stands. Salix calostachya is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
