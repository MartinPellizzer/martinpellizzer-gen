    "intro": "Scirpus squarrosus var. siamensis, commonly known as the Siam bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which appear at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it thrive in muddy or waterlogged soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland environments."
