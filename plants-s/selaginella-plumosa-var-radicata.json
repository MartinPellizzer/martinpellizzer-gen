    "intro": "Selaginella plumosa var. radicata, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. This variety is native to regions with moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate climates. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
