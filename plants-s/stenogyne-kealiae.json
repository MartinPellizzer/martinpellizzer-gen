    "intro": "Stenogyne kealiae, commonly known as Kealia false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within mesic forests, often near streams or in coastal regions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds upon maturity. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Stenogyne kealiae is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
