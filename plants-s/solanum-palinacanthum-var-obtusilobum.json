    "intro": "Solanum palinacanthum var. obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features hairy, egg-shaped leaves with broad, rounded lobes, and it produces small, violet-colored berries that contain toxic alkaloids. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by both livestock and humans."
