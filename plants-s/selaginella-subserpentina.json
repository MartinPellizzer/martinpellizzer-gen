    "intro": "Selaginella subserpentina, commonly known as the thread moss or slender spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella subserpentina is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its native habitats."
