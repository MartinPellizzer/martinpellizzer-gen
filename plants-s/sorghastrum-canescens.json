It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Sorghastrum canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
