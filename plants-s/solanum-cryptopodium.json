It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into bright red, elongated fruits, which are known for their extreme heat. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and the plant typically grows as an annual herb. The fruit contains a high concentration of capsaicin, making it one of the hottest chili peppers in the world."
