    "intro": "Sporobolus perrieri, commonly known as the desert sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies in sandy soils. Sporobolus perrieri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
