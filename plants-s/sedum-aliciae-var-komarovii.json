It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The leaves are thick and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
