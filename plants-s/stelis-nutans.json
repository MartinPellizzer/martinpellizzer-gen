    "intro": "Stelis nutans, commonly known as the drooping orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
