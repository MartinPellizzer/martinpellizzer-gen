It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, blooming from spring to early summer. Sagina boydii is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
