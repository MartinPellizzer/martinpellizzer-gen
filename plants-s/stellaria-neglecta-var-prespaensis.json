    "intro": "Stellaria neglecta var. prespaensis, commonly known as the Prespa starwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region. It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
