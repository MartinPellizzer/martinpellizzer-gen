    "intro": "Schaueriopsis, commonly known as the Schauer's orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plants typically produce showy, fragrant flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schaueriopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They require specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and well-draining soil, to thrive."
