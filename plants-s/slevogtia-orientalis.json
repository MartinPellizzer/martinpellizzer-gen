    "intro": "Slevogtia orientalis, commonly known as the eastern slevogtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
