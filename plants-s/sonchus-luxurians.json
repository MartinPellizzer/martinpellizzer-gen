    "intro": "Sonchus luxurians, commonly known as the showy sowthistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features lobed, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in some regions."
