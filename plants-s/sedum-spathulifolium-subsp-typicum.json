It is characterized by its fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread through offsets make it a hardy and low-maintenance plant."
