    "intro": "Soterosanthus, commonly known as the \"white soterosanthus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. Soterosanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
