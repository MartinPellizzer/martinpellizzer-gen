    "intro": "Silene astartes, commonly known as the common catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it produces distinctive, hairy seed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Silene astartes is known for its short growing season and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
