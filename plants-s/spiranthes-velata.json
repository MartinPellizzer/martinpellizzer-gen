    "intro": "Spiranthes velata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and cypress swamps, typically in the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
