    "intro": "Saussurea diamantiaca var. longifolia, commonly known as the longifoliate snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its robust, branched stems and large, showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
