    "intro": "Schleropelta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their hard, leathery fronds, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Schleropelta species are typically found in rocky or arid environments, where they form dense, low-growing mats. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. The genus is known for its ecological resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
