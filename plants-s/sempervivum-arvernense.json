    "intro": "Sempervivum arvernense, commonly known as the French stonecrop, is a low-growing, perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of France and Italy. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum arvernense is also known for its ability to survive in harsh climates, often remaining evergreen throughout the year."
