    "intro": "Salix rorida var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the slender willow, is a variant of the willow genus characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features a flexible, weeping stem that often produces catkins in early spring. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil along waterways."
