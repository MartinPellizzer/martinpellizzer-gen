    "intro": "Solanum giganteum var. longifolium, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a striking member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often preceding the development of its berries. Its foliage and berries contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. This variant is native to South America and is often cultivated for its ornamental value despite its toxic properties."
