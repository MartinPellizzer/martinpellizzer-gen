    "intro": "Senna suarezensis, commonly known as the yellow senna, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod fruits. The plant is known for its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it often grows in moist, tropical environments. Senna suarezensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
