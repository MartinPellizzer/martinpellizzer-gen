    "intro": "Schefflera longispicata, commonly known as the longispiculate umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically leathery, glossy, and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
