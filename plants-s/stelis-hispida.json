    "intro": "Stelis hispida, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. Stelis hispida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
