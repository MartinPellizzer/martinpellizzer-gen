    "intro": "Salix khokhriakovii, commonly known as the Afghan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
