    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salvia officinalus f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate sage, is a cultivar of the common sage plant. It is characterized by its distinctive bracts, which are modified leaves that often appear as small, fuzzy structures at the base of the flower clusters. This variety typically exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the standard Salvia officinalis. The leaves are gray-green in color and have a strong, aromatic scent. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can also be used in herbal teas and culinary applications."
