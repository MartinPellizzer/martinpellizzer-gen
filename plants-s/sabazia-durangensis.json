    "intro": "Sabazia durangensis, commonly known as the Durango sabazia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, adapting to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabazia durangensis is considered a vulnerable species."
