    "intro": "Scirpus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean region. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Scirpus domingensis is often found in shallow water or moist soil, contributing to the ecological stability of its environment. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps in preventing soil erosion."
