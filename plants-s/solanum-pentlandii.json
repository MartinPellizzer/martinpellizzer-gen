    "intro": "Solanum pentlandii, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces purple or blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution."
