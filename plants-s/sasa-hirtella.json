    "intro": "Sasa hirtella, commonly known as silvergrass or Japanese silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fluffy, silver-green inflorescences that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. Sasa hirtella is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic value and is also valued in traditional medicine."
