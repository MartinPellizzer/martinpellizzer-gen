    "intro": "Silene spinescens, commonly known as the spiny catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene spinescens is an annual plant, completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
