    "intro": "Striga phoenicea, commonly known as the desert witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of host plants, making it a significant agricultural pest in certain areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can severely impact crop yields in regions where it is prevalent."
