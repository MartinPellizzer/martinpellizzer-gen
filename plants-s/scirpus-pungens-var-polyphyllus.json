    "intro": "Scirpus pungens var. polyphyllus, commonly known as the purple stem bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that often display a striking purple hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. This species plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
