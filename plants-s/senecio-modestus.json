    "intro": "Senecio modestus, commonly known as the dwarf African daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
