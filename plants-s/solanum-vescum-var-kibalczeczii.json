    "intro": "Solanum vescum var. kibalczeczii, commonly known as the Kibalczeczii nightshade, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption and is more valued in ecological studies."
