    "intro": "Salix depressa var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams, wetlands, and riparian zones. Its flowers are catkins, which are usually pollinated by wind, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
