    "intro": "Salix microphyta var. rivulicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the wetlands and stream banks of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
