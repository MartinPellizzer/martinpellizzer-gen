    "intro": "Sclerostylis roxburghii, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy red or orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and has a compact, upright growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Sclerostylis roxburghii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
