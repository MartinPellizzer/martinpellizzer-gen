    "intro": "Satyrium humile, commonly known as the small purple orchid, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale purple or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a slender, upright stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are often clustered at the top of the stem and are pollinated by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
