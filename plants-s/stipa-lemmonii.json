    "intro": "Stipa lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grasslands. Its flowering stalks produce dense clusters of small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often pinkish or purplish in hue. Stipa lemmonii plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
