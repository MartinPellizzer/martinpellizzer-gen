    "intro": "Salix cordata var. desolata, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, woody capsules containing the seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife in desert ecosystems."
