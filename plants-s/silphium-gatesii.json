    "intro": "Silphium gatesii, commonly known as the eastern silphium, is a now-extinct plant native to the eastern United States. It was a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and was characterized by its tall, branching stems and yellow flowers. The plant was historically valued for its medicinal properties, particularly its latex, which was used in ancient times as a contraceptive and for treating wounds. Silphium gatesii was also an important crop in pre-Columbian times, cultivated for its seeds and oil. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it became extinct by the 17th century."
