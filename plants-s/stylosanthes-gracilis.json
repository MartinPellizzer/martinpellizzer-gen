    "intro": "Stylosanthes gracilis, commonly known as slender stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. Stylosanthes gracilis is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in forage and soil conservation systems. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
