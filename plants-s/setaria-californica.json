    "intro": "Setaria californica, commonly known as California foxtail, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear bristly, awned spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture. Setaria californica is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions."
