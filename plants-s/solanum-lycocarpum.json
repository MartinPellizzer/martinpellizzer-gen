    "intro": "Solanum lycocarpum, commonly known as the ara\u00e7\u00e1-preto or black ara\u00e7\u00e1, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible when ripe, though they contain toxic compounds in their raw form. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. Solanum lycocarpum is valued both for its ornamental qualities and for traditional uses in local communities."
