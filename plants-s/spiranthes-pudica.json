    "intro": "Spiranthes pudica, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its most distinctive feature: its spiral-shaped flower spikes, which give it its common name. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color and bloom in late summer to early autumn. This orchid thrives in moist, shady habitats such as wetlands and forest understories. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty."
