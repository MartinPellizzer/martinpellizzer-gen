    "intro": "Stapelia revoluta var. glaucescens, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically pale green or bluish in color, often with a strong odor resembling decay. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the cooler months. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
