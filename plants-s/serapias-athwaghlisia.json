    "intro": "Serapias athwaghlisia, commonly known as the Cretan marsh orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats, thriving in areas with high humidity and poor soil conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serapias athwaghlisia is considered a vulnerable species."
