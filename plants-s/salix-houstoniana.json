    "intro": "Salix houstoniana, commonly known as Houstonia willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
