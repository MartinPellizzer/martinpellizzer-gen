    "intro": "Saxifraga richardsonii, commonly known as Richardson's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga richardsonii is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
