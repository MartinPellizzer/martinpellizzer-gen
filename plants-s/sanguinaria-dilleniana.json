    "intro": "Sanguinaria dilleniana, commonly known as the Dillen's bloodroot, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a fleshy, rhizomatous root system that stores nutrients and allows it to survive harsh winters. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a basal sheath and a cluster of bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a waxy texture and a deep green color. The plant is noted for its toxic sap, which contains alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine."
