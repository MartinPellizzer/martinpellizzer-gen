    "intro": "Salicornia pulvinata, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, aiding survival in arid coastal regions. The plant produces small, green or red flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are scale-like and often reduced, while the stems are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Salicornia pulvinata is found in salt marshes, mudflats, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
