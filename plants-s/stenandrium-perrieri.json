    "intro": "Stenandrium perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's stenandrium, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly threatened and requires urgent conservation efforts."
