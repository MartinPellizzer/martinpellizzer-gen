It typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a distinctive long, trailing tail-like structure at the tip. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose raceme. Stelis caudata thrives in high humidity and requires well-draining, loose potting media for optimal growth."
