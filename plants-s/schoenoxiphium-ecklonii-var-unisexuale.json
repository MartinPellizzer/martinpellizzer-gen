    "intro": "Schoenoxiphium ecklonii var. unisexuale, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its unisexual flowers, with separate male and female flowers on different plants."
