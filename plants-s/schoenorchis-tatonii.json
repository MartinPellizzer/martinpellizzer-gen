    "intro": "[WRONG START] Schoen Orchis tatonii, commonly known as the Taton's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to specific regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pale green or white in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
