    "intro": "Stylogyne turbacensis, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette. Stylogyne turbacensis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
