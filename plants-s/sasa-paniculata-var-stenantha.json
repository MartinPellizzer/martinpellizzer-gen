    "intro": "Sasa paniculata var. stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bamboo, is a clump-forming evergreen bamboo native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright culms that are typically smooth and green, with a tendency to develop a reddish hue as they mature. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in both horticultural and traditional settings."
