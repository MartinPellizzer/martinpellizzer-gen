It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems. Sinarundinaria arunachalensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
