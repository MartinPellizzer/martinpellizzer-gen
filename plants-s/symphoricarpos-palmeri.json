    "intro": "Symphoricarpos palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's snowberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, providing year-round structure. The berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals, contributing to the ecological balance of its native range."
