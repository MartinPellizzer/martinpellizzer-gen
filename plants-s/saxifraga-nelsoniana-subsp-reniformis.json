    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana subsp. reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of oval, waxy leaves that are typically kidney-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
