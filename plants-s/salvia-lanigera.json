    "intro": "Salvia lanigera, commonly known as wooly sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Salvia lanigera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
