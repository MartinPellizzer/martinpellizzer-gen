    "intro": "Swainsona ecallosa, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It has adapted to survive in dry environments through deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility. Swainsona ecallosa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
