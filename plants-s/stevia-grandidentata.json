It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. Stevia grandidentata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
