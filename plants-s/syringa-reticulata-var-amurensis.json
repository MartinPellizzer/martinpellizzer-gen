    "intro": "Syringa reticulata var. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of white to pink. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
