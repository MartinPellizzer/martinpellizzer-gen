    "intro": "Sida petiolaris, commonly known as seaside cotton or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in saline or brackish environments. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Sida petiolaris is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it a resilient coastal plant."
