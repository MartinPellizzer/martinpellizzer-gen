    "intro": "Saxifraga virginiensis var. californica, commonly known as the California saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in dry, sunny environments such as cliffs and slopes. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of stems during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
