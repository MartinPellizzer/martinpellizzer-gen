    "intro": "Schollera europaea, commonly known as the European schollera, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Schollera europaea is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind."
