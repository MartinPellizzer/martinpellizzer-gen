It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink or white flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
