    "intro": "Solenanthus amplifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
