    "intro": "Salix anglorum var. kophophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, riverbanks, and wet woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
