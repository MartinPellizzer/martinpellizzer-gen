    "intro": "Shawia avicenniifolia, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, pinnately compound leaves that are adapted to thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Shawia avicenniifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity. Its unique morphology reflects its adaptation to harsh, wetland habitats."
