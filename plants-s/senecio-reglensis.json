    "intro": "Senecio reglensis, commonly known as the Reglens ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
