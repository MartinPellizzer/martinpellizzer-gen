    "intro": "Salix lasiandra subsp. caudata, commonly known as the long-haired willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
