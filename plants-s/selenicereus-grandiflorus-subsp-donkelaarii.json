    "intro": "Selenicereus grandiflorus subsp. donkelaarii, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a tropical climbing cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The plant is often cultivated for its striking floral display and is adapted to arid environments."
