    "intro": "Satyrium goetzenianum, commonly known as the Goetzenian moonflower, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its unique morphology includes long, slender petals and a specialized lip that aids in pollination. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
