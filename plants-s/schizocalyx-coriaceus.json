    "intro": "Schizocalyx coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Schizocalyx coriaceus thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
