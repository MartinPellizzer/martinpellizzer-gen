    "intro": "Salicornia praecox var. longispicata, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in coastal botany."
