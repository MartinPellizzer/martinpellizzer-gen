It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
