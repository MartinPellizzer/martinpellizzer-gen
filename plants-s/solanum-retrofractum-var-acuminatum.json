    "intro": "Solanum retrofractum var. acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, characterized by its toxic alkaloids and showy flowers. It is a perennial shrub native to certain regions of South America, typically found in humid, tropical environments. The plant features ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a globose berry that turns red when mature, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
