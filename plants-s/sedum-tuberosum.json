    "intro": "Sedum tuberosum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It blooms in summer and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness. Sedum tuberosum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
