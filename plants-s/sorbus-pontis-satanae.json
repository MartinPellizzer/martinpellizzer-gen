    "intro": "Sorbus pontis-satanae, commonly known as the Pontic mountain ash, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus pontis-satanae is considered a vulnerable species."
