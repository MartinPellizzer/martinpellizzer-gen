    "intro": "Schiedeella parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host trees, primarily in the Eucalyptus genus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Schiedeella parasitica is native to Australia and is often found in dry, forested areas. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it a significant ecological concern in certain ecosystems."
