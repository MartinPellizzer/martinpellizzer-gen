    "intro": "[WRONG START] Saxifraga linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, adding to its ornamental appeal. Saxifraga linearifolia is valued in horticulture for its ability to add texture and color to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
