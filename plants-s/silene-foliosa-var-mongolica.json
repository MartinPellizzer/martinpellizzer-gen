It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems that bear small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat. Silene foliosa var. mongolica is often found in open grasslands and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
