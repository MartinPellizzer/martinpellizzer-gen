    "intro": "Schizoglossum pachyglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbed stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Schizoglossum pachyglossum thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
