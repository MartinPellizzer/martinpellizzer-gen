    "intro": "Sesleria comosa var. weberi, commonly known as the woolly feather grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features fine, silver-gray foliage with a dense, tufted appearance, and its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of pale green to golden flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
