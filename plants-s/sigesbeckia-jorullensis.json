    "intro": "Sigesbeckia jorullensis, commonly known as the Jorullensis bladdernut, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Sigesbeckia jorullensis is typically found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
