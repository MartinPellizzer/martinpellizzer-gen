    "intro": "Solanum appressum, commonly known as the purple nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for consumption or cultivation in gardens."
