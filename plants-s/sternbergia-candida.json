    "intro": "Sternbergia candida, commonly known as the winter aconite, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a bulbous perennial that produces bright yellow flowers in late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold climates, often blooming through snow. Its flowers are typically borne on short, hairy stems and are attractive to early pollinators. Sternbergia candida is valued in horticulture for its early bloom and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
