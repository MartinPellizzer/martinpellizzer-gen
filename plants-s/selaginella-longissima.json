    "intro": "Selaginella longissima, commonly known as the stair-step spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant features elongated, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, cone-like formations. Selaginella longissima is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its unique adaptations."
