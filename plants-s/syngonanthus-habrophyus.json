    "intro": "Syngonanthus habrophyus, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems that are often reddish in color, which provide structural support and help it withstand coastal winds and salt spray. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Syngonanthus habrophyus is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used by local communities for various purposes."
