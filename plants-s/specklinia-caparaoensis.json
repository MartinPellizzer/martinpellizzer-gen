    "intro": "Specklinia caparaoensis, commonly known as the Capara\u00f3 fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, intricate vein pattern. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its small, spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its leaves, facilitating reproduction in its natural habitat. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
