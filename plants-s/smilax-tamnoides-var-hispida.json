    "intro": "Smilax tamnoides var. hispida, commonly known as the rough smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, spiny bracts and its compound leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its hirsute appearance and aggressive growth habit make it both a notable and sometimes problematic plant in its native habitat."
