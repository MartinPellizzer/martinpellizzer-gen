    "intro": "Solanum homalospermum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, contain alkaloids and are used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, drought conditions."
