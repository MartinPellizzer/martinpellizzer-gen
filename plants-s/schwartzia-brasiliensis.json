    "intro": "Schwartzia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and it plays an important role in the ecosystems of the Atlantic Forest. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species."
