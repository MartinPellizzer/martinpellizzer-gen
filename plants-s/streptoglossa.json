    "intro": "Streptoglossa, commonly known as the star-shaped or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, dandelion-like flowers that often have a distinctive star-shaped appearance. Streptoglossa species are typically annual or perennial herbs with alternate, usually lance-shaped leaves. They are native to various regions in Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The flowers produce small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal."
