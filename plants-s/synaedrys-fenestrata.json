It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are notable for their distinctive fenestrations, or leaf holes, which give the plant its common name.
