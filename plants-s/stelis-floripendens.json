It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that often hang downward. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in loose soil or moss. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects."
