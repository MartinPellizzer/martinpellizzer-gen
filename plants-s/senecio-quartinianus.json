It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
