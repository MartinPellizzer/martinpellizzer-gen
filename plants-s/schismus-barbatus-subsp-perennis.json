    "intro": "Schismus barbatus subsp. perennis, commonly known as the desert carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in desert environments."
