    "intro": "Selliguea hastata var. hastata, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It features a creeping rhizome system with dense, clustered fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with small, ovate to elliptic pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns, and is well adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. This variety is native to southern Africa and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline."
