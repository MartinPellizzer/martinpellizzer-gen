    "intro": "Sarcinula psichion, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small stars, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in photosynthesis. Sarcinula psichion is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
