    "intro": "Senna quinquangulata var. meizonoloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved senna, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are broader and more rounded compared to the typical senna species. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits and are adapted for dispersal by animals. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine."
