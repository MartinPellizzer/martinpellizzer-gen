It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
