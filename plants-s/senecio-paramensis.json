It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers are yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio paramensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic features."
