    "intro": "Succisa pratensis var. arenaria, commonly known as sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy and coastal habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in environments with full sun. It is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and other sandy areas. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
