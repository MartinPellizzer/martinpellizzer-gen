    "intro": "Solanum quitoense f. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern Ecuadorian nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Solanum quitoense species. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador, specifically in the high-altitude areas of the northern part of the country. This plant is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and hairy, glandular leaves, which are typical features of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
