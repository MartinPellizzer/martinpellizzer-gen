    "intro": "Schaffnera, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. Schaffnera species typically have a short, thick stem with a single, large, showy inflorescence. These plants are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in humid, warm environments."
