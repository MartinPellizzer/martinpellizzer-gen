    "intro": "Sphenopholis palustris subsp. flexuosa, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its inflorescence consists of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Sphenopholis palustris subsp. flexuosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
