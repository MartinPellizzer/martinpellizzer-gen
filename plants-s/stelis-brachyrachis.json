    "intro": "Stelis brachyrachis, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with few leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
