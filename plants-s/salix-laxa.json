    "intro": "Salix laxa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species is often found near water sources and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
