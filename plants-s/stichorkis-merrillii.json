    "intro": "Stichorkis merrillii, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its reproductive strategy involves a specialized relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Stichorkis merrillii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
