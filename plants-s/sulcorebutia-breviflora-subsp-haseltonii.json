    "intro": "Sulcorebutia breviflora subsp. haseltonii, commonly known as the Haselton's sun rose, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem with a ribbed structure and produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with succulent stems that store water efficiently. Its foliage is typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
