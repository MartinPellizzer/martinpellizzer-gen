    "intro": "Saussurea villosa, commonly known as the woolly saussurea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Saussurea villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
