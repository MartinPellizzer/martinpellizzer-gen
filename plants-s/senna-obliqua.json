    "intro": "Senna obliqua, commonly known as the candle bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils. Senna obliqua is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
