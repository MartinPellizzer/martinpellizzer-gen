    "intro": "Squamellaria kajewskii, commonly known as the Kajewskii's squamellaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Brazil and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, leaf-like structures called squamellaria, which are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It has a short, woody stem and is typically found growing as an epiphyte on trees. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
