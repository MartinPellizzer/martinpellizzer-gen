It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida mysorensis is often found in moist, open habitats such as fields and along riverbanks."
