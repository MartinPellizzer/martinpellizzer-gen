    "intro": "Specklinia anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes speckled fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often speckled with small, dark spots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates like moss or soil. Specklinia anderssonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
