    "intro": "Sagittaria graminea var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water, pond margins, and wetlands, often forming dense mats. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged, with long, slender stems. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in umbels, and it produces distinctive, boat-shaped fruits. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
