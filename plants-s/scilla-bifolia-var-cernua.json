    "intro": "Scilla bifolia var. cernua, commonly known as the nodding scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that hang downward. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to woodland gardens. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant, nodding flowers and its ability to naturalize over time."
