    "intro": "Sorghum australiense, commonly known as the Australian millet, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Sorghum australiense is often used for forage and has potential agricultural applications in drought-prone regions."
