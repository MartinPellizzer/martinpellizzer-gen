    "intro": "Selaginella laevigata, commonly known as the smooth spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a vascular plant with a distinctive rosette-like structure composed of closely packed, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and reproductive features make it an important species in the study of early land plant evolution."
