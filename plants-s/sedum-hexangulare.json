It is characterized by its fleshy, six-sided stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions.
