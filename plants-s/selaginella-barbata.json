    "intro": "Selaginella barbata, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with upright, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Selaginella barbata is characterized by its ability to produce sporophytes, which develop from spores released by the gametophyte stage. This species is also notable for its resilience and ability to survive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
