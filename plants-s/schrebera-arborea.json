    "intro": "Schrebera arborea, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
