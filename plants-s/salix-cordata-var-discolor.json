    "intro": "Salix cordata var. discolor, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grayish-barked stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) base. This species is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows."
