    "intro": "Selinum dimidiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved angel's wing, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
