    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 oligotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, often riparian environments. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and improve soil quality."
