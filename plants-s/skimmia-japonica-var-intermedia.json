    "intro": "Skimmia japonica var. intermedia, commonly known as Japanese skimmia or intermediate skimmia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring. The plant is characterized by its slow growth and dense, compact form, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, and its berries, which turn red in autumn, are ornamental but not edible. Skimmia japonica var. intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden environments."
