    "intro": "Salvia dinteri, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its unique, elongated flower spikes that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salvia dinteri is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
