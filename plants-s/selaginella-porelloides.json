    "intro": "Selaginella porelloides, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures that contain spores. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Selaginella porelloides exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species in arid conditions. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, which is a key feature of its life cycle."
