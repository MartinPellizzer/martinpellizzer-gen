    "intro": "Synechanthus ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian synechanthus, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its native habitat. Its floral structure is notable for its vibrant colors and nectar-rich petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
