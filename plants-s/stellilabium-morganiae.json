    "intro": "Stellilabium morganiae, commonly known as the Morgan's star-labium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped petals that are often a vibrant mix of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
