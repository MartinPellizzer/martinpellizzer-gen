    "intro": "Sorbus cashmiriana f. thomsonii, commonly known as the Kashmir whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool and moist environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a finely serrated margin. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in the Himalayas."
