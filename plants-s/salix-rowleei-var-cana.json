    "intro": "Salix rowleei var. cana, commonly known as the white willow or silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers arranged separately on the same inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
