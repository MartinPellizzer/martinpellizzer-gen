    "intro": "Sempervivum murithii, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, upright leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and well-draining conditions. Sempervivum murithii is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
