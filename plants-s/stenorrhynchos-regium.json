    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos regium, commonly known as the royal stenorrhynchos, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a deep purple or violet hue with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the old ones, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, providing a lush, green backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized collections and botanical gardens."
