    "intro": "Stipa tianschanica, commonly known as the Tian Shan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spiky inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Stipa tianschanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
