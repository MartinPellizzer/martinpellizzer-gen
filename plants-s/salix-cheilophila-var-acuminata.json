    "intro": "Salix cheilophila var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
