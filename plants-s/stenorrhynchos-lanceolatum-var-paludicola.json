    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos lanceolatum var. paludicola, commonly known as the swampy lanceleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and swamps. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, supporting various aquatic life forms."
