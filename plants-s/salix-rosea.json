    "intro": "Salix rosea, commonly known as the pink willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Salix rosea is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
