    "intro": "Staavia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions, which cover its stems and leaves, giving it its common name. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Staavia glutinosa is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
