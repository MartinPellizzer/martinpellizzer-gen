    "intro": "Solanum hasslerianum f. quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, lobed, oak-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
