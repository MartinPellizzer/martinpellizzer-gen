    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. oppositifolia, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
