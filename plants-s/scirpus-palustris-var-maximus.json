    "intro": "Scirpus palustris var. maximus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. This species plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
