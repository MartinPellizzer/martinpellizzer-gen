    "intro": "Scirpus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Scirpus pumilus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
