    "intro": "Saxifraga hitchcockiana, commonly known as the Hitchcock's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically pink or white, appearing in late summer. Saxifraga hitchcockiana is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
