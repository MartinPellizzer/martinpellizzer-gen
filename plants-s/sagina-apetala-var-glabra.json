    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. glabra, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate harsh conditions, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
