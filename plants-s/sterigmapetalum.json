    "intro": "Sterigmapetalum, commonly known as the \"butterfly flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy, petal-like bracts that resemble butterfly wings, which are often mistaken for actual petals. The plant typically has small, inconspicuous true flowers surrounded by these colorful, modified leaves. Sterigmapetalum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm climates."
