    "intro": "Silene vulgaris subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its pink or purple flowers and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has hairy, erect stems. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
