    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 heteromera, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix schwerinii (a species from Central Asia). The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of wind pollination. Salix \u00d7 heteromera is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
