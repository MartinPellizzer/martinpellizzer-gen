    "intro": "Schefflera rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Schefflera rugosa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its lush foliage. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
