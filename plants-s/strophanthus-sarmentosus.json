    "intro": "Strophanthus sarmentosus, commonly known as the red devil's backbone, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, orange fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, yellow aril. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs. Strophanthus sarmentosus is notable for containing toxic cardiac glycosides, which have historically been used in traditional medicine and as poisons."
