    "intro": "Sporobolus kerrii, commonly known as Kerri's sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, which aids in its colonization of sandy and disturbed soils. Sporobolus kerrii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
