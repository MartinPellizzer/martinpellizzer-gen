    "intro": "Sporobolus arkansanus, commonly known as Arkansas dropseed, is a native grass species found primarily in the central and southeastern United States. It is a warm-season grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is drought-tolerant and has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various soil conditions. Arkansas dropseed is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
