    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia subsp. stevenii, commonly known as the Steven's willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing stream banks."
