    "intro": "Stevia lasioclada, commonly known as the woolly stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Stevia lasioclada is valued for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain natural sweeteners called steviol glycosides. It is often used as a sugar substitute in food and beverages due to its intense sweetness and low caloric content."
