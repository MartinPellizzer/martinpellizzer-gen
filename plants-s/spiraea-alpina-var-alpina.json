    "intro": "Spiraea alpina var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most notable characteristic is its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
