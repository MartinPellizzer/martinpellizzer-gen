    "intro": "Sedum aizoon f. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. It is native to arid and rocky environments, particularly in regions of North America. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing ornamental value in both summer and winter."
