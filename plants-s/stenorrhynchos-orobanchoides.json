    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos orobanchoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Indian pipe, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are often clustered at the base of its leafless stems. Its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an interesting subject in botanical studies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
