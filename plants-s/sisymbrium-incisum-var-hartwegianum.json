    "intro": "Sisymbrium incisum var. hartwegianum, commonly known as Hart's cutleaf mustard, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely cut, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
