    "intro": "Salix wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
