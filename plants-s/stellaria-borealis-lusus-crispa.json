    "intro": "Stellaria borealis lusus crispa, commonly known as the Arctic starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
