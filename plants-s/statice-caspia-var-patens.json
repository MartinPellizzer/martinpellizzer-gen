    "intro": "Statice caspia var. patens, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy or coastal soils, making it an important plant in dune ecosystems. Statice caspia var. patens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
