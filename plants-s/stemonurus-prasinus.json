    "intro": "Stemonurus prasinus, commonly known as the green moss plant, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a dense, carpet-like growth form with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature. Stemonurus prasinus plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
