    "intro": "Sphenogyne scapiformis, commonly known as the scapiform sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique, scapiform (strap-like) floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sphenogyne scapiformis is considered a vulnerable species."
