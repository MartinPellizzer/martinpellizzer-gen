    "intro": "Stenandrium talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's stenandrium, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees, and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements."
