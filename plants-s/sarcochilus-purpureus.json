    "intro": "Sarcochilus purpureus, commonly known as the purple hinged lip, is an epiphytic orchid native to New Zealand. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive hinged lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Sarcochilus genus. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded outdoor areas."
