    "intro": "Squamaria orobanche, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
