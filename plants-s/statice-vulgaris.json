    "intro": "Statice vulgaris, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spike-like flower heads composed of numerous small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically gray-green in color, and the plant is drought-tolerant. Statice vulgaris is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
