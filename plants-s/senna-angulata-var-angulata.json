    "intro": "Senna angulata var. angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are narrow and have a distinctive angular appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its potential as a forage crop."
