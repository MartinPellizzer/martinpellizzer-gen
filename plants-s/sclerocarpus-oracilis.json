    "intro": "Sclerocarpus oracilis, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, woody fruits that remain on the plant for extended periods, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by animals. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female plants, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. The botanical structure of Sclerocarpus oracilis reflects its adaptation to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
