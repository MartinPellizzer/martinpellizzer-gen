    "intro": "Schizolaena masoalensis, commonly known as the Masoalensis Schizolaena, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Schizolaena masoalensis is adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat and is typically found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
