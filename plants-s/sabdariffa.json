    "intro": "Sabdariffa, commonly known as roselle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive calyces, which are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The calyces are harvested and used to make tea, jams, and sauces due to their tart flavor and high vitamin C content. Sabdariffa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
