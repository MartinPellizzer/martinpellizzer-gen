    "intro": "Selaginella wahauensis, commonly known as the New Zealand clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, which is a feature of some primitive vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
