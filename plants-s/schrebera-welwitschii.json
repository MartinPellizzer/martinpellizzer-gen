    "intro": "Schrebera welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its trunk and having a slow growth rate. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Schrebera welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
