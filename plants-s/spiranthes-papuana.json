    "intro": "Spiranthes papuana, commonly known as the Papuan spiral orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to New Guinea. It is a terrestrial herb with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces intricate, spiral-shaped inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
