    "intro": "Stenospermation pteropus, commonly known as the narrow-seed fern, is a fossil plant that lived during the Carboniferous period. It is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branched stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant's reproductive structures suggest it was a primitive seed plant, possibly related to the ancestors of modern gymnosperms. Its fossils are often found in coal-bearing strata, indicating it thrived in swampy, tropical environments. The study of Stenospermation pteropus provides insights into early plant evolution and the development of seed plants."
