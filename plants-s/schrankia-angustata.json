    "intro": "Schrankia angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf schrankia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated margin. Schrankia angustata produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the early summer months. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings."
