    "intro": "Salix glandulosa var. warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg willow, is a shrub native to the arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, elliptical leaves with a glandular underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in cold climates."
