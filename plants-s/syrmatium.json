    "intro": "Syrmatium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish pubescence. Syrmatium species produce small, often yellow or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruits are berries that can be toxic, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family."
