    "intro": "Selaginella laxifolia, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of its spore-producing life cycle. Selaginella laxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
