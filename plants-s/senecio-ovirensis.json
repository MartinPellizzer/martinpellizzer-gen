    "intro": "Senecio ovirensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. This succulent plant has adapted to extreme aridity with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
