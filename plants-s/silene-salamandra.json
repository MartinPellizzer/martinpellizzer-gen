    "intro": "Silene salamandra, commonly known as the dragon's blood plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene salamandra is also notable for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in treating wounds and inflammation."
