    "intro": "Spathiger roigii, commonly known as the Roig's spathiger, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated spathaceous bract that encloses the inflorescence. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that includes both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spathiger roigii is considered a species of conservation concern."
