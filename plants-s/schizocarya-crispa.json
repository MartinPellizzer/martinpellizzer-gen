It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, green, succulent leaves with serrated edges, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. Schizocarya crispa is often found in rocky soils and alpine regions, where it thrives in full sun."
