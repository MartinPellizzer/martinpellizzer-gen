    "intro": "Simaba glabra, commonly known as white cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and fragrant, yellowish wood. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
