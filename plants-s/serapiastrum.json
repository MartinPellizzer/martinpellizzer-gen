    "intro": "Serapiastrum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically silver or gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the branches. Serapiastrum species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as shade trees or in ornamental gardens."
