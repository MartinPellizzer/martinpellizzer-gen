    "intro": "Salix cardiobasis, commonly known as the heartleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate to elliptic leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The leaves are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing seasonal visual interest."
