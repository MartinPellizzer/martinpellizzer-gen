    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 liegnitzensis, commonly known as the Weeping Willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. The plant produces catkins as its primary flower structure, which are typically male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, fluffy seeds. Its leaves are elongated, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal beauty. It thrives in moist soils and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
