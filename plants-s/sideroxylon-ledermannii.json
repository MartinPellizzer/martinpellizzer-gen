It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its durability, the wood is highly valued for construction and furniture-making."
