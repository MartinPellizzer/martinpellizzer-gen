It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Sida kunthiana is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
