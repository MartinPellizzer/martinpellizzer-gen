    "intro": "Silene hifacensis var. hifacensis, commonly known as the Hifacensis catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hifafa in the South Pacific. It is a low-growing herb with hairy stems and fleshy, blue to purple-pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
