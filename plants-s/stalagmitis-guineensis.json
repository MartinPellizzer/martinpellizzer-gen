    "intro": "Stalagmitis guineensis, commonly known as the West African climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of West Africa. It is a climbing fern that typically grows along tree trunks and branches, using its aerial roots for support. The plant has large, broad, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in spikes, and it produces spores rather than seeds for reproduction. Stalagmitis guineensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforest canopies."
