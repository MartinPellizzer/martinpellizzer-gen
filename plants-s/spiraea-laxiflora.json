    "intro": "Spiraea laxiflora, commonly known as the willowleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, willow-like leaves that are lance-shaped and have a soft, silvery-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
