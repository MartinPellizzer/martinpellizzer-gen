    "intro": "Secale cereale subsp. segetale, commonly known as rye grass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Rye grass is often used in forage, erosion control, and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
