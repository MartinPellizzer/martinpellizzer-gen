    "intro": "Schismatoglottis antu, commonly known as the Antu banana, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its mountainous habitat. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, Schismatoglottis antu is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
