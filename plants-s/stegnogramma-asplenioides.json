    "intro": "Stegnogramma asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate. Stegnogramma asplenioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
