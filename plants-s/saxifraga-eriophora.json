    "intro": "Saxifraga eriophora, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, cushion-like mats and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are pollinated by insects. Saxifraga eriophora is often found growing on rocky slopes and in open, well-drained soils."
