    "intro": "Salix qinlingica, commonly known as Qinling willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Qinling Mountains in central China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along streams or in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species with ecological significance in its native habitat."
