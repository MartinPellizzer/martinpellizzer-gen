    "intro": "Schinus lentiscifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
