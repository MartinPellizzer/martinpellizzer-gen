    "intro": "Stipa littorea, commonly known as sea grass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, often in salt-affected environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand wind and salt spray. Stipa littorea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
