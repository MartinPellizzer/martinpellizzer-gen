    "intro": "Salix lindleyana f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and weeping branches, which give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. Its flowering catkins appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
