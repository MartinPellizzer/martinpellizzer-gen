    "intro": "Solanum scopulorum, commonly known as the rock nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in the spring. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. While it is part of the nightshade family, it is not typically cultivated for its edible qualities due to the presence of toxic compounds in its leaves and berries."
