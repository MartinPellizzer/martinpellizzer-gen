It is native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean, Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Suaeda erecta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
