    "intro": "Stelis velutina, commonly known as the velvet stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for support rather than nutrients. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. Stelis velutina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
