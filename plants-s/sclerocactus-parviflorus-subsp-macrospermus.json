    "intro": "Sclerocactus parviflorus subsp. macrospermus, commonly known as the giant desert cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, ribbed stems that can grow up to several feet in height, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its thick, spiny stems are covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss and protects against intense sunlight. This subspecies is notable for its size and resilience, making it a striking feature of desert landscapes."
