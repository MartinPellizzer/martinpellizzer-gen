It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences, which are typically found at the top of the stems. This variety is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
