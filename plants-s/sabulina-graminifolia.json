    "intro": "Sabulina graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in the summer. It is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
