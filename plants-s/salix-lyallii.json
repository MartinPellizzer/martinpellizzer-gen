    "intro": "Salix lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
