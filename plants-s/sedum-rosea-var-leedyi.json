    "intro": "Sedum rosea var. leedyi, commonly known as the Leedy's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for landscaping in dry climates."
