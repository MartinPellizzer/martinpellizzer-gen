    "intro": "Selaginella poulteri, commonly known as the Poulter's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Selaginella poulteri reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
