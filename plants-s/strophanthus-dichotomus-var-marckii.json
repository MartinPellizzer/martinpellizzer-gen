    "intro": "Strophanthus dichotomus var. marckii, commonly known as the red-stemmed African milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often red or purple in color, and its compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance, though caution is advised due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its tissues."
