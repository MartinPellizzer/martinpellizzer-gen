It features a compact, rounded form with a dense arrangement of dark green, leathery leaves that are narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its adaptability to various light conditions makes it a popular choice for both outdoor gardens and indoor spaces."
