    "intro": "Sarcococca ruscifolia, commonly known as the winter sweet, is a dense evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, followed by dark blue berries. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, making it an excellent choice for winter interest in gardens. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, and is often used in rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Sarcococca ruscifolia is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
