    "intro": "Stipa melanocarpa, commonly known as blackgrass or purple grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, dark green to bluish-gray blades. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or brown, giving it its common name. Stipa melanocarpa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
