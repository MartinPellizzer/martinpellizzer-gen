    "intro": "Siphocampylus psilophyllus, commonly known as the slender-leaved siphocampylus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or gravelly substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
