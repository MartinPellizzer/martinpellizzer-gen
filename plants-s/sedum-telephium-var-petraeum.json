    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. petraeum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
