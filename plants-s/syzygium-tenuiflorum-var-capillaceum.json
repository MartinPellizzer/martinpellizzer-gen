    "intro": "Syzygium tenuiflorum var. capillaceum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered tamarind, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal and semi-arid regions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in racemes. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its adaptability and resilience."
