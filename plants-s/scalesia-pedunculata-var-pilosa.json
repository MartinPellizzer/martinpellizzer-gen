    "intro": "Scalesia pedunculata var. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly tree heather, is a species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically covered in fine, white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. This plant plays an important ecological role in the unique ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos."
