The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits known as siliques. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Sinapis tenella is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
