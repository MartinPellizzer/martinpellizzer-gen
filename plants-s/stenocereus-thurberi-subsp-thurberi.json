    "intro": "Stenocereus thurberi subsp. thurberi, commonly known as the Thornless Hedgehog Cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem covered in spines, which are typically shorter and less prominent than in other species of the genus. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Its growth habit and morphology make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert landscaping."
