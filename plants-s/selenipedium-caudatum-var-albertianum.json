    "intro": "Selenipedium caudatum var. albertianum, commonly known as the Albert's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and relying on aerial roots for nutrients and moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall and well-draining substrate. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
