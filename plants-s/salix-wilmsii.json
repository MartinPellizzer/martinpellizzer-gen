    "intro": "Salix wilmsii, commonly known as the Wilmsii willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, willow-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, typical of the Salix genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Salix wilmsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
