    "intro": "Styloma remota, commonly known as the remote styloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Styloma remota is considered a vulnerable species."
