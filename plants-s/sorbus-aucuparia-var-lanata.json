    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a variant of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often growing in woodland or scrub habitats. Its small, white to yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. The leaves are typically elliptical with a serrated margin and a hairy underside."
