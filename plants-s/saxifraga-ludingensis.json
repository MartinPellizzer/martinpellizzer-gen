    "intro": "Saxifraga ludingensis, commonly known as the Luding saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga ludingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy garden plant."
