These plants are characterized by their small, spiny structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Spicillaria species are carnivorous, using their specialized structures to capture and digest prey. Their botanical features include delicate, floating leaves and specialized glands that secrete digestive enzymes."
