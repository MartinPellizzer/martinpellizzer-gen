    "intro": "Selaginella carnea, commonly known as the pink spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are typically reddish or pink in color, which give it its common name. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella carnea is a resurrection plant, capable of surviving extreme desiccation and reviving when water becomes available. Its unique ability to endure drought conditions makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
