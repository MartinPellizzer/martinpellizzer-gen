    "intro": "Silene grosiana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. Silene grosiana has hairy stems and leaves, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying regional flora."
