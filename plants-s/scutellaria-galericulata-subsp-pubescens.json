    "intro": "Scutellaria galericulata subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy skullcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its subspecies name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
