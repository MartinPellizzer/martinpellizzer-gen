    "intro": "Salix lindleyana f. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, narrow, elongated fruits. Its growth habit is often low and spreading, making it well-suited for erosion control in moist, sandy soils. This variety is part of the Salix genus, which includes many species of willows known for their ecological and ornamental value."
