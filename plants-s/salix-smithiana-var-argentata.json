    "intro": "Salix smithiana var. argentata, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The bark is typically smooth and gray, with some varieties displaying a flaky or peeling texture."
