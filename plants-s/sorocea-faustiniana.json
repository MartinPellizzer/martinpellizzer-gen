It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and unique morphological features, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures to preserve its existence."
