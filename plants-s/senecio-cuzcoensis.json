    "intro": "Senecio cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are yellow and arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
