    "intro": "Schizomeria orthophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved schizomeria, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, though it is not closely related to these food crops. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, round fruits that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. Schizomeria orthophlebia is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
