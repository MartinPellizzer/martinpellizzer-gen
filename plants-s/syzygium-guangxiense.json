It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible, sour fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarind but are less commonly consumed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Syzygium guangxiense is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
