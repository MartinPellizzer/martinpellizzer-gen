It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
