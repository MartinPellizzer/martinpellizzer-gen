    "intro": "Serpicula verticillata, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive spiral arrangement of its leaves, which gives it its common name. It produces spore capsules that are clustered in a vertical, spiraled pattern on the stem. Serpicula verticillata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
