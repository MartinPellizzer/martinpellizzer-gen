    "intro": "Sorbus pauca, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Sorbus pauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native range."
