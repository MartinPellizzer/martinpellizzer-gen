The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in the summer months. Sedum anhuiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
