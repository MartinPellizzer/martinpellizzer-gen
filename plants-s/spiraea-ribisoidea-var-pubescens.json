    "intro": "Spiraea ribisoidea var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is native to regions of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture on both surfaces, contributing to its common name. It produces abundant flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streamside habitats."
