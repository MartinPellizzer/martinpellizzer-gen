    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum conicum, commonly known as the cone-shaped shade plant, is a unique species native to the shaded understories of tropical forests. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive conical shape, which helps it maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure. Sciodaphyllum conicum is adapted to high humidity and requires consistent moisture to thrive. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in humid, tropical environments."
