    "intro": "Salix parcipila, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, red-brown female flowers that appear in the spring. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian habitats. Salix parcipila is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
