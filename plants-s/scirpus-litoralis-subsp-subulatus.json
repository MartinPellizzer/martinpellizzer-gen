    "intro": "Scirpus litoralis subsp. subulatus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a wetland plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in marshes and tidal flats. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems and its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
