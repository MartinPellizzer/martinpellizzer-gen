    "intro": "Stenocereus kerberi, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant bears small, edible fruits that resemble apples, hence its common name. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Stenocereus kerberi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
