    "intro": "Saxifraga cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, sunny environments. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Saxifraga cuneifolia is well adapted to harsh climates, making it a resilient and visually interesting plant for rock gardens or alpine displays."
