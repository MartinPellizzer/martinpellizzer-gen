    "intro": "Silene auriculifolia, commonly known as the auriculate catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Silene auriculifolia is a perennial species that plays a role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
