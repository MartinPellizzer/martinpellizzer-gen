    "intro": "Solenotheca tenella, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the surface. Its leaves are narrow and often clustered around the bladders, which are inflated and can be inflated or deflated depending on the water pressure. Solenotheca tenella is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
