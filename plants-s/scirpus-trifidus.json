    "intro": "Scirpus trifidus, commonly known as the three-ribbed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, strap-like, and often have a distinct three-ribbed structure, giving it its scientific name. Scirpus trifidus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
