    "intro": "Schoenia cassiniana, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, the Caribbean, and parts of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in brackish or saltwater environments. It has specialized root systems that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils and filter out salt. The plant produces small, white flowers and is an important component of mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
