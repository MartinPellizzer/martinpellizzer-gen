    "intro": "Schoenorchis endertii, commonly known as the Endert's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Schoenorchis endertii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
