    "intro": "Stachys elliptica var. repens, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette at the base, with stems that sprawl along the ground. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value and ability to spread vegetatively make it a popular choice in horticulture."
