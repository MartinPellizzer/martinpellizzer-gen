It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Selago racemosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
