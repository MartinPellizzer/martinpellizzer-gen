    "intro": "Sebipira major, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It possesses broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. Its striking white flowers bloom at night, releasing a strong scent to attract pollinators such as moths. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in shallow water and helps filter nutrients from the surrounding environment. Sebipira major plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and stabilizing water bodies."
