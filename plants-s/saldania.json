It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its unique, candle-like appearance. The plant features tall, unbranched stems with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Saldania is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant."
