    "intro": "Salix occidentalis, commonly known as the western willow, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its bark is often smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
