    "intro": "Specklinia wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's speckled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive foliage, which features a mottled pattern of green and silver. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Specklinia wrightii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in the ground."
