    "intro": "Sideroxylon lessertii, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in spikes. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, Sideroxylon lessertii is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
