    "intro": "Sonchus tenerrimus var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable sow thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from spoon-shaped to deeply lobed, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
