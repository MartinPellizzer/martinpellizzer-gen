    "intro": "Spathoglottis elobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spathoglottis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive spatulate lip, which is a hallmark of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
