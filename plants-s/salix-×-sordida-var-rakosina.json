    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sordida var. rakosina, commonly known as the Hungarian weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and drooping branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras as its fruit. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
