    "intro": "Stelis brunnea, commonly known as the brown stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features a short, creeping stem with numerous roots that anchor it to its substrate. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Stelis brunnea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
