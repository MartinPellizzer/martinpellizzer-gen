    "intro": "Satyrium giganteum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a vibrant pink or purple, with a unique lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
