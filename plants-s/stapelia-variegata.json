    "intro": "Stapelia variegata, commonly known as the variegated stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually small and fleshy, often with a variegated pattern of green and white. Stapelia variegata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
