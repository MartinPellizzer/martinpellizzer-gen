    "intro": "Scilla sinensis, commonly known as Chinese squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to China. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Scilla sinensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
