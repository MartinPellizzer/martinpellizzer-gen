    "intro": "Synexemia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf synexemia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
