    "intro": "Stipa arida, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale to brownish florets. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Stipa arida plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
