    "intro": "Saussurea pratensis, commonly known as alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saussurea pratensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
