    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 kalmthoutensis, commonly known as the Kalmthout willow, is a hybrid species native to the lowland areas of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The Kalmthout willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
