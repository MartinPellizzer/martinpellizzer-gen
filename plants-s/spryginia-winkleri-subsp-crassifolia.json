    "intro": "Spryginia winkleri subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spryginia, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
