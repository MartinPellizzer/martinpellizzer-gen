    "intro": "Sonchus lakouensis, commonly known as the swamp beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and serrated edges. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, prickly seed heads. Sonchus lakouensis is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed wetland habitats."
