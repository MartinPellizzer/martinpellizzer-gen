    "intro": "Serissa buxifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf serissa, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for topiary and bonsai, and it is often used in ornamental gardening. Serissa buxifolia thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
