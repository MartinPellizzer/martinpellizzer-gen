    "intro": "Senegalia pennata var. canescens, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall. Due to its hardiness, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for wildlife and livestock."
