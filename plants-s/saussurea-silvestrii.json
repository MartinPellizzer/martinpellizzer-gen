    "intro": "Saussurea silvestrii, commonly known as the Tibetan thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower heads that are surrounded by pale blue or white bracts. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
