    "intro": "Stapelia acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Stapelia acuminata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
