    "intro": "Suaeda stellatiflora, commonly known as the star-flowered saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink or red. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. Suaeda stellatiflora plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
