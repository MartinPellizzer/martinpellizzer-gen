    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua var. linnaeana, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features rosettes of oval, waxy, and often hairy leaves that are closely packed at the base. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions."
