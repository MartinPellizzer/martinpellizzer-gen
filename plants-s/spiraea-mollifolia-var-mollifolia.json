It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features arching stems covered in small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are hairy on the underside, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
