It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region."
