    "intro": "Sorghum amplectens, commonly known as the climbing sorghum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect or climbing growth habit, with elongated leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically pale green to reddish in color. Sorghum amplectens is adapted to thrive in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in erosion control."
