    "intro": "Sedum uniflorum subsp. oryzifolium, commonly known as the riceleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for arid landscapes."
