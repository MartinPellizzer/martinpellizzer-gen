It is a natural hybrid between Salix nigra and Salix discolor, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils along streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Its flowers are catkins, which contribute to its role in pollination and seed dispersal."
