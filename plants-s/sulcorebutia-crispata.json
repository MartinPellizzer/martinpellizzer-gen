    "intro": "Sulcorebutia crispata, commonly known as the crinkled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South America. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure. The plant features fleshy, crinkled leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring or early summer. Sulcorebutia crispata is well-suited for rock gardens and dry environments due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
