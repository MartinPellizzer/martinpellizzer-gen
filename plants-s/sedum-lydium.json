    "intro": "Sedum lydium, commonly known as the Lydian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum lydium is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it an ideal choice for low-water landscapes."
