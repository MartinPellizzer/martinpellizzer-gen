    "intro": "Stelis vulcanica, commonly known as the Volcanic Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its epiphytic nature allows it to grow on trees or rocks, often in volcanic areas, hence its common name. Stelis vulcanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
