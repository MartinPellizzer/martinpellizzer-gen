    "intro": "Samudra, commonly known as the sea or ocean, is not a plant but a vast body of saltwater. However, it plays a crucial role in the global ecosystem by supporting marine life and influencing climate patterns. While not a botanical entity, the term \"Samudra\" is often used in traditional contexts to describe large water bodies. In some cultural or poetic references, it may be metaphorically linked to plants that thrive near water. Its presence shapes the growth of coastal flora and aquatic vegetation."
