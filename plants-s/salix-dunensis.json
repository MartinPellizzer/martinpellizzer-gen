    "intro": "Salix dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and its ability to thrive in saline and coastal environments. The plant has a flexible stem that often grows close to the ground, forming dense clumps. Its flowers are catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, round fruits. Salix dunensis is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
