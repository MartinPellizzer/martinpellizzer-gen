It has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in stabilizing the soil in aquatic environments. This variety is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes."
