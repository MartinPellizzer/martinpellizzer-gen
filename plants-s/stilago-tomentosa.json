    "intro": "Stilago tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, and it is often found in dune ecosystems. Stilago tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
