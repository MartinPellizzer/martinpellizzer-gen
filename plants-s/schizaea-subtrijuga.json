    "intro": "Schizaea subtrijuga, commonly known as the triquetrous clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen, non-vascular plant characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. Its sporophytes develop in specialized structures called strobila, which bear microsporangia and megasporangia. Schizaea subtrijuga is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
