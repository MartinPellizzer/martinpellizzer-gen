    "intro": "Symplocos cerasifolia var. cerasifolia, commonly known as the cherry-leaf symplocos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters, featuring a dense, rounded crown and smooth, reddish-brown bark. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and turn a striking red or orange in autumn, making it a notable ornamental plant. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
