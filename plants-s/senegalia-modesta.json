    "intro": "Senegalia modesta, commonly known as the Texas screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soils. Its leaves are typically small and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Senegalia modesta plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
