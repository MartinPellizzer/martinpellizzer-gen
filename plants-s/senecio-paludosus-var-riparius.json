It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to periodic flooding. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in riparian zones where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects. This species is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
