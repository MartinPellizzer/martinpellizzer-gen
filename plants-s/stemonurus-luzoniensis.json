    "intro": "Stemonurus luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, often at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
