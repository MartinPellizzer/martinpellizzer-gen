    "intro": "Sempervivum canariense, commonly known as the Canary Island houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern. The leaves are fleshy, thick, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or summer. This plant is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun."
