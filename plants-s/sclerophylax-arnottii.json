    "intro": "Sclerophylax arnottii, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which is an adaptation to arid and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a hardy ornamental plant. Sclerophylax arnottii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides habitat for local wildlife."
