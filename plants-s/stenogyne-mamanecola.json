    "intro": "Stenogyne mamanecola, commonly known as the Kauai false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface and is often found in association with other endemic Hawaiian flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
