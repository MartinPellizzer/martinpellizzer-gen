    "intro": "Stenostephanus gigas, commonly known as the giant stephanos, is a unique and rare plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenostephanus gigas is considered a conservation concern."
