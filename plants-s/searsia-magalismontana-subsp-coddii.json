    "intro": "Searsia magalismontana subsp. coddii, commonly known as the Codd's wild pear, is a shrub native to the Eastern Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
