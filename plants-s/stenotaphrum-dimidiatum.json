    "intro": "Stenotaphrum dimidiatum, commonly known as common carpetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and its ability to form a thick sod, making it a common weed in lawns and pastures. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a dark green color and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Stenotaphrum dimidiatum is often used in erosion control due to its strong root system and rapid growth."
