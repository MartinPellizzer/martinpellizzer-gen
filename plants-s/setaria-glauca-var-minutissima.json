    "intro": "Setaria glauca var. minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf barnyard grass, is a small annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, where it can become a weed. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is a common species in regions with warm climates."
