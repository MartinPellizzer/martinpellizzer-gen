    "intro": "Sagina alpina, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of alpine vegetation. Sagina alpina is also valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and as a ground cover in horticulture."
