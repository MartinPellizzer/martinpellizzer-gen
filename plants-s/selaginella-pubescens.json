    "intro": "Selaginella pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella pubescens reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
