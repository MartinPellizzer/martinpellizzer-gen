    "intro": "Salix rorida f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like flowing water. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. The weeping willow is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
