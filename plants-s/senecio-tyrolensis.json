    "intro": "Senecio tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrolean groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Senecio tyrolensis is adapted to cold climates and is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
