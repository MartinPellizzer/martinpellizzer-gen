    "intro": "Scilla holzmannia, commonly known as the Holzmann's scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, though it benefits from moderate watering during its growing season. Scilla holzmannia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
