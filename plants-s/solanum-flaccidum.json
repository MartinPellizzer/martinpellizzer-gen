    "intro": "Solanum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, often sprawling stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. Solanum flaccidum is part of the nightshade family, which includes many toxic plants, though its toxicity is less well-documented. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of arid or semi-arid environments."
