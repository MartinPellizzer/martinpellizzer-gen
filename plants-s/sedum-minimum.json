    "intro": "Sedum minimum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features compact, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. Sedum minimum prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
