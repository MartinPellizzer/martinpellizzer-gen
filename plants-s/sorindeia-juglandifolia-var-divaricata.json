    "intro": "Sorindeia juglandifolia var. divaricata, commonly known as the spreading winged elm, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches that give it a distinctive, airy appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
