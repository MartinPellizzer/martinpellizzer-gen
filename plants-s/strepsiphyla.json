    "intro": "Strepsiphyla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has long, slender roots that help it anchor to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
