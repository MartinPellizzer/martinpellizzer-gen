    "intro": "Samadera mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong samadera, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Mekong River basin. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
