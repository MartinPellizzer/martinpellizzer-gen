    "intro": "Struthanthus cansjerifolius, commonly known as the desert four-o'clock, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the tribe Cistantheae within the family Caryophyllaceae, characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that open in the late afternoon, closing at dawn, a trait typical of many members of the Malvaceae family. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to conserve water, reflecting its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Struthanthus cansjerifolius is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria, enhancing its survival in nutrient-poor soils."
