    "intro": "Selaginella brooksii, commonly known as the climbing clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on rocky or sandy soils. This plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. Selaginella brooksii is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, often growing in crevices or on exposed rock surfaces. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
