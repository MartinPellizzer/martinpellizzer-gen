    "intro": "Solanum callium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and they contain toxic compounds similar to those found in other nightshade species. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food or ornamental purposes."
