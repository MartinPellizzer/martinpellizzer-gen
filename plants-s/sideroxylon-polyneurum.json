    "intro": "Sideroxylon polyneurum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for carpentry and furniture-making."
