    "intro": "Salomonia cavaleriei, commonly known as the Cavalerie's salomonia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salomonia cavaleriei is considered a conservation concern."
