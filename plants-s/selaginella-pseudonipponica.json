    "intro": "Selaginella pseudonipponica, commonly known as the Japanese clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and ferns. Its rhizomes are often covered in a protective layer of moss-like structures, which help in water retention. Selaginella pseudonipponica is also noted for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its potential medicinal properties."
