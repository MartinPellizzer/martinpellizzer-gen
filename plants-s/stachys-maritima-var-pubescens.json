    "intro": "Stachys maritima var. pubescens, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. The plant has hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its saline and windy habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
