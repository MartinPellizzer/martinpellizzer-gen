    "intro": "Salix marichalii, commonly known as the Marichal willow, is a species of willow native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually yellow-green in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Salix marichalii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
