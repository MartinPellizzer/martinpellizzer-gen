    "intro": "Synaphea spinulosa subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic synaphea, is a rare and specialized plant found in the Arctic tundra. It is a small, cushion-like plant with dense, mat-forming growth habit, adapted to the harsh, cold climate. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and covered in a thick layer of wax to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It plays a vital role in the tundra ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various arctic invertebrates."
