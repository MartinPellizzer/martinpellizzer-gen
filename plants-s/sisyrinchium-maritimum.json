    "intro": "Sisyrinchium maritimum, commonly known as sea blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and well-drained conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sisyrinchium maritimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune habitats and providing nectar for pollinators."
