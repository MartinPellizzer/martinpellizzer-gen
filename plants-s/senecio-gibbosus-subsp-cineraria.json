    "intro": "Senecio gibbosus subsp. cineraria, commonly known as the ash-gray groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
