    "intro": "Saxifraga glauca, commonly known as the blue saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra habitats. Saxifraga glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, colorful appearance."
