    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 multinervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched form and its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, and it is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. It has a moderate growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas. Its hybrid origin contributes to its genetic variability and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
