    "intro": "Sanamunda subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf sanamunda, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
