    "intro": "Styphelia coelophylla, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coast of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Styphelia coelophylla plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
