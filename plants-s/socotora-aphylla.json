It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and long, drooping fronds. The plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climate of its native habitat, featuring a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water. Its leaves are typically pale green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The Socotora aphylla plays an important ecological role in its environment and is also valued for its historical and cultural significance."
