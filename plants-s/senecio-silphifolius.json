    "intro": "Senecio silphifolius, commonly known as the Great Basin Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky areas, where it has adapted to survive with minimal water. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and summer, producing yellow to orange petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
