    "intro": "Strychnos tseasnum, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain seeds covered in a silky, white coating. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
