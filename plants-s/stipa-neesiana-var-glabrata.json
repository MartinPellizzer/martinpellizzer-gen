    "intro": "Stipa neesiana var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and slender, drooping inflorescences that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are glabrous, meaning they lack hairs, and the plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
