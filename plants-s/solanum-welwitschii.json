    "intro": "Solanum welwitschii, commonly known as the welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It has adapted to extreme arid conditions through its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves. Solanum welwitschii is also notable for its slow growth rate and longevity, with some individuals living over 1,000 years."
