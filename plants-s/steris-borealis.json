    "intro": "Steris borealis, commonly known as the northern ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the Arctic tundra. It possesses a unique structure with a short, erect stem and a cluster of pale green, delicate fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to grow. Its reproductive cycle involves the production of spores rather than seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Steris borealis is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a bioindicator of Arctic climate conditions."
