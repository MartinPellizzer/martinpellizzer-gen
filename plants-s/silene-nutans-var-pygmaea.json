It features slender, branching stems that typically rise to a height of only a few inches. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Silene nutans var. pygmaea thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes."
