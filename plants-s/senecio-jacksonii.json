    "intro": "Senecio jacksonii, commonly known as Jackson's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
