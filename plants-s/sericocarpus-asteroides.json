    "intro": "Sericocarpus asteroides, commonly known as the starry thistle, is a flowering plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which are enclosed in a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically grayish-green with a woolly texture, and it blooms with purple to pinkish flowers in the summer. Sericocarpus asteroides thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes."
