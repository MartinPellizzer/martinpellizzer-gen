    "intro": "Symphonia gabonensis var. macrantha, commonly known as the Gabon ironwood, is a towering evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, round fruits containing several seeds. Its dense wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
