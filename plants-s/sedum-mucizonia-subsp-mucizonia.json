    "intro": "Sedum mucizonia subsp. mucizonia, commonly known as the sticky sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in xeriscaping."
