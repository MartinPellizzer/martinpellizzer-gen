    "intro": "Sarcochilus fuscoluteus, commonly known as the golden thread orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a slender, wiry stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, showy lip petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understoreys. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
