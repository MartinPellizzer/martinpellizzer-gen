    "intro": "Salix nakamurana f. eriocarpa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a unique variant of the native willow species found in Japan. This shrub or small tree is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas."
