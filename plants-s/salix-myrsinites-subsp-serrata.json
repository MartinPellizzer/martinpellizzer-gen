    "intro": "Salix myrsinites subsp. serrata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The leaves are narrow, serrated, and typically have a silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and seed dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
