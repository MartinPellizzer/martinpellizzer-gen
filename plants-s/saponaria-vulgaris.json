    "intro": "Saponaria vulgaris, commonly known as the common soapwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, soap-like pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its name derives from the saponin compounds in its roots, which produce a soapy lather when crushed."
