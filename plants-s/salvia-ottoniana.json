    "intro": "Salvia ottoniana, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable for pollinators."
