    "intro": "Serianthes melanesica var. samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the islands of Samoa and nearby Pacific regions. It is characterized by its dense, dark-brown timber, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
