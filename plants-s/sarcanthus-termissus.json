    "intro": "Sarcanthus termissus, commonly known as the misty spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
