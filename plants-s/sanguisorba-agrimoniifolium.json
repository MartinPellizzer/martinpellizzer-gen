    "intro": "Sanguisorba agrimoniifolium, commonly known as the agrimonium sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for use in traditional medicine. Sanguisorba agrimoniifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
