    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis subsp. neotricha, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
