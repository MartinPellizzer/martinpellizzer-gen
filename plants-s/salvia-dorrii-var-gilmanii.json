It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is known for its aromatic foliage and showy flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
