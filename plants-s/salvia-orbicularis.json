    "intro": "Salvia orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its orbicular, or round, leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Salvia orbicularis is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
