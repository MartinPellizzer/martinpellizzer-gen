    "intro": "Smithiantha fulgida, commonly known as the golden bells, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Smithiantha fulgida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
