    "intro": "Santolina valida, commonly known as Spanish santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, aromatic foliage composed of silver-gray, needle-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the summer, which are often overlooked but contribute to its ornamental value. Santolina valida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its essential oils are also used in aromatherapy and as a natural insect repellent."
