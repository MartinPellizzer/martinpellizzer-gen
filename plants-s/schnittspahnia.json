    "intro": "Schnittspahnia, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with upright, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its sporophytes produce spore capsules at the tips of its branches. Schnittspahnia is characterized by its simple, primitive structure, reflecting its ancient lineage among vascular plants."
