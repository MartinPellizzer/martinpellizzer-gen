    "intro": "Solanum puberulofructus, commonly known as the pubescent-fruited nightshade, is a species within the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"puberulofructus.\" The plant produces small, typically green or yellowish fruits that are often covered in fine pubescence. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. Due to its potential toxicity, it is generally avoided for cultivation or consumption."
