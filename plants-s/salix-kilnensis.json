    "intro": "Salix kilnensis, commonly known as the Korean willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale or whitish underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Salix kilnensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
