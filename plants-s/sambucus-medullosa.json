    "intro": "Sambucus medullosa, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces dark red berries that are toxic when raw but can be used in cooking after proper preparation. Sambucus medullosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and historical contexts."
