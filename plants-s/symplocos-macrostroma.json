    "intro": "Symplocos macrostroma, commonly known as the large-fruited snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Symplocos macrostroma thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
