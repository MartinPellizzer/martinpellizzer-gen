    "intro": "Stachys germanica var. procera, commonly known as tall hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
