    "intro": "Salvia psilophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant collections. Salvia psilophylla is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
