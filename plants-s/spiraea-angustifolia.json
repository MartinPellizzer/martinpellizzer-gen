    "intro": "Spiraea angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, arching stems covered in small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. Its foliage turns vibrant yellow in autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. Spiraea angustifolia is often used in landscaping for its attractive form and seasonal interest."
