It is characterized by its elongated, needle-shaped thallus that can grow up to several centimeters in length. The plant typically inhabits marine environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives on rocky substrates. Its structure consists of a unbranched, filamentous body with a central axis and lateral branches. Sarcinula acicularis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms."
