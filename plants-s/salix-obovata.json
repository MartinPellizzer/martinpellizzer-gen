    "intro": "Salix obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper to a point. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in the spring. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and smooth when young, becoming fissured with age. Salix obovata is adapted to moist environments and is often found in stream banks and moist woodlands."
