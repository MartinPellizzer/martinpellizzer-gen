    "intro": "Solanum laciniatum f. cultum, commonly known as the cultivated form of the cutleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which give it its common name, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for use in food or medicinal applications."
