    "intro": "Sclerothamnus purpusii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the spring and summer months. Its botanical features, including its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil, make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
