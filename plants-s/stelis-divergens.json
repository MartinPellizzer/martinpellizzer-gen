    "intro": "Stelis divergens, commonly known as the diverging stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose spike. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis divergens is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests."
