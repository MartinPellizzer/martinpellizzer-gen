    "intro": "Solanum narcoticum, commonly known as the narcotic nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its spiny stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
