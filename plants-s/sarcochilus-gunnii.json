It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred labellum. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
