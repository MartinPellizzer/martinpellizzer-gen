The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and is known for its resilience to harsh conditions. Salix magellanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
