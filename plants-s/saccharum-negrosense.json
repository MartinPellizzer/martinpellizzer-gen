    "intro": "Saccharum negrosense, commonly known as the Negros grass, is a species of tall, perennial grass native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth and long, narrow leaves that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, clustered flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often found in coastal areas and riverbanks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, Saccharum negrosense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
