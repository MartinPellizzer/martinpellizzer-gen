    "intro": "Syzygium angkae subsp. spissum, commonly known as the thick-leaved tamarind, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by edible, sour fruits resembling those of the tamarind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
