    "intro": "Salix attenuatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
