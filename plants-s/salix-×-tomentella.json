    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 tomentella, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian zones. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it is primarily wind-pollinated. The silver willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for landscaping purposes."
