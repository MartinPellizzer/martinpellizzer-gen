    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. cotoneaster, commonly known as the cotoneaster willow, is a variant of the willow family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are cylindrical clusters of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its bark is often smooth and grayish, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced with age. This variant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, temperate environments."
