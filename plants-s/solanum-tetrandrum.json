    "intro": "Solanum tetrandrum, commonly known as the four-angled nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
