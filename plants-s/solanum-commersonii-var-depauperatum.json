It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its botanical features make it a resilient species in xerophytic ecosystems."
