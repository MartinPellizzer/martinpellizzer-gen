    "intro": "Selliguea tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like body, and its leaves are usually three-lobed, giving it its common name. Selliguea tricuspis reproduces via spores, which are released from capsule-like structures called sporangia located on the leaf surfaces. It is often found in temperate regions and is a common indicator species for humid, shaded habitats."
