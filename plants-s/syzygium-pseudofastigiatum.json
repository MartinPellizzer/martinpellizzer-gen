    "intro": "Syzygium pseudofastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarind. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Syzygium pseudofastigiatum is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
