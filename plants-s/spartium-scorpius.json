    "intro": "Spartium scorpius, commonly known as goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its distinctive, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces legumes as its fruit, which contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Spartium scorpius is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
