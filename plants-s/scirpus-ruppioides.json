    "intro": "Scirpus ruppioides, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often found in stream banks, wetlands, and mountainous areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained yet water-retentive soils. Scirpus ruppioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
