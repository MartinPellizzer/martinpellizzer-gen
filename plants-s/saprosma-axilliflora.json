    "intro": "Saprosma axilliflora, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Saprosma axilliflora is relatively drought-tolerant and can withstand salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal habitats."
