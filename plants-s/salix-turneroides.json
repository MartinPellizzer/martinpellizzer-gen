    "intro": "Salix turneroides, commonly known as Turner's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
