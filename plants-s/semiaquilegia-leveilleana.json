    "intro": "Semiaquilegia leveilleana, commonly known as the water violets, is a rare aquatic or semiaquatic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive violet hue. Its leaves are submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
