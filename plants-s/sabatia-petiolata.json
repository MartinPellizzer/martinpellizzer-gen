    "intro": "Sabatia petiolata, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as fields and dunes. It produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
