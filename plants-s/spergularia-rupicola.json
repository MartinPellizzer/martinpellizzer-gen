    "intro": "Spergularia rupicola, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, often growing on limestone or sandstone. Its root system helps it anchor in shallow, nutrient-poor soils. Spergularia rupicola is also notable for its ability to tolerate high levels of salt and drought."
