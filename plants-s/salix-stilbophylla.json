    "intro": "Salix stilbophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix stilbophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize stream banks."
