    "intro": "Syringa pubescens f. pilosa, commonly known as the fuzzy lilac, is a cultivar of the syringa plant characterized by its dense, soft, and hairy foliage. It is native to China and is prized for its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of 2 to 4 meters, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun. Its unique fuzzy texture distinguishes it from other syringa varieties, making it a popular choice in ornamental gardening. The leaves are dark green and provide a striking contrast to the pale pink or white flowers."
