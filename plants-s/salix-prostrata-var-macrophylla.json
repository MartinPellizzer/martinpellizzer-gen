    "intro": "Salix prostrata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are broad, elliptical, and covered with a dense layer of silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. It produces catkins that are typically yellow-green, with both male and female flowers on the same plant. This species is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils and cold climates."
