    "intro": "Spiraea crispifolia minor, commonly known as the dwarf meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a finely toothed margin, and turn yellow in the autumn. Spiraea crispifolia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
