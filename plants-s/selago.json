    "intro": "Selago, commonly known as sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, often blue or purple flowers. Selago species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. Their leaves are usually succulent, helping them conserve water in harsh environments."
