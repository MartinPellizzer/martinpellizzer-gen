    "intro": "Silene cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian campion, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it has a robust root system adapted to its harsh environment. Silene cantabrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in ecological studies due to its specific habitat requirements."
