    "intro": "Spathelia neblinaensis, commonly known as the Neblina mist orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendant-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often resembling small, intricate lanterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain water in its misty habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Spathelia neblinaensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
