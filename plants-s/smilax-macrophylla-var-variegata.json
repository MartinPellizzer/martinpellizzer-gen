It features heart-shaped, variegated leaves with a mix of green, white, and yellow colors, which make it visually striking. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic, tropical effect."
