    "intro": "Salvia simplex, commonly known as woodland sage, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Salvia simplex is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
