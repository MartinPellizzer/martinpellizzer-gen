    "intro": "Styloncerus platycephalus, commonly known as the flat-headed styloncerus, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its distinctive flat, broad head and elongated body, which are adaptations for its specific ecological niche. The beetle's exoskeleton is typically hardened and often exhibits a metallic or dark coloration, providing camouflage in its natural habitat. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it inhabits forested areas. Due to its specialized morphology and limited distribution, Styloncerus platycephalus is of interest to entomologists studying biodiversity and ecological specialization."
