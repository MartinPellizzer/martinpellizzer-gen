    "intro": "Spergularia pycnorrhiza, commonly known as the woolly sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Spergularia pycnorrhiza is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands."
