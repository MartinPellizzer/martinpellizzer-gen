    "intro": "Solanum glabratum var. erysimifolium, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its foliage consists of ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance."
