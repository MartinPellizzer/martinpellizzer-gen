    "intro": "Solidago bombycina, commonly known as the woolly goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Solidago bombycina plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the autumn season."
