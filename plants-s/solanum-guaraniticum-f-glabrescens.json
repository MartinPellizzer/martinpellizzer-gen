    "intro": "Solanum guaraniticum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved wild tomato, is a variant of the wild tomato species native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous foliage, which distinguishes it from other forms of Solanum guaraniticum. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals, and it produces small, orange-red berries that contain seeds. This plant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its potential for cultivation and its genetic relationship to economically important tomato species."
