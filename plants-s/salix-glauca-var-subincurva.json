    "intro": "Salix glauca var. subincurva, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-green leaves and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its branches are often twisted and contorted, giving it a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones."
