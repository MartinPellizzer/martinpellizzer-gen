    "intro": "Selatium assurgens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become an invasive species in certain areas."
