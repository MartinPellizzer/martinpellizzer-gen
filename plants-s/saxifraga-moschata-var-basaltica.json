    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata var. basaltica, commonly known as the basalt saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing on rocky outcrops and mountain slopes. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient and hardy species."
