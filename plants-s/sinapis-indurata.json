    "intro": "Sinapis indurata, commonly known as the rough mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, capsule-like structure, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Sinapis indurata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
