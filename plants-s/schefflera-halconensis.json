    "intro": "Schefflera halconensis, commonly known as the Halcon Island Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Halcon in the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which gives it a distinctive and lush appearance. The plant features smooth, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries. Schefflera halconensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
