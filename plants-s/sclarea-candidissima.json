    "intro": "Sclarea candidissima, commonly known as the white angelica, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent reminiscent of other members of its family.
