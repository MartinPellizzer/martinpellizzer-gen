    "intro": "Scottellia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of fleshy, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Scottellia schweinfurthii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
