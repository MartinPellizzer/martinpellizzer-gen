    "intro": "Syringa tomentella subsp. sweginzowii, commonly known as the Siberian lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale lilac flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and has a compact, upright growth habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This subspecies is more cold-hardy than the common lilac, making it suitable for colder climates."
