    "intro": "Stenogyne longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, tubular flowers that are typically visited by native bees and birds. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Stenogyne longiloba is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and streamside areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
