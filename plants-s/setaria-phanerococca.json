    "intro": "Setaria phanerococca, commonly known as the tall sandgrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. Setaria phanerococca plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
