    "intro": "Senegalia westiana, commonly known as the Texas acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow, globular flower heads. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes."
