    "intro": "Solanum ultimum, commonly known as the wild potato or small potato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean region, and is characterized by its tuberous roots that resemble small potatoes. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Solanum ultimum is not commonly cultivated but is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
