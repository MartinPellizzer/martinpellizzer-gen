It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a striking red or orange color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
