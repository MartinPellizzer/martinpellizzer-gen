    "intro": "Senecio crassiflorus var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal senecio, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. This variety is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy and resilient species."
