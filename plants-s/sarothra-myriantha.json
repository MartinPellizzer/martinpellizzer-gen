    "intro": "Sarothra myriantha, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sarothra myriantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
