    "intro": "Solanum plousianthemum var. devians, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
