    "intro": "Solanum lycocarpum f. eumacrocarpum, commonly known as the red currant tomato, is a botanical variant of the currant tomato species. It is characterized by its distinctive red, currant-like fruits that are typically smaller than those of the standard Solanum lycocarpum. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are yellow and star-shaped, typical of the Solanaceae family. The fruit develops from a single ovary and is often used in culinary applications due to its tart flavor."
