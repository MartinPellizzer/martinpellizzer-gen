    "intro": "Stapelia aurea, commonly known as the yellow starfish, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, star-shaped leaves that are typically yellow with red or orange markings. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Stapelia aurea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
