    "intro": "Stipa formosa, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of spikelets that often display a distinctive purple hue. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Stipa formosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
