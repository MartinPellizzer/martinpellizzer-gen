    "intro": "Senecio grandissimus, commonly known as the giant African daisy, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a bushy growth habit with hairy, silver-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
