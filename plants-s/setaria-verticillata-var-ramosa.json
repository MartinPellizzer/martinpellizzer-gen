It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant produces slender, branched stems with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three flowering bracts. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in challenging conditions."
