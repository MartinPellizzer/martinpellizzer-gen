It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, characterized by its preference for cool and temperate climates. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by berries that ripen to a deep purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
