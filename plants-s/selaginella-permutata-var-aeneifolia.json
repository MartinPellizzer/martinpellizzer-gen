    "intro": "Selaginella permutata var. aeneifolia, commonly known as the steel-green spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that exhibits a metallic, steel-gray sheen, particularly on the undersides of the leaves. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are linear and spirally arranged, with a distinct midrib that enhances its structural appearance. This variety is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices."
