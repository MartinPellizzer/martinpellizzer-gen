    "intro": "Stellaria americana, commonly known as white-stemmed starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer, producing star-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and covered in fine hairs, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks or in meadows. Stellaria americana is a hardy species that thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
