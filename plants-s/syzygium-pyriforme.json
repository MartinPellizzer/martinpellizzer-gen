    "intro": "Syzygium pyriforme, commonly known as the starfruit or carambola, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is distinctive for its five-pointed star shape when sliced, with a sour-sweet flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Syzygium pyriforme is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and is also used in traditional medicine."
