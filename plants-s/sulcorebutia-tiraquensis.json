    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis, commonly known as the Tiraqu\u00e9n Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Sulcorebutia tiraquensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
