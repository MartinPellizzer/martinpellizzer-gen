    "intro": "Sapindus drummondii, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces spherical, spiny fruits that contain a single seed, and its bark is often used in traditional medicine. The leaves and fruits are also used as natural soaps due to their saponin content, which creates a foaming effect when mixed with water."
