It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are lobed and somewhat hairy. It produces distinctive triangular seed pods that split open when mature, dispersing its seeds. Sisymbrium pseudosophia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
