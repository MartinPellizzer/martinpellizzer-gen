    "intro": "Seriphium phyllostachyum, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in elongated clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Seriphium phyllostachyum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
