    "intro": "Stenochlaena cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Stenochlaena cordata is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
