    "intro": "Salvia flaccida, commonly known as the drooping sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly fuzzy texture. Salvia flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
