    "intro": "Salix traunsteineri, commonly known as Traunsteiner's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on both surfaces. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, with the female flowers clustered in short, drooping inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
