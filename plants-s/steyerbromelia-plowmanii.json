    "intro": "Steyerbromelia plowmanii, commonly known as the Plowman's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a flower but is actually a modified leaf. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom sequentially along the inflorescence, often lasting several months. Its rosette-shaped leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps retain moisture. Steyerbromelia plowmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
