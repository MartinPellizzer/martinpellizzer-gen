    "intro": "Synexemia caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and coastal dunes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Synexemia caroliniana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a characteristic species of its habitat."
