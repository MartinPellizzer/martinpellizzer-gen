    "intro": "Struthiopteris falciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bracken, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Struthiopteris falciformis is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils."
