    "intro": "Suaeda fruticosa subsp. vera, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Its ability to thrive in high-salt environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
