    "intro": "Senecio silphiifolius, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and canyons. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
