    "intro": "Scorzonera racemosa, commonly known as the rock scurvygrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Scorzonera racemosa is often found growing in crevices and on slopes, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
