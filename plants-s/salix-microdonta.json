    "intro": "Salix microdonta, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix microdonta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of cold climate ecosystems."
