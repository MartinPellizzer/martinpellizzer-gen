    "intro": "Sclerocarpus phyllocephalus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and thick foliage to conserve water. Sclerocarpus phyllocephalus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
