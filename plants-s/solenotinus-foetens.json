    "intro": "Solenotinus foetens, commonly known as the stinking solenotinus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant's strong, unpleasant odor is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
