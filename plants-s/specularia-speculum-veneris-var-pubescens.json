    "intro": "Specularia speculum-veneris var. pubescens, commonly known as the Venus' looking glass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, silvery-blue flowers that resemble mirrors, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is known for its hairy, pubescent leaves that give it the specific epithet *pubescens*. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. The flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
