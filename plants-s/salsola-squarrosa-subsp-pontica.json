    "intro": "Salsola squarrosa subsp. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic sandthorn, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It features succulent, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by bead-like, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is native to the steppes and semi-deserts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. Its botanical characteristics make it a resilient species for ecological restoration in degraded soils."
