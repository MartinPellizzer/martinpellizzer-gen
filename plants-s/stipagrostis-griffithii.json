    "intro": "Stipagrostis griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
