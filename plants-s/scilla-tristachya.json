    "intro": "Scilla tristachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are edible when young but become toxic as they mature. Scilla tristachya is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and hardy nature."
