    "intro": "Sporobolus caespitosus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its roots form a deep, extensive network, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus caespitosus is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
