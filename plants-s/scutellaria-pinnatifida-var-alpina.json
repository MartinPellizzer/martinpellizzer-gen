It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
