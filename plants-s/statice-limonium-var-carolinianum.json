    "intro": "Statice limonium var. carolinianum, commonly known as Carolina sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its narrow, linear leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal climates."
