    "intro": "Selaginella pulcherrima, commonly known as the Christmas moss or spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a dense, moss-like appearance with slender, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces sporophytes that are often mistaken for true mosses, but it is actually a vascular plant with a distinct root system. Selaginella pulcherrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
