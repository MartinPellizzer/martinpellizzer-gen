    "intro": "Sloanea celebica, commonly known as the Celebes sloanea, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Indonesia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
