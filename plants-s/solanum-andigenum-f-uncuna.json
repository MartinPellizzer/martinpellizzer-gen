It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Andean cuisine. Its foliage is usually hairy and adapted to thrive in cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its potential in plant breeding and conservation efforts."
