It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (circle-shaped) leaves that are thick and leathery, providing a unique texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
