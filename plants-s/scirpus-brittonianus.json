    "intro": "Scirpus brittonianus, commonly known as Britton's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, and it has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Scirpus brittonianus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
