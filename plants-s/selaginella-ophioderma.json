    "intro": "Selaginella ophioderma, commonly known as the creeping spike moss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged along its creeping stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on specialized branches and contain spores. Selaginella ophioderma is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
