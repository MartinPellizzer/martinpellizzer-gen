    "intro": "Sonerila linearis, commonly known as the linear begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, with elongated, linear leaves that give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value. Sonerila linearis is also noted for its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it anchor to trees in its natural habitat."
