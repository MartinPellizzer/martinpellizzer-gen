    "intro": "Salix raupii, commonly known as the Raupii willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix raupii thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
