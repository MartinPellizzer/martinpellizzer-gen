    "intro": "Scyphostelma pichinchense, commonly known as the Pichincha star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas with cool climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
