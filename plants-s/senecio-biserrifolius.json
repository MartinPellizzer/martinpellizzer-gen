    "intro": "Senecio biserrifolius, commonly known as the double-toothed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often on rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are doubly serrated, giving it the common name, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
