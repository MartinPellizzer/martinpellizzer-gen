    "intro": "Salix calceoloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones, along stream banks, and in wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat."
