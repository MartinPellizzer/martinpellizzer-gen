    "intro": "Sida rohlenae subsp. rohlenae, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
