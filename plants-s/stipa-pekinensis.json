    "intro": "Stipa pekinensis, commonly known as the Peking grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Stipa pekinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
