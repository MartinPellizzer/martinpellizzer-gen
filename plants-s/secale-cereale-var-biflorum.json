It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of two spikelets, giving it the \"biflorum\" designation, and it produces small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
