    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. schnittspahnii, commonly known as the Schnittspahnii potato, is a rare variety of potato characterized by its unique tuber morphology. The tubers are typically elongated and have a thin, smooth skin that ranges in color from light yellow to reddish-brown. This variety is native to Central and South America, where it is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than commercial use due to its delicate appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
