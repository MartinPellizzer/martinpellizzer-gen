    "intro": "Sphaeropteris robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
