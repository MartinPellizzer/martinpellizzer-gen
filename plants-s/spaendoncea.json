    "intro": "Spaendoncea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, slender, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly apparition. The plant lacks a visible root system and instead relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are typically small, strap-like, and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Spaendoncea is considered a critically endangered species."
