    "intro": "Solanum rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solasodine. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
