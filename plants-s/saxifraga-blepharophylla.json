    "intro": "Saxifraga blepharophylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that appear in late summer, often in clusters. The plant has a low, mat-like growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
