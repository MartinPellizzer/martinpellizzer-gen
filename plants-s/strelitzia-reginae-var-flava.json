It is characterized by its unique, banana-like leaves that are a vibrant green, often with a subtle yellowish tinge. The plant produces striking orange and yellow inflorescences that resemble bird beaks, adding a dramatic visual element. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
