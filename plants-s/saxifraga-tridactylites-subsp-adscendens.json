It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in subarctic and alpine tundras. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
