    "intro": "Solidago chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden rod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and marshes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Solidago chrysolepis plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the autumn season."
