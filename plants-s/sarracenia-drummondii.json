    "intro": "Sarracenia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, often found in bogs and marshes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
