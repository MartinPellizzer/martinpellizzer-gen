It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent central disks, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Siphocampylus impressus is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
