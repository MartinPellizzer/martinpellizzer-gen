    "intro": "Sagittaria cycloptera, commonly known as the spiral arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Sagittaria cycloptera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates."
