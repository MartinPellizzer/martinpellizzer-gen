    "intro": "Salvia verbenaca subsp. lanigera, commonly known as woolly blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, woolly leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a unique appearance and helps reduce water loss."
