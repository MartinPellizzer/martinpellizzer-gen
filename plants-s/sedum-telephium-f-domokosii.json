    "intro": "Sedum telephium f. domokosii, commonly known as the Hungarian stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing succulent with fleshy, blue-green leaves. It produces upright, branched inflorescences of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Native to Hungary and parts of the Balkans, this variety thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its foliage is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental appeal. The plant is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
