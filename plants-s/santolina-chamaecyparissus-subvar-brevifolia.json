    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subvar. brevifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, needle-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
