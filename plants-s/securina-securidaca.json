    "intro": "Securina securidaca, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in herbal remedies, though it is toxic if ingested in large quantities."
