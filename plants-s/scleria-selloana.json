    "intro": "Scleria selloana, commonly known as the Selloan bulbous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typically in shades of white or green. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Scleria selloana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions."
