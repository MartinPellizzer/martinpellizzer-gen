    "intro": "Sambucus hirta, commonly known as the hairy elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. The hairy elderberry is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
