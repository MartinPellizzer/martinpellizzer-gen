    "intro": "Solanum platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaf nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food or ornamental purposes."
