    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara subsp. pusztarum, commonly known as the Hungarian bindweed, is a perennial vine native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to pink as they mature. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange, are toxic but serve as a food source for certain birds. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions."
