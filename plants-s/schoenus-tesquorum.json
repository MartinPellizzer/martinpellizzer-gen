    "intro": "Schoenus tesquorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Schoenus tesquorum plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems through its water filtration and erosion control capabilities."
