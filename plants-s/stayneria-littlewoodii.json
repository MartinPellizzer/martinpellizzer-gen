    "intro": "Stayneria littlewoodii, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in wetlands and ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
