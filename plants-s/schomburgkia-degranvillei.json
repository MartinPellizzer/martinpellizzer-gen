    "intro": "Schomburgkia degranvillei, commonly known as the De Granville's orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Schomburgkia degranvillei is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
