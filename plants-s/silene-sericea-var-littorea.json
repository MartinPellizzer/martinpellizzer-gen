    "intro": "Silene sericea var. littorea, commonly known as sea silk, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky shorelines, often in saline or brackish environments. Its fibrous stems and leaves have historically been used to produce a type of silk-like material. Silene sericea var. littorea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
