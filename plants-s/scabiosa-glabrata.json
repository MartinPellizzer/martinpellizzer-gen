    "intro": "Scabiosa glabrata, commonly known as the smooth scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa glabrata is also valued for its nectar-rich flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
