    "intro": "Solanum horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features sprawling, trailing stems that often grow along the ground, reaching lengths of up to several meters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple, followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
