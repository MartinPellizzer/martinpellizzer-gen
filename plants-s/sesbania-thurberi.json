    "intro": "Sesbania thurberi, commonly known as the thurber's sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided, and its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Sesbania thurberi is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enhances soil fertility."
