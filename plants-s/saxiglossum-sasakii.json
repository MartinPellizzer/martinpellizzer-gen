    "intro": "Saxiglossum sasakii, commonly known as the Hawaiian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Saxiglossum sasakii is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is considered a rare and endangered species."
