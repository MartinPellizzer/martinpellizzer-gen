    "intro": "Senecio marceris, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Senecio marceris is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
