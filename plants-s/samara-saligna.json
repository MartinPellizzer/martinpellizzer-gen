    "intro": "Samara saligna, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged seeds called samaras, which are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and silvery-gray, which gives it its common name. Samara saligna is often found near water sources and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
