    "intro": "Salvia grossheimii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill sage, is a perennial herb native to California and parts of Nevada. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces vibrant violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Salvia grossheimii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
