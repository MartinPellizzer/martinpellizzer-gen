It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils, often found in fields and along roadsides. Its flowers are small and usually purple or white, and the leaves are ovate with a rough texture.
