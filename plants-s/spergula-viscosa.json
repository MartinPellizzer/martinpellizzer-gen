    "intro": "Spergula viscosa, commonly known as sticky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Spergula viscosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
