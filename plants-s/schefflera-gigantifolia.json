    "intro": "Schefflera gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a striking tropical species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a dramatic, almost tree-like appearance. The plant has a robust, upright stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy texture. Schefflera gigantifolia is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
