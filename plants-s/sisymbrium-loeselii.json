    "intro": "Sisymbrium loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host, typically grasses or other herbaceous plants. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
