    "intro": "Serrafalcus mollissimus, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with large, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
