It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruit clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is adapted to wetland environments. Styrax suberifolius plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
