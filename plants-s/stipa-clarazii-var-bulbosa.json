It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a compact clump. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically adorned with pale to golden-colored flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to the landscape. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid environments."
