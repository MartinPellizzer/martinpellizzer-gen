    "intro": "Stelis concava, commonly known as the hollow stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hollow stems and small, clustered flowers that often bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. Stelis concava is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
