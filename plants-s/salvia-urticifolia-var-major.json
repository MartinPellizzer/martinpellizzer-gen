    "intro": "Salvia urticifolia var. major, commonly known as Mexican bush sage, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, slightly hairy texture and a distinctive minty aroma. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice in native plant gardens."
