    "intro": "Styrax pseudargyrophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. These flowers are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Styrax pseudargyrophyllus thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
