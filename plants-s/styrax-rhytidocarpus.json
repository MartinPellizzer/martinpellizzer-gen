It is characterized by its ovate to elliptic leaves that are often rough or pubescent to the touch. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by dark red, woody capsules. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Styrax rhytidocarpus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and floral display."
