    "intro": "Scolopendrium vulgare var. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are divided into small, serrated segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
