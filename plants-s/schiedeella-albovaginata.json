    "intro": "Schiedeella albovaginata, commonly known as the white-barked schiedeella, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive white, papery bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Schiedeella albovaginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low-maintenance in suitable climates."
