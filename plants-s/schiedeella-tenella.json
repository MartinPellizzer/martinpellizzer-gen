    "intro": "Schiedeella tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved schiedeella, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers in late spring or early summer, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is often found in heathlands and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Schiedeella tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
