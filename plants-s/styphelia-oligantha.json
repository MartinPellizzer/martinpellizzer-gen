    "intro": "Styphelia oligantha, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact form and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Styphelia oligantha thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal and heathland environments. It is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
