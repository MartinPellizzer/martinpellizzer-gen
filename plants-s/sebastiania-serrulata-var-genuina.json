It is characterized by its clusters of bright purple berries that persist through winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
