    "intro": "Sparganium erectum subsp. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping bur reed, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clusters with cylindrical, spiky inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it has a distinctive, spongy, brownish stem that is often used in traditional medicine. It spreads via stolons, allowing it to colonize wetland areas effectively. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
