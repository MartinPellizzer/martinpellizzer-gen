    "intro": "Silene cucubalus var. marginata, commonly known as the coastal bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, and the plant is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Silene cucubalus var. marginata is often found in dune habitats and is considered a hardy, drought-resistant species."
