    "intro": "Spermacoce malacophylla, commonly known as the hairy sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Spermacoce malacophylla is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
