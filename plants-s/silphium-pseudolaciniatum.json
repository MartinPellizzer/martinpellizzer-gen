    "intro": "Silphium pseudolaciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed silphium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in open woodland habitats. It is known for its historical use by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a rare and endangered species."
