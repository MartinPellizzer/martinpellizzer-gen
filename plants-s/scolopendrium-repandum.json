    "intro": "Scolopendrium repandum, commonly known as the running marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to the wetlands of North America. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. Scolopendrium repandum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
