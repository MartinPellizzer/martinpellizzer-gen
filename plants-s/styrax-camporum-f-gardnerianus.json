    "intro": "Styrax camporum f. gardnerianus, commonly known as the Gardner's styrax, is a variant of the fragrant styrax species native to the southeastern United States. This plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The flowers emit a sweet, resinous scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet, with a dense, rounded form. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and the plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
