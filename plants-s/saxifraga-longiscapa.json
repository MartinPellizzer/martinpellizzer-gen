    "intro": "Saxifraga longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga longiscapa is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
