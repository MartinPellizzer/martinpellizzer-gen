It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, hairy stems that are often prostrate or ascending. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. Small white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
