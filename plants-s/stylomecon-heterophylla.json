It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its rapid growth and twining habit. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are variable in shape, often appearing heart-shaped or ovate, which contributes to its common name.
