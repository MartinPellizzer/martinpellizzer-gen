    "intro": "Selinum lactescens, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Selinum lactescens is adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals and humans."
