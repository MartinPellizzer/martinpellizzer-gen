These plants are native to various regions of Africa, particularly in the savannas and grasslands. They are characterized by their slender, often branched stems and clusters of small, fluffy flowers that resemble cotton or broom. The leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Symbolanthus species are often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as forage for livestock."
