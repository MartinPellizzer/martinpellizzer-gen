    "intro": "Selliguea ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant's leaves are usually small, oval, and have a distinctive horn-like structure on the underside, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots and relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Selliguea ceratophylla is often found in temperate regions and is a characteristic species of humid, shaded habitats."
