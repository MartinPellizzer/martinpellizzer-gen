    "intro": "Sedum kirilowii, commonly known as the Kirilow's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to eastern Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum kirilowii is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
