It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, ragweeds, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender stem and small, yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. Stilpnopappus patulus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
