    "intro": "Salix martiana, commonly known as the red-osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive bright red stems, which are especially prominent in the winter months. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by white to pinkish flowers. Its leaves are elliptical with finely toothed margins and turn yellow in the fall. Salix martiana is often found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands."
