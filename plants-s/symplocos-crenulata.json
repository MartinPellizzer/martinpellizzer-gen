    "intro": "Symplocos crenulata, commonly known as the serrated wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark blue berries in the fall. Symplocos crenulata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitat."
