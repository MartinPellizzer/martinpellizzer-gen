    "intro": "Salix brachycarpa var. mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive zigzag pattern along the edges. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
