    "intro": "Stipa badachschanica subsp. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes and meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. This subspecies is adapted to cold, arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
