    "intro": "Salix fusca, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to waterlogged soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for certain bird species. Salix fusca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife."
