    "intro": "Schoenus pallescens, commonly known as the pale grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often pale green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Schoenus pallescens is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
