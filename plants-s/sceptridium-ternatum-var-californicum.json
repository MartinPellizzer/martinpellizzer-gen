    "intro": "Sceptridium ternatum var. californicum, commonly known as the California clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which are typical of clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
