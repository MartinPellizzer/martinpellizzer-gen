    "intro": "Sorghastrum albescens, commonly known as the whitegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that appear in summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Sorghastrum albescens is often found in wetter habitats compared to other grasses in its genus."
