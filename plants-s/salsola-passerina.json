    "intro": "Salsola passerina, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is an annual or biennial plant characterized by its spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. Native to Eurasia, it has become naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. The plant is adapted to arid and disturbed environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal make it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
