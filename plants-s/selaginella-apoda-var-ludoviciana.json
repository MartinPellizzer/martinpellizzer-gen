It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or rocky crevices. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its unique morphology and ability to tolerate low light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Selaginella apoda var. ludoviciana is also noted for its ability to survive in arid conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience."
