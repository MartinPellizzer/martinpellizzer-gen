    "intro": "Sclerocactus johnsonii subsp. acunensis, commonly known as Johnson's spiny cactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its compact, rounded stem and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise green structure. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
