    "intro": "Swida interior, commonly known as the interior swida, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
