    "intro": "Sophronitis brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Sophronitis brevicaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled greenhouse setting."
