It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with striking red veins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. It is cultivated for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides.
