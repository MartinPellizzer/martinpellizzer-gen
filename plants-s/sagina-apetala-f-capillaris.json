    "intro": "Sagina apetala f. capillaris, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, prostrate growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. This frost-tolerant species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
