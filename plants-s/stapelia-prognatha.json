    "intro": "Stapelia prognatha, commonly known as the Cape clawveld stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often spiny stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Stapelia prognatha is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
