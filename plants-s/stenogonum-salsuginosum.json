    "intro": "Stenogonum salsuginosum, commonly known as the salt marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red throat. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems. Stenogonum salsuginosum is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salinity, making it an important component of salt marsh vegetation."
