    "intro": "Stylidium vinosum, commonly known as the purple stickseed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, and the plant is known for its ability to produce a sticky substance from its glandular hairs. Stylidium vinosum is also notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are forcibly ejected from the capsule when mature."
