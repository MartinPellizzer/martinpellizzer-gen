    "intro": "Saxifraga aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces clusters of bright orange-red flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture. Saxifraga aurantiaca is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display and hardy nature."
