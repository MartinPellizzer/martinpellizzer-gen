    "intro": "Solanum hondelmannii, commonly known as the Hondelmann's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly found in Mexico and Guatemala, where it grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant typically features small, green leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and they contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
