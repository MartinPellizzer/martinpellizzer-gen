It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Scirpus burchellii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
