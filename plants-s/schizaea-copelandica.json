    "intro": "Schizaea copelandica, commonly known as the common whorltongue, is a member of the family Schizaeaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with whorled, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, stalked clusters along the leaf margins. Schizaea copelandica is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
