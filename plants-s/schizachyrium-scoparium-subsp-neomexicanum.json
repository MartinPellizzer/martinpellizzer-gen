    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium subsp. neomexicanum, commonly known as New Mexico sideblades, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and taller growth compared to the typical form of Schizachyrium scoparium."
