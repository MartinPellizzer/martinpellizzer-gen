It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, leaf-like bracts that encase its small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its morphology includes woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Staphidium chinantlanum is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
