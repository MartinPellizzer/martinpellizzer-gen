    "intro": "Sanicula montana, commonly known as mountain sanicle, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported tonic and antispasmodic properties. Sanicula montana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
