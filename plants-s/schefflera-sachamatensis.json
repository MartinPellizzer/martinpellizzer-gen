    "intro": "Schefflera sachamatensis, commonly known as the Bornean umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, palmate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Schefflera sachamatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
