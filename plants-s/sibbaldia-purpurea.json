    "intro": "Sibbaldia purpurea, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Sibbaldia purpurea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
