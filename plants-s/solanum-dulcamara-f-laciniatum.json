    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara f. laciniatum, commonly known as the climbing nightshade or fragrant woodbine, is a variant of the common woody nightshade. It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with lobed or toothed edges. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. These flowers give way to orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
