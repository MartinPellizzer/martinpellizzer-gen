    "intro": "Sapium ruizii, commonly known as Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. The tree is also valued for its wood, which is lightweight and used in various crafts and construction."
