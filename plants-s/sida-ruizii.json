    "intro": "Sida ruizii, commonly known as the Ruiz's mallow, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Sida ruizii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
