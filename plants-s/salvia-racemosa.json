    "intro": "Salvia racemosa, commonly known as blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia racemosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine."
