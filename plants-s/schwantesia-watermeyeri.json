    "intro": "Schwantesia watermeyeri, commonly known as the watermeyeri cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms, and has a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
