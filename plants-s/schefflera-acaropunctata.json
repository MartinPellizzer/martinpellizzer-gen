    "intro": "Schefflera acaropunctata, commonly known as the African net leaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged in a circular pattern at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera acaropunctata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
