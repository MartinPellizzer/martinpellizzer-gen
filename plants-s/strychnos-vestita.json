It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a thick, velvety coating. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Strychnos vestita is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
