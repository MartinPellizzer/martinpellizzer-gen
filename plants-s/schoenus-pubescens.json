    "intro": "Schoenus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
