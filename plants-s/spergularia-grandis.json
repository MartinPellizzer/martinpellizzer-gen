It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and salty environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Spergularia grandis is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
