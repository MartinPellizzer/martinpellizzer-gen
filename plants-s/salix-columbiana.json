    "intro": "Salix columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks, wet meadows, and riparian zones. The Columbia willow plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
