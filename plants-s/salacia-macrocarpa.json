    "intro": "Salacia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited salacia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Salacia macrocarpa is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles."
