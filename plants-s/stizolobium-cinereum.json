    "intro": "Stizolobium cinereum, commonly known as the gray acacia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, elongated pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Stizolobium cinereum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood in its native habitat."
