    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pendulina nothof. erythroflexuosa, commonly known as the red-flexed weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive, pendulous branches that create a cascading effect. It features finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are yellow-green and arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in wetland environments."
