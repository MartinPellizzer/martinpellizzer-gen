    "intro": "Stenostephanus luteynii, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
