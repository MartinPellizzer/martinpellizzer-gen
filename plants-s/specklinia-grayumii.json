    "intro": "Specklinia grayumii, commonly known as the gray's speckled orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers are small and often have a speckled or mottled appearance, giving it its common name. Specklinia grayumii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
