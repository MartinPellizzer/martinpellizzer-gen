    "intro": "Sorghum camporum, commonly known as the yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, elongated leaves that often display a yellowish-green hue. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green or brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Sorghum camporum is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
