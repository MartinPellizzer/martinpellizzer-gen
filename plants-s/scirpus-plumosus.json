    "intro": "Scirpus plumosus, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil in marshy areas. Scirpus plumosus is widely used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife."
