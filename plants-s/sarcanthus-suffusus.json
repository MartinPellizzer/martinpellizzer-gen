    "intro": "Sarcanthus suffusus, commonly known as the purple milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Sarcanthus suffusus plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
