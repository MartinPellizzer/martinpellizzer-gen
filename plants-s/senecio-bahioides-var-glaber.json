    "intro": "Senecio bahioides var. glaber, commonly known as the nakedleaf groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glabrous, or hairless. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
