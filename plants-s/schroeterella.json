    "intro": "Schroeterella, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. Schroeterella species are characterized by their hairy stems and leaves, and they often thrive in disturbed soils. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
