    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. insularis, commonly known as the island saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive red or purple spot at the base of each petal. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
