    "intro": "Symingtonia, commonly known as the \"Cape coral tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, coral-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink and purple. Symingtonia species are typically small shrubs or trees, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
