    "intro": "Staphylea ternata, commonly known as the three-lobed hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, nut-like fruits that mature in late summer. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy flower clusters. Staphylea ternata is often used in hedges and as a decorative plant in gardens due to its compact growth habit."
