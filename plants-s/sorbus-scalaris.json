    "intro": "Sorbus scalaris, commonly known as the mountain ash or whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a distinctive scalloped pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which give way to red or orange berries in the autumn. Sorbus scalaris is often found in rocky or woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
