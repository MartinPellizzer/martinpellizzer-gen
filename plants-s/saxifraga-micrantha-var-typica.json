    "intro": "Saxifraga micrantha var. typica, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
