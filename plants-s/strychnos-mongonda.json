    "intro": "Strychnos mongonda, commonly known as the African poison apple, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine. These toxins make it a potent poison, though the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine in limited forms. Its botanical features make it both a notable and dangerous species in its native habitat."
