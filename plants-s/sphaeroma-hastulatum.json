    "intro": "Sphaeroma hastulatum, commonly known as the horned sea snail, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Sphaeromatidae. It is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell with a distinct, pointed apex and a series of ridges and grooves along its surface. The shell is typically reddish-brown in color and can grow up to 5 centimeters in length. This marine gastropod is found in tropical and subtropical waters, often inhabiting rocky shores and tide pools. Its morphology is adapted for a life spent in the intertidal zone, where it feeds on algae and other organic matter."
