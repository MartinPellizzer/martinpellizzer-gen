    "intro": "Sphacele alpina, commonly known as the alpine sphacele, is a small, herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. The plant features a short, upright stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale pink in color. Sphacele alpina is adapted to harsh alpine environments, with a short growing season and a reliance on specific microclimates for survival."
