    "intro": "Scirpus junghuhnii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
