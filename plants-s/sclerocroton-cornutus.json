    "intro": "Sclerocroton cornutus, commonly known as the horned croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management due to its potential invasiveness."
