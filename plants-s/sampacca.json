    "intro": "Sampacca, commonly known as the common nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and thrives in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, followed by berries that change color from green to red as they mature. Sampacca is known for its toxic properties, particularly in its berries, which contain solanine and other alkaloids. Despite its toxicity, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of poison in some cultures."
