    "intro": "Sarcocornia littorea, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, including salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or white, and it produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. Sarcocornia littorea plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
