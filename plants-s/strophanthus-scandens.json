    "intro": "Strophanthus scandens, commonly known as the climbing arrowroot, is a tropical vine native to Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots and leaves contain cardiotonic compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption without proper expertise."
