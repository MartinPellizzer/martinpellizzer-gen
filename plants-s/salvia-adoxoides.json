    "intro": "Salvia adoxoides, commonly known as the Mexican sage or blue sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia adoxoides is also valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
