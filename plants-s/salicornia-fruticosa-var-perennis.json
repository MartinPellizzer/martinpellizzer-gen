    "intro": "Salicornia fruticosa var. perennis, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. This plant thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its flowering stems produce tiny, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Salicornia fruticosa var. perennis is an important species for both ecological and potential commercial uses, including as a source of natural salts and bioactive compounds."
