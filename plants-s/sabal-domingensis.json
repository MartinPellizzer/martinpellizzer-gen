It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown surface and can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant has pinnate leaves that are divided into long, narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces yellow-orange fruits that are edible. Sabal domingensis is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
