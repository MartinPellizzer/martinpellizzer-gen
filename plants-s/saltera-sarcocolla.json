    "intro": "Saltera sarcocolla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Saltera sarcocolla is considered endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
