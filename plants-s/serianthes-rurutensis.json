    "intro": "Serianthes rurutensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, woody structure, which provides habitat for various native birds and insects. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for centuries, making it a significant component of Hawaii's native forests. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Serianthes rurutensis is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
