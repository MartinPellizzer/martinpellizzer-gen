It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Sabulina stricta is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in cold climates with limited nutrients."
