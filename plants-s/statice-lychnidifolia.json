    "intro": "Statice lychnidifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its showy, pink to purple florets that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice lychnidifolia is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in floral arrangements and as a garden plant."
