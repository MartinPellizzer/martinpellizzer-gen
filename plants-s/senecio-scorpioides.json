    "intro": "Senecio scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion weed, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
