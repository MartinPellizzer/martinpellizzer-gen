    "intro": "Scopolina hladnikiana, commonly known as the Hladnik's scopolia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its foliage consists of ovate, hairy leaves, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the toxic alkaloids responsible for its medicinal and hallucinogenic properties. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Scopolina hladnikiana is considered an endangered species in its native range."
