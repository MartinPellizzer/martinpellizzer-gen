    "intro": "Symphyotrichum novi-belgii var. litoreum, commonly known as coastal aster, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
