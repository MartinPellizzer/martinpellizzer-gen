    "intro": "Styrax sieberi, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy appearance. Styrax sieberi thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
