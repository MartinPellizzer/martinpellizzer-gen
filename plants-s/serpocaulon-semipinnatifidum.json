    "intro": "Serpocaulon semipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed serpocaulon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often described as semipinnatifid, meaning they are divided into narrow, thread-like segments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Serpocaulon semipinnatifidum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
