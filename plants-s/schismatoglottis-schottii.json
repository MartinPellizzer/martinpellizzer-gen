    "intro": "Schismatoglottis schottii, commonly known as the Schott's schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to parts of tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically emerging from the base of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
