    "intro": "Smilax flaccida, commonly known as the weak-stemmed catbriar, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features thin, wiry stems that can twine around supports, and its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Smilax flaccida is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species within the Smilacaceae family."
