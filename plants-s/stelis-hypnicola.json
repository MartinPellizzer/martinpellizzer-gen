    "intro": "Stelis hypnicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocky substrates and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in crevices and absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. Its leaves are narrow and often clustered at the base, contributing to its compact appearance. Stelis hypnicola is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions typical of tropical and subtropical forests."
