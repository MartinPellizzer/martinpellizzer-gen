It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive musky scent. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often forming dense mats in rocky crevices. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
