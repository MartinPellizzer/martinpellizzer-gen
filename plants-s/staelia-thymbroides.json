    "intro": "Staelia thymbroides, commonly known as the hairy leafed staelia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Its small, yellow flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Staelia thymbroides is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
