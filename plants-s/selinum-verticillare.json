It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in meadows and rocky soils. Selinum verticillare contains volatile oils and has been used historically for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
