    "intro": "Salvia albida, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Salvia albida is also valued for its aromatic properties and traditional use in various cultural practices."
