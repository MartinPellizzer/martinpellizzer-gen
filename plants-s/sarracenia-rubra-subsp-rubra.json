    "intro": "Sarracenia rubra subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red sunset pitcher plant, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Sarracenia rubra subsp. rubra is a popular horticultural plant due to its ornamental value and unique trapping mechanism."
