    "intro": "Schoenolirion bracteosum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive blue or purple hue. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Schoenolirion bracteosum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
