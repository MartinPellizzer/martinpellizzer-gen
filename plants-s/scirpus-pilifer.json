    "intro": "Scirpus pilifer, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Scirpus pilifer plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
