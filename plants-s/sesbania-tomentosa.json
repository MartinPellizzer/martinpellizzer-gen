    "intro": "Sesbania tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy sesbania, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow, pod-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Sesbania tomentosa is adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas, making it a pioneer species in ecological succession. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which improves soil fertility."
