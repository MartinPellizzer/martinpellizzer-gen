    "intro": "Salix breviserrata subsp. fontqueri, commonly known as the Sierra willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrations that are shorter and more rounded than those of the typical Salix breviserrata. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along streams. Its growth habit makes it an important species for stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
