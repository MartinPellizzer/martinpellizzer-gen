    "intro": "Sponia glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sponia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Sponia glabrescens is notable for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds used in traditional herbal remedies. Its growth habit is generally low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat."
