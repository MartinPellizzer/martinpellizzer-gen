    "intro": "Solanum morella subsp. nigrum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or purple, followed by berries that mature to a deep black color. These berries are toxic to humans and animals but are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
