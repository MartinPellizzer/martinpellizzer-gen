    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 wichurae, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its weeping habit and long, drooping branches. It is native to the eastern United States and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. The tree is relatively fast-growing and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a prominent feature in wetland ecosystems."
