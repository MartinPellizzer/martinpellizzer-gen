    "intro": "Solanum aculeastrum, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm climates. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
