    "intro": "Syzygium travancoricum, commonly known as the Travancore sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
