    "intro": "Sorema glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky sorema, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The resinous properties of Sorema glutinosa have made it valuable in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
