    "intro": "Spermacoce lineata, commonly known as the slender false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, two-lobed, indehiscent fruits called carpospores. Spermacoce lineata thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
