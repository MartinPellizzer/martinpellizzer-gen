    "intro": "Stoebe microcephala, commonly known as dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its compact size and ability to colonize harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
