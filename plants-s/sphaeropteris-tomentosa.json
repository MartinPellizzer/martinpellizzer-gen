    "intro": "Sphaeropteris tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy tissue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
