It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenoplectus hondoensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
