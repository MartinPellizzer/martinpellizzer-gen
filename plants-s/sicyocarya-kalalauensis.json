    "intro": "Sicyocarya kalalauensis, commonly known as the Kalalau daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as sandy beaches and rocky shores, where it thrives in well-drained soil. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
