    "intro": "Salvia crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and striking spikes of violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid landscapes. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Salvia crassifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
