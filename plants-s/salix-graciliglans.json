    "intro": "Salix graciliglans, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and finely textured, silvery-gray leaves that shimmer in the wind. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
