    "intro": "Salix issykiensis, commonly known as the Issyk-Kul willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly around Lake Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has slender, flexible branches and produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture and a silvery underside. Salix issykiensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native habitat."
