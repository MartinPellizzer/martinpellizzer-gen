    "intro": "Solanum robustum var. laxepilosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for cultivation or consumption."
