    "intro": "Styphelia densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are dense, leathery, and evergreen, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its sandy, acidic soil habitat. Styphelia densifolia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
