    "intro": "Sida hirsutissima, commonly known as desert cotton or wooly mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Sida hirsutissima is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
