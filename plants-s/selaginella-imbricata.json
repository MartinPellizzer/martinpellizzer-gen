    "intro": "Selaginella imbricata, commonly known as the stair-step spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often arranged in a stair-step pattern, giving it its common name. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized leaves called sporophylls, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Selaginella imbricata is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in temperate and subtropical regions."
