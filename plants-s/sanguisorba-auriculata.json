    "intro": "Sanguisorba auriculata, commonly known as red root or auriculate sanguisorba, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with toothed edges and a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base on the lower leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Sanguisorba auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
