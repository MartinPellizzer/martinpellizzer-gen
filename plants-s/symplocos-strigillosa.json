    "intro": "Symplocos strigillosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, dark red berries in the fall. Its growth habit is typically upright and compact, making it suitable for small garden spaces. Symplocos strigillosa is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and streambanks."
