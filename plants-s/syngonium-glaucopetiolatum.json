It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a mix of green and silver, with a glossy texture. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the stems. Its stems are covered in small, hairy nodes that aid in climbing. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular houseplant."
