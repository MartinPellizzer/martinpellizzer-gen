    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 adamii, commonly known as the hybrid needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a hybrid between Stipa capillata and Stipa purpurea, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, tufted clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Stipa \u00d7 adamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance and drought tolerance."
