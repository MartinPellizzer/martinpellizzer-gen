    "intro": "Sonchus glaucescens subsp. giganteus, commonly known as giant sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, silver-green leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It grows up to 1.5 meters tall, making it a striking addition to wildflower gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
