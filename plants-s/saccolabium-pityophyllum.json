    "intro": "Saccolabium pityophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockheath, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with a narrow, linear shape, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces pods that contain small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Saccolabium pityophyllum is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is well-suited to withstand drought conditions."
