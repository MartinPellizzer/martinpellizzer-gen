    "intro": "Symphyotrichum plumosum, commonly known as the silky goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, golden-yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces feathery, bracted involucres that give it a delicate, airy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in moist meadows and open woodlands. Silky goldenrod is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
