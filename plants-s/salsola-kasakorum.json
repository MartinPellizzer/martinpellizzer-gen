    "intro": "Salsola kasakorum, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or alkaline soils, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with spiny stems and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in many areas. Salsola kasakorum is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and widespread species in dry landscapes."
