The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers followed by berries. This subspecies is valued not only for its culinary use but also for its potential in agricultural biodiversity and adaptation to extreme environments."
