    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella triangulata var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its triangular stems and reduced bracts, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. This variety is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is an important part of wetland ecosystems."
