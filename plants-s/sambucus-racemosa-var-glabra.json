    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. glabra, commonly known as smooth elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and in woodlands. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed."
