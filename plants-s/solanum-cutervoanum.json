It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves.

Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
