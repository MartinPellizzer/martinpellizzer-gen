    "intro": "Struthiola littoralis, commonly known as the coastal struthiola, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions. Struthiola littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
