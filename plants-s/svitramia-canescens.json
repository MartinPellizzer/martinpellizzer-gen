    "intro": "Svitramia canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it to conserve water. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Svitramia canescens is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
