    "intro": "Sorbus remensis, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and dark green, leathery leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by white to pink berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Sorbus remensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
