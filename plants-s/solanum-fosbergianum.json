It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, and it bears berries that are toxic to humans and animals.

The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
