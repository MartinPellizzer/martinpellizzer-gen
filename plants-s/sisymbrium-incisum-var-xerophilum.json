    "intro": "Sisymbrium incisum var. xerophilum, commonly known as the desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lobed, adapted to minimize transpiration in dry environments. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
