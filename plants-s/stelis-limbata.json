    "intro": "Stelis limbata, commonly known as the orchid butterfly. It is a species of orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of butterflies, hence its common name."
