    "intro": "Sphacanthus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
