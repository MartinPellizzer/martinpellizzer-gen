    "intro": "Solanum tampicense, commonly known as the Florida nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces small, purple to violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Despite its toxicity, it plays an important ecological role in its native environment."
