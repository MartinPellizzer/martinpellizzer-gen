    "intro": "Stellilabium smaragdinum, commonly known as the emerald star-lip, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant green leaves and clusters of star-shaped, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique floral structure with elongated, labiate petals that resemble small stars, giving it its common name. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Stellilabium smaragdinum is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem."
