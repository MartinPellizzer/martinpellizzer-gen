    "intro": "Smilax modesta, commonly known as the small-stemmed greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and thorny growth habit, which help it to climb and entangle other plants. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Smilax modesta is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
