    "intro": "Saxifraga serpyllifolia var. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
