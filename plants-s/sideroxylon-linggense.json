    "intro": "Sideroxylon linggense, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
