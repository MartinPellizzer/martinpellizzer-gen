    "intro": "Sporobolus virginicus var. littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal dune ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines."
