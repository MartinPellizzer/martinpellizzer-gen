    "intro": "Stipa capillata, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa capillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
