It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Senna insularis is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it an important species in local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
