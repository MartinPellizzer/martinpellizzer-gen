    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis var. globularis, commonly known as the globular bloodwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more reduced. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported hemostatic properties. The species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
