    "intro": "Stelis bella, commonly known as the beauty orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis bella is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
