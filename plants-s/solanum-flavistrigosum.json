    "intro": "Solanum flavistrigosum, commonly known as the yellow-haired nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its toxic compounds, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
