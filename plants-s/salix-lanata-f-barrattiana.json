    "intro": "Salix lanata f. barrattiana, commonly known as the Barratt's willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
