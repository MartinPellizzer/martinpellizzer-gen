    "intro": "Sagina humifusa, commonly known as common carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist, disturbed soils. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval to elliptic, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sagina humifusa is often found in lawns, along pathways, and in wet meadows, where it thrives in humid conditions."
