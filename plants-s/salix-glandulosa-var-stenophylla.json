    "intro": "Salix glandulosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid and semi-arid environments."
