    "intro": "Sericocarpus californicus, commonly known as the California lousewort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits called sericocarps, which are covered in a fine, silken coating. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and adaptation to arid environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
