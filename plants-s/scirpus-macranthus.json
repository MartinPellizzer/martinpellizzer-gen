    "intro": "Scirpus macranthus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a dominant vegetation in freshwater marshes and wetlands. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stalks, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the structural stability of wetland ecosystems. Scirpus macranthus plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
