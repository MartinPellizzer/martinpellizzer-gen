    "intro": "Senecio rosellatus, commonly known as the Rosella's groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
