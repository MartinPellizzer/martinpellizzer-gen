    "intro": "Siphonodon celastrineus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leafed siphonodon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically smooth and glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
