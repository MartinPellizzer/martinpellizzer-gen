    "intro": "Schefflera sciodaphyllum, commonly known as the shaded schefflera, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that provide a lush, foliage-heavy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Schefflera sciodaphyllum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its adaptability to low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental landscaping."
