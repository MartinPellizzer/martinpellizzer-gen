    "intro": "Salix karelinii, commonly known as the Karelin's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix karelinii is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds in its native range."
