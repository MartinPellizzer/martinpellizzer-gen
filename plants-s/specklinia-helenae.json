    "intro": "Specklinia helenae, commonly known as the Helen's speckled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds with a distinctive speckled appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its small, clustered rhizomes help it anchor to its substrate while supporting its aerial growth. Specklinia helenae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest canopies where it receives indirect light."
