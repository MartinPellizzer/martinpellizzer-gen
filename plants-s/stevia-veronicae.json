The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with small white or greenish flowers appearing in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Stevia veronicae is valued for its intense sweetness and is widely used as a natural alternative to sugar."
