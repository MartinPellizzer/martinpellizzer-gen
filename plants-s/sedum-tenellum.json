    "intro": "Sedum tenellum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is highly adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil conditions. Sedum tenellum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
