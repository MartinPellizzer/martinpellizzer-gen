It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pale underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist soils."
