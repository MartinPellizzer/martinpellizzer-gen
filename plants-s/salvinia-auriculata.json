    "intro": "Salvinia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes anchor it to submerged surfaces, while its floating leaves help in photosynthesis. Salvinia auriculata is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense vegetation in ponds and lakes."
