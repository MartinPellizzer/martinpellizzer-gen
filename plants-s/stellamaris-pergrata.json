    "intro": "Stellamaris pergrata, commonly known as the silver starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and beetles. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Stellamaris pergrata is considered an endangered species."
