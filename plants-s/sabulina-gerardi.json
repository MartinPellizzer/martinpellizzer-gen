    "intro": "Sabulina gerardi, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous and arid regions. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its ability to grow in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Sabulina gerardi plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations."
