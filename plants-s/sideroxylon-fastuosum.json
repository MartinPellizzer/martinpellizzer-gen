    "intro": "Sideroxylon fastuosum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow and are clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule containing several seeds. The species is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
