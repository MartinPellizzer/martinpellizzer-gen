    "intro": "Sorbus turbinata, commonly known as the Turban Apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, turbinate (helmet-shaped) fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its fruit is often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Sorbus turbinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh alpine environments."
