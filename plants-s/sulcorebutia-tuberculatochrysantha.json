It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in tubercles, which are small, rounded growths. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a compact, low-growing structure. Sulcorebutia tuberculatochrysantha is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
