    "intro": "Symplocos salix, commonly known as silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged fruits called samaras. Symplocos salix thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
