    "intro": "Specklinia retusa, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to trees or other surfaces, and its leaves are typically light green with a silvery sheen. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Specklinia retusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
