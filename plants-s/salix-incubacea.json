    "intro": "Salix incubacea, commonly known as the incubating willow, is a rare and delicate species of willow native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, silvery underside that reflects light in a unique way. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Salix incubacea is considered a vulnerable species."
