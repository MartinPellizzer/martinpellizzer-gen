    "intro": "Saxifraga rosacea, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of pink or rose-colored flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in mountain meadows. Saxifraga rosacea is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and intense sunlight."
