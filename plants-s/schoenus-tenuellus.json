It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
