It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
