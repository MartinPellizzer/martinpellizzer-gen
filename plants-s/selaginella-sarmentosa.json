    "intro": "Selaginella sarmentosa, commonly known as the wandering spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, thread-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, which often root at the nodes. Selaginella sarmentosa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
