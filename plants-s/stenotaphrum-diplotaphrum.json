    "intro": "Stenotaphrum diplotaphrum, commonly known as Florida grass or St. Augustine grass, is a warm-season perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and grows in dense, low tufts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by three-sided, dark brown seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form a thick, uniform turf."
