    "intro": "Selago holubii, commonly known as the holub\u2019s selago, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. Selago holubii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
