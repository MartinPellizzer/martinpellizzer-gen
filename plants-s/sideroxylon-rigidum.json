    "intro": "Sideroxylon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Sideroxylon rigidum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
