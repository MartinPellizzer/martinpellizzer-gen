    "intro": "Syncarpia laurifolia, commonly known as the satinwood or broad-leaved satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Syncarpia laurifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
