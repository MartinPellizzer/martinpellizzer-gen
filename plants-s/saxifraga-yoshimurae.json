    "intro": "Saxifraga yoshimurae, commonly known as Yoshimura's saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing pink or white petals that are adapted to attract pollinators in its alpine environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
