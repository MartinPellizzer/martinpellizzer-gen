    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei, commonly known as the stonecrop or fortune's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Saxifraga fortunei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
