    "intro": "Spiraea canescens var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the silver-leaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of white flowers. It features finely cut, ovate to oblanceolate leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its elegant, cascading form. This variety is relatively low maintenance and resistant to most pests and diseases."
