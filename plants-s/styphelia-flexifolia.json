    "intro": "Styphelia flexifolia, commonly known as the variable wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or sandy habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters and blooming during the cooler months. Styphelia flexifolia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and well-drained soils."
