    "intro": "Sphaeranthus talbotii, commonly known as Talbot's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are arranged in clusters, often resembling globes, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a compact growth habit. Sphaeranthus talbotii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its drought tolerance."
