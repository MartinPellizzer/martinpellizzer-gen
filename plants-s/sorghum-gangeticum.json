    "intro": "Sorghum gangeticum, commonly known as kaffir corn, is a tall, annual grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It produces large, spike-like inflorescences with bract-like leaves that enclose the flowering structures. The plant is characterized by its robust stalks and is known for its high yield of starchy grains, which are used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. The botanical features of Sorghum gangeticum make it a versatile and economically important crop in many parts of the world."
