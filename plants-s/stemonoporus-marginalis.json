It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
