    "intro": "Solanum photeinocarpum var. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-fruited nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking violet-colored berries. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit ripens to a deep violet hue. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
