    "intro": "Sorbus eugenii-kelleri, commonly known as the Kashmir Himalayan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, persistent berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
