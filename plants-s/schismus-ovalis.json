It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with latex-producing properties. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Schismus ovalis is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in disturbed areas."
