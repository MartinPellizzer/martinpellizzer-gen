    "intro": "Smilax elliptica, commonly known as the arrowleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that are armed with sharp, curved spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are arrow-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface and a distinct vein pattern. Smilax elliptica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
