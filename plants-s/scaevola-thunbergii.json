    "intro": "Scaevola thunbergii, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the early morning. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in sandy or saline soils. It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is often found along shorelines and in coastal gardens. Scaevola thunbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
