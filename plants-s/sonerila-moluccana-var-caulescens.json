    "intro": "Sonerila moluccana var. caulescens, commonly known as the Moluccan sonerila, is a flowering plant native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
