It produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its compact form makes it suitable for small gardens or as a hedge."
