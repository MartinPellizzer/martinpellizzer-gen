    "intro": "Sarcochilus incurvicalcar, commonly known as the curved spur sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spurred lip that is often curved, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dense, shaded understorey environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a prominent, often reddish, spur. Sarcochilus incurvicalcar is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival in the wild."
