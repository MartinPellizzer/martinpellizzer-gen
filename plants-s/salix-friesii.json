    "intro": "Salix friesii, commonly known as the Fries' willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in the early spring. Salix friesii is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing shelter and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
