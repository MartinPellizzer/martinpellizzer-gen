    "intro": "Sorghum caffrorum var. bicarinatum, commonly known as the African millet, is a drought-tolerant grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains. The plant thrives in poor soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the plant is often used for forage or as a traditional food source. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other sorghum species."
