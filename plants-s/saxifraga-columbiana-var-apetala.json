    "intro": "Saxifraga columbiana var. apetala, commonly known as the Columbia saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late spring. Its flowers are usually less showy compared to other saxifrage species, hence the variety name \"apetala,\" which refers to the reduced petals. This plant is well adapted to cool, humid climates and is often found in areas with high rainfall."
