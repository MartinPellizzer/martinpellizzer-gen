    "intro": "Symphyllia siletiana var. trichantha, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, trichotomous leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology includes small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
