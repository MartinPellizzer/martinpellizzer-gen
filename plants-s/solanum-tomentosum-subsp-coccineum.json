    "intro": "Solanum tomentosum subsp. coccineum, commonly known as the red-tomentose nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
