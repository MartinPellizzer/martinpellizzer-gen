    "intro": "Stelis consors, commonly known as the orchid mantling, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Stelis consors is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
