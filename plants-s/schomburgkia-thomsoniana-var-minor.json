    "intro": "Schomburgkia thomsoniana var. minor, commonly known as the Thomson's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically feature a vibrant mix of purple and yellow hues. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural environment."
