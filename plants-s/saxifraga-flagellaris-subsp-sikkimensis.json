The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive, serrated edge. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountain ecosystems."
