    "intro": "Solanum riparium, commonly known as water pepper, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of streams and ponds. The plant has small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellowish-green and appear in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Solanum riparium is part of the nightshade family and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
