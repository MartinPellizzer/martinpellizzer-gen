    "intro": "Silene gallica var. gomeraea, commonly known as the Gomera catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are often visited by insects such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
