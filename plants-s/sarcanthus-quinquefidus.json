    "intro": "Sarcanthus quinquefidus, commonly known as the five-ribbed sarcanthus, is a lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a glossy surface, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sarcanthus quinquefidus is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
