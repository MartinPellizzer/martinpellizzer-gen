    "intro": "Senecio jacalensis, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Senecio jacalensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
