    "intro": "Sida pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblan sida, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Sida pueblensis typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
