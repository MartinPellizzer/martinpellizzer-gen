    "intro": "Scabiosa maritima var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, dandelion-like yellow flower heads surrounded by white, papery bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. It is a hardy perennial that blooms from late spring to early summer."
