    "intro": "Sedum luteoviride, commonly known as the yellow-green stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique coloration and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
