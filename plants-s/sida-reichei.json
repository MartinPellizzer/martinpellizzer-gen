    "intro": "Sida reichei, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to poor soil conditions. Sida reichei is also known for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
