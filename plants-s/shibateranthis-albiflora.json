    "intro": "Shibateranthis albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered shibateranthis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their ornamental value. The plant features small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
