    "intro": "Sibbaldia potentilloides, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Sibbaldia potentilloides plays an important ecological role by providing food for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its fragile ecosystems."
