    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum var. pitiquilla, commonly known as the pitiquilla nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally not cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
