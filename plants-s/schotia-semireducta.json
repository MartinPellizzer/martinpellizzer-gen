    "intro": "Schotia semireducta, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unusual appearance, featuring a gnarled trunk and a dense crown of small, silvery-gray leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Schotia semireducta is also notable for its ability to produce a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested."
