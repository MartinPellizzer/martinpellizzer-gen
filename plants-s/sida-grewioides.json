    "intro": "Sida grewioides, commonly known as the woolly sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. Sida grewioides thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
