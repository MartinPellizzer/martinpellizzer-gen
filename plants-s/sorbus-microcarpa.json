    "intro": "Sorbus microcarpa, commonly known as the mountain whitebeam, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, including parts of California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sorbus microcarpa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
