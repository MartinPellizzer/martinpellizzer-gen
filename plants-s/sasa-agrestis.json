    "intro": "Sasa agrestis, commonly known as rough bamboo, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its stiff, hollow stems that grow in dense clumps. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. Sasa agrestis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thickets, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
