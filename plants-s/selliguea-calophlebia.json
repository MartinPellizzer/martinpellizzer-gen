    "intro": "Selliguea calophlebia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort found in moist, rocky habitats. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense mats. The plant typically grows on shaded rock surfaces or in crevices, where it thrives in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, called sorocarps, are borne on stalks and contain spores for propagation. Selliguea calophlebia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem."
