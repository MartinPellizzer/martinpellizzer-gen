It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
