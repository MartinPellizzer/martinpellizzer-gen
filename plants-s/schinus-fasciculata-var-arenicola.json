    "intro": "Schinus fasciculata var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand burr tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically clustered in fascicles. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a hard, spiky covering. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental features, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal landscapes."
