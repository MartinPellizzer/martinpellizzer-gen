    "intro": "Silene capitellata, commonly known as the clustered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster at the top of the stem. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Silene capitellata is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
