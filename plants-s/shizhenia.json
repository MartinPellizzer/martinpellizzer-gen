It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, which typically range in color from blue to purple. The plants are native to East Asia, particularly China, and thrive in temperate climates. Shizhenia species are often found in woodland areas and moist soils, where they form part of the understory vegetation. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries."
