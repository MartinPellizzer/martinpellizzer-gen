    "intro": "Sedum acre subsp. majus, commonly known as the Greater Stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance garden plant. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions, contributing to its ecological resilience."
