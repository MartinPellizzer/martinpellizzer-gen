    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea subf. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its greyish-white, tomentose (fuzzy) bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
