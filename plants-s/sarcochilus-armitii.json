    "intro": "Sarcochilus armitii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a unique fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Sarcochilus armitii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
