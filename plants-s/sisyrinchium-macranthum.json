    "intro": "Sisyrinchium macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typical of many grass species, and it often grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Sisyrinchium macranthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
