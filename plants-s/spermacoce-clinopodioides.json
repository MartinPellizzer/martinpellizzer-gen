It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
