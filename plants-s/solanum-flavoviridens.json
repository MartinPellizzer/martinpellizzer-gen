    "intro": "Solanum flavoviridens, commonly known as the yellow-green nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, yellow-green berries that mature in the fall. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and ovate leaves that are often tinged with yellow. It produces violet flowers that bloom in clusters, and the fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it contains toxic compounds in its raw state. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
