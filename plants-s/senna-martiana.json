    "intro": "Senna martiana, commonly known as the golden senna, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a spiny pod, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Senna martiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in some parts of the world for landscaping purposes."
