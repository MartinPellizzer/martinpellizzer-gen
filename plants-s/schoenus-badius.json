    "intro": "Schoenus badius, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. Schoenus badius plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
