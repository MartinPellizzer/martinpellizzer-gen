    "intro": "Salix balsamifera var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it typically flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
