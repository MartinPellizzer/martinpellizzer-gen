    "intro": "Struthiola holstii, commonly known as the Holst\u2019s struthiola, is a rare flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Struthiola holstii is considered a conservation concern."
