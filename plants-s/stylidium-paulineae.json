    "intro": "Stylidium paulineae, commonly known as the Pukapuka lily, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively on the island of Pukapuka in the Cook Islands. It belongs to the genus Stylidium, which is part of the family Haemodoraceae, commonly known as the flame grass family. The plant is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its small, tubular flowers are surrounded by leaf-like bracts, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that burst open to disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stylidium paulineae is considered a vulnerable species."
