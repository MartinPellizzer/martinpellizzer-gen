    "intro": "Strychnos jobertiana, commonly known as the Jobert's nux vomica, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Its bark and roots have been used traditionally in some cultures for their medicinal properties, though the plant is highly poisonous and should be handled with care."
