    "intro": "Sideritis arborescens f. densispicata, commonly known as the dense-spiked rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
