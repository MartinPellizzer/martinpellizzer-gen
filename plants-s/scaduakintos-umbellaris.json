    "intro": "Scaduakintos umbellaris, commonly known as the moonlight umbrella plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking white, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that blooms at night, emitting a subtle fragrance. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its scent and bioluminescent properties. Scaduakintos umbellaris is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
