    "intro": "Secale orientale, commonly known as the oriental ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
