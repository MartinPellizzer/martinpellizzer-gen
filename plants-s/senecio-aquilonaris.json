    "intro": "Senecio aquilonaris, commonly known as the Windhill groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio aquilonaris is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to cultivation in dry gardens."
