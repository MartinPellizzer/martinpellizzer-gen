    "intro": "Securidaca oblongifolia, commonly known as the African senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties."
