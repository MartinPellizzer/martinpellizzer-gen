It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in whorls. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy foliage and unique flowering pattern make it a distinctive member of the mint family."
