    "intro": "Soldanella affinis, commonly known as the slender sandcatcher, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically reaches a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Soldanella affinis is a member of the Primulaceae family and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
