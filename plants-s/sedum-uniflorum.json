    "intro": "Sedum uniflorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant has fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Sedum uniflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
