    "intro": "Selaginella lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant has the remarkable ability to survive extreme desiccation, curling into a compact, desiccated state when dry and reviving when exposed to moisture. Its structure consists of small, needle-like leaves and produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia. The plant's botanical significance lies in its ability to demonstrate extreme drought tolerance and its role in studying plant survival mechanisms."
