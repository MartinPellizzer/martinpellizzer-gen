    "intro": "Saxifraga congesta, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas where the climate is cold and the growing season is short. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, dense, and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Saxifraga congesta is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
