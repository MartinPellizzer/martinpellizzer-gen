    "intro": "Sorbus arvonicola, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
