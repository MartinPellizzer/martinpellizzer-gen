    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 alejandrei, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Saxifraga cespitosa and Saxifraga virgata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often dense and forms a low-growing mat, making it a popular choice for garden use in shady areas."
