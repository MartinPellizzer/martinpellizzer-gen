    "intro": "Styrax japurensis, commonly known as the Japurensis styrax, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
