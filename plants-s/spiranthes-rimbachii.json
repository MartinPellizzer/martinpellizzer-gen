    "intro": "Spiranthes rimbachii, commonly known as the pink spiraea, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many regions."
