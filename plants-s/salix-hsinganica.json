    "intro": "Salix hsinganica, commonly known as the Inner Mongolian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Salix hsinganica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
