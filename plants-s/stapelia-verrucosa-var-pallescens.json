It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically pale green to greyish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually yellowish-white, with a distinctive scent reminiscent of decaying meat.

Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular ornamental plant among succulent enthusiasts."
