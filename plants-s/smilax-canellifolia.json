    "intro": "Smilax canellifolia, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which are typically alternate and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright yellow berries that are edible for some wildlife. Smilax canellifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
