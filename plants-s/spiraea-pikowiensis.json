    "intro": "Spiraea pikowiensis, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, rounded foliage and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, upright stems with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more pronounced with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
