    "intro": "Salix dinsmorei, commonly known as Dinsmore's willow, is a rare shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
