    "intro": "Sedum hispidum, commonly known as the wooly sedum, is a perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum hispidum is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
