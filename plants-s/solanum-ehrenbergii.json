    "intro": "Solanum ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by small, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Solanum ehrenbergii is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its botanical features make it a resilient and distinctive member of the nightshade family."
