    "intro": "Scleranthus fasciculatus, commonly known as clustered sandspur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is well adapted to dry, sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a rough texture, while its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases tiny seeds. Scleranthus fasciculatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and invertebrates."
