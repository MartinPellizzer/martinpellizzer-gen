    "intro": "Santalum capense, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to South Africa. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its fragrance. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white or greenish in color. Santalum capense is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments."
