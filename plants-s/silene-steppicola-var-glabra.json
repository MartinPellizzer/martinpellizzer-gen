    "intro": "Silene steppicola var. glabra, commonly known as the steppe campion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has smooth, glabrous leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert-steppe ecosystems. Silene steppicola var. glabra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
