    "intro": "Stellilabium minutiflorum, commonly known as the star-labium dwarf flower, is a small, delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features tiny, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its scientific name. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
