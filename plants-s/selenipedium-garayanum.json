    "intro": "Selenipedium garayanum, commonly known as the giant spider-orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires high levels of light for optimal growth. Its inflorescence can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest orchids in the world. Selenipedium garayanum is also noted for its slow growth and long flowering cycle, which can span several years."
