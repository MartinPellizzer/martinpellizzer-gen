    "intro": "Saxifraga losae subsp. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
