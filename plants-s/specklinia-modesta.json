    "intro": "Specklinia modesta, commonly known as the modest speckled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with subtle speckling. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Specklinia modesta is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care in the right conditions."
