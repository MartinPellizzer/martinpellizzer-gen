It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain small, brown seeds used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
