    "intro": "Soranthe phylicoides, commonly known as the golden sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
