    "intro": "Senecio guascensis, commonly known as the Guascensis groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and exhibits a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are usually linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
