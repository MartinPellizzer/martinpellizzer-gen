It is native to the humid forests of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe. The plant is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, often with a striking contrast of colors. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silky hair.
