It features slender, opposite leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
