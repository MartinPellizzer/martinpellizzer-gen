    "intro": "Sporobolus borszczowii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, often covered with fine hairs that reduce water loss. Sporobolus borszczowii is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
