    "intro": "Spermolepis organensis, commonly known as the organensis dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of Organ in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are basal, lobed, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Spermolepis organensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for native insects."
