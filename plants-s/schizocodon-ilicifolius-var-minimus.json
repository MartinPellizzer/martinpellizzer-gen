    "intro": "Schizocodon ilicifolius var. minimus, commonly known as the small-leaved holly-leafed schizocodon, is a rare shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a compact appearance. Its flowers are typically small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
