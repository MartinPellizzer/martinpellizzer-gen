    "intro": "Steironema ciliatum var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
