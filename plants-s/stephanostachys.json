    "intro": "Stephanostachys, commonly known as the feather grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, arching stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give them a graceful appearance. Native to various regions in Africa and Asia, Stephanostachys species often thrive in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. They typically grow to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic appeal and ability to add texture to landscapes."
