    "intro": "Scurrula fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered scurrula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features wiry, branching stems covered in small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in green or reddish bracts, and are pollinated by insects. Scurrula fasciculata is known for its resilience to drought and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
