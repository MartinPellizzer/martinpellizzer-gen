    "intro": "Solanum symphyostemon, commonly known as the white eggplant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, egg-shaped, white or pale purple fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with simple, ovate leaves and showy, yellow flowers. Its fruit is edible when fully mature, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other solanaceous crops. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
