    "intro": "Spartina glabra var. pilosa, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a coastal grass species native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. This plant thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help filter water and reduce erosion. Spartina glabra var. pilosa is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to the ecological balance of tidal environments."
