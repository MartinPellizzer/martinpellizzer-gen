    "intro": "Sedum minimum subsp. minimum, commonly known as the miniature stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
