    "intro": "Stipa braun-blanquetii, commonly known as the Braun-Blanquet needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late summer, and it is adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Stipa braun-blanquetii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
