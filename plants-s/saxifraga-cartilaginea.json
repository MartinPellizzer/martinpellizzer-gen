    "intro": "Saxifraga cartilaginea, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a short inflorescence. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Saxifraga cartilaginea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats."
