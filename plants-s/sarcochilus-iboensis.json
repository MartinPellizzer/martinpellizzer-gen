    "intro": "Sarcochilus iboensis, commonly known as the Iboen's sarcochilus, is an epiphytic orchid native to New Guinea. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
