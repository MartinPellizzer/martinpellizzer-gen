    "intro": "Scaevola forbesii, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Scaevola forbesii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
