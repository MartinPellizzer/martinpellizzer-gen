    "intro": "Spiraea tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has slender, arching stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a soft, silvery down. Spiraea tibetica is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
