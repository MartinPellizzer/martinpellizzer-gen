    "intro": "Sisymbrium caeruleum, commonly known as blue mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dissemination. Sisymbrium caeruleum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
