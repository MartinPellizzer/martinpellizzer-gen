It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a spreading, decumbent growth habit with rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often form dense mats, while its flowers are small, clustered in spathaceous sheaths. Spatholirion decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
