    "intro": "Stapelia stricta, commonly known as the African milk plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Stapelia stricta is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
