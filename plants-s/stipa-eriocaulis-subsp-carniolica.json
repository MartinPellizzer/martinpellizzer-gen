    "intro": "Stipa eriocaulis subsp. carniolica, commonly known as the Carpathian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming low, compact clumps. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and panicles of small, spike-like flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
