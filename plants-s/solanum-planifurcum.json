    "intro": "Solanum planifurcum, commonly known as the flat-stemmed nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically features simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent and have a lanceolate shape. Its flowers are usually small, yellowish, and clustered in umbels, followed by berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution in handling."
