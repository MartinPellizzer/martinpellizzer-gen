    "intro": "Sobralia pleiantha, commonly known as the showy sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps retain moisture. Sobralia pleiantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
