    "intro": "Stomatium trifarium, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized structures for capturing prey. It possesses small, bladder-like organs called bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms. These bladders are inflated with air and are positioned to intercept passing prey. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its botanical features reflect adaptations for both aquatic life and carnivorous feeding."
