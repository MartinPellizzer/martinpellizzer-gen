    "intro": "Sonchus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a slender, branching stem that often grows in a cascading manner, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are covered in a layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a spherical shape, typical of the Asteraceae family. Sonchus pendulus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it can become invasive in some regions."
