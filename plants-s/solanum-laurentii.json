    "intro": "Solanum laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentii nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, followed by orange or red berries. It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy leaves, which help it adapt to arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
