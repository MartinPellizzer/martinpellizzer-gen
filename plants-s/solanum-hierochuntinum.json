    "intro": "Solanum hierochuntinum, commonly known as the Hierochunt Island nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hierochunt in the South China Sea. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
