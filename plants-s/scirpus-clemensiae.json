    "intro": "Scirpus clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which appear in late summer to early fall. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Scirpus clemensiae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
