    "intro": "Senegalia senegal var. rostrata, commonly known as the African acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are small and feathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, followed by long, slender pods that contain seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species for soil stabilization and traditional use in local communities. Its resilience and hardiness make it a valuable resource in ecological and agricultural contexts."
