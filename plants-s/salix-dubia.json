    "intro": "Salix dubia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. Salix dubia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
