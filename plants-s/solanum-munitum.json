    "intro": "Solanum munitum, commonly known as the alpine nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and livestock, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. Solanum munitum thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in meadows and rocky slopes."
