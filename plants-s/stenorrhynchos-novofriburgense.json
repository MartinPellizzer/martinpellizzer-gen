    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos novofriburgense, commonly known as the Friburg orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid cloud forests of southern Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, pseudobulbous structure and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. Its growth is slow, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
