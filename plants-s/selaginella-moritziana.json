    "intro": "Selaginella moritziana, commonly known as the Hart's tongue fern, is a small, evergreen plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery leaves that grow in a rosette formation. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Selaginella moritziana is also recognized for its resilience and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
