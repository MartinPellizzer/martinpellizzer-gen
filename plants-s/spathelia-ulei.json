    "intro": "Spathelia ulei, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a unique growth habit, often growing in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the acidic soil of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
