    "intro": "Siphocampylus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
