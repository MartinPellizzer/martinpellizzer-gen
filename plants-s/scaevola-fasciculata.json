    "intro": "Scaevola fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered fanflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that are clustered in whorls, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Scaevola fasciculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
