    "intro": "Stevia minor, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are highly aromatic. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Stevia minor is renowned for its leaves containing high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural, zero-calorie sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation."
