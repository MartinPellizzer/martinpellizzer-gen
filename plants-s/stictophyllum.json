    "intro": "Stictophyllum, commonly known as the liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood. Stictophyllum has a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the thallus. These plants play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms."
