    "intro": "Senecio tupungatoi, commonly known as the Tupungato Senecio, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in summer, are yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
