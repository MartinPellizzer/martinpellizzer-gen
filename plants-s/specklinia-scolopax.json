It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery or white vein pattern, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow, with a short spur, and bloom in late winter to early spring.
