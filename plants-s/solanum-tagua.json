    "intro": "Solanum tagua, commonly known as the tagua or the \"eggplant tree,\" is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that contain a single seed, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Solanum tagua is also valued for its hard, woody fruit, which can be used in traditional crafts and as a source of natural dyes. Its growth habits and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
