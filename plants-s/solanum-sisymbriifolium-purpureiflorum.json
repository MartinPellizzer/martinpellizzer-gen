It is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive bladder-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
