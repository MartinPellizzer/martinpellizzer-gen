    "intro": "Statice attenuata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like flower heads composed of numerous small, blue to purple blossoms. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and maritime environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a grayish-blue hue that helps reduce water loss. Statice attenuata is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in floral arrangements and garden landscapes."
