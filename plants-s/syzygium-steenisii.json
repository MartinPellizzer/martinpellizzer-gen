    "intro": "Syzygium steenisii, commonly known as the Bornean apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are yellow when ripe. Syzygium steenisii is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its potential use in traditional medicine."
