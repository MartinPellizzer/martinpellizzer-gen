    "intro": "Sidalcea hydrophila, commonly known as the water's edge checkerbloom, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near streams and wetlands, preferring partial to full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Sidalcea hydrophila plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in riparian habitats."
