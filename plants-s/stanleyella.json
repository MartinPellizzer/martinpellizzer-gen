    "intro": "Stanleyella, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually yellow or greenish in color. Stanleyella species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. They are adapted to harsh environments, often thriving in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water availability."
