    "intro": "Saguaster tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian saguaro, is a unique plant species native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous, woody stems. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are often modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in the arid conditions of its environment. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the North American saguaro cactus."
