It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that remain densely packed throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
