    "intro": "Scopolia sinensis, commonly known as Chinese bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to China. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves and produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Scopolia sinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its striking floral display. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
