    "intro": "Sphaerocionium ferrugineum var. donatii, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming during the cooler months. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This variant is distinguished by its rust-colored stems, which give it its scientific name."
