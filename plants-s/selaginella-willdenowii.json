    "intro": "Selaginella willdenowii, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce upright, spore-bearing cones at the tips. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella willdenowii is notable for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells."
