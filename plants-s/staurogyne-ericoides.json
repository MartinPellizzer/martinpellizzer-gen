It is a shrub that typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as mangrove swamps and estuaries. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive yellowish-green color. Staurogyne ericoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
