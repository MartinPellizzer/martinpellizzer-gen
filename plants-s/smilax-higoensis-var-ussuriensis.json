    "intro": "Smilax higoensis var. ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri arrowroot or Ussuri smilax, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny thorns, which help it climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
