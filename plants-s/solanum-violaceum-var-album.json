    "intro": "Solanum violaceum var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, round berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies."
