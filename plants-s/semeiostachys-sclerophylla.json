    "intro": "Semeiostachys sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically tough and leathery, a trait common in sclerophyllous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland and riparian ecosystems."
