    "intro": "Symplocos obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf evergreen holly, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. Symplocos obtusa thrives in acidic soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
