It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that often display a striking combination of colors. The plants typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stachygynandrum species are prized in horticulture for their ornamental value and unique floral scent. They require bright, indirect light and high humidity to thrive."
