It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is well adapted to humid, shaded environments. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps the plant store water, a trait typical of many succulents."
