    "intro": "Senecio leucanthemifolius subsp. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Groundsel, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features wiry, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its rapid growth and short flowering period, it is considered a short-lived species."
