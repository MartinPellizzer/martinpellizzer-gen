It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Sideritis vulcanica is known for its medicinal properties, with some species in the genus used traditionally for their calming and antispasmodic effects."
