    "intro": "Sisyrinchium micranthum subsp. valdivianum, commonly known as the Valdivian blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in the temperate regions of Chile and Argentina. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of S. micranthum."
