    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. fissa, commonly known as the purple willow with a split stem, is a variant of the purple willow native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-purple in color. The plant thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it forms dense stands. Its flowers appear in early spring, producing catkins that are an important food source for pollinators. The bark of Salix purpurea var. fissa is smooth and often peels in thin layers, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
