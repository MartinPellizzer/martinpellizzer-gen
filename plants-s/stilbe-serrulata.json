    "intro": "Stilbe serrulata, commonly known as the serrated stilbe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, and clustered in loose racemes, blooming in early summer. Stilbe serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
