    "intro": "Styphelia saxicola, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its habitat. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to the landscape. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Styphelia saxicola is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
