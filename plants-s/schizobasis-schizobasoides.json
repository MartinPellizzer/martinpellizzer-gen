It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are elongated, narrow, and often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Schizobasis schizobasoides prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
