    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 felina, commonly known as the cat willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
