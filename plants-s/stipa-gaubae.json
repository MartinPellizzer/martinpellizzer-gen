    "intro": "Stipa gaubae, commonly known as the Gaubae needlegrass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Stipa gaubae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its drought tolerance and unique foliage."
