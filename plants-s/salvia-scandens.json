    "intro": "Salvia scandens, commonly known as the climbing sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and blue, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly fuzzy texture, often with a minty scent when crushed. Salvia scandens thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for gardens and landscapes."
