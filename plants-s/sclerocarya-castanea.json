    "intro": "Sclerocarya castanea, commonly known as the African hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10\u201320 cm long, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a woody husk, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The bark of Sclerocarya castanea is thick and fissured, providing some protection against drought and herbivory."
