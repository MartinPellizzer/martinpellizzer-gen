    "intro": "Sedum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Sedum palmeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
