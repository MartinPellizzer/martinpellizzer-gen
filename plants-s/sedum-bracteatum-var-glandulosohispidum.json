    "intro": "Sedum bracteatum var. glandulosohispidum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments."
