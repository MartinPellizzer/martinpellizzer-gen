    "intro": "Senecio profundorum, commonly known as the deep valley groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio profundorum produces yellow flowers in late summer, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for local pollinators."
