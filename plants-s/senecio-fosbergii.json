    "intro": "Senecio fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are yellow and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
