    "intro": "Salsola altissima, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual shrub native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, dry fruits containing seeds dispersed by wind. It is highly invasive in many regions, often forming dense stands that outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a challenging weed to control."
