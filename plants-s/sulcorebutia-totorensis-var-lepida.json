    "intro": "Sulcorebutia totorensis var. lepida, commonly known as the Lepidate Candelabra Cactus, is a compact, branching cactus native to the Andes of Peru. It features a short, cylindrical stem with numerous areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
