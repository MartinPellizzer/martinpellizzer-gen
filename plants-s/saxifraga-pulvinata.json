    "intro": "Saxifraga pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically rounded and arranged in a rosette, often covered with a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga pulvinata is well adapted to cold climates and is often found growing on rocky soils in mountainous areas."
