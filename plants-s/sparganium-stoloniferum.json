    "intro": "Sparganium stoloniferum, commonly known as the fragrant bur reed, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are followed by spiky, cone-like fruits. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant is also known for its aromatic foliage, which can be used in traditional herbal remedies."
