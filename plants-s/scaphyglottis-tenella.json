    "intro": "Scaphyglottis tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively through its habitat. Scaphyglottis tenella is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
