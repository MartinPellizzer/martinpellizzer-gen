    "intro": "Stelis calodyction, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Stelis calodyction is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
