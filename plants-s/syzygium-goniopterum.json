    "intro": "Syzygium goniopterum, commonly known as the white sand apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
