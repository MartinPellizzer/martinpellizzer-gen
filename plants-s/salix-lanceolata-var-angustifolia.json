    "intro": "Salix lanceolata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
