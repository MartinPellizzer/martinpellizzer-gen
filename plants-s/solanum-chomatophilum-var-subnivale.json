    "intro": "Solanum chomatophilum var. subnivale, commonly known as the snow-covered nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and small, elliptical leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers, which are followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand frost and snow. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying alpine flora."
