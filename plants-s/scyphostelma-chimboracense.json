    "intro": "Scyphostelma chimboracense, commonly known as the Chimborazo star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Scyphostelma chimboracense is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
