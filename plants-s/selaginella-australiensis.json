    "intro": "Selaginella australiensis, commonly known as the Australian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, spirally arranged leaves that are linear to ovate in shape. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, which are characteristic of its primitive vascular plant classification. Selaginella australiensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential medicinal properties."
