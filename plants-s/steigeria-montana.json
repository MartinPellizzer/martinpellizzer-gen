    "intro": "[WRONG START] Stegiearia montana, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Steigeria montana is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it forms dense mats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
