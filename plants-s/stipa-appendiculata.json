    "intro": "Stipa appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
