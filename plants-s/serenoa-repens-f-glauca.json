The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Botanically, it is distinguished by its compact growth habit and the presence of a waxy cuticle on its foliage. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
