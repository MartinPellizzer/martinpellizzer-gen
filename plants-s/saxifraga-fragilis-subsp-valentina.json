    "intro": "Saxifraga fragilis subsp. valentina, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often pink or red in color, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
