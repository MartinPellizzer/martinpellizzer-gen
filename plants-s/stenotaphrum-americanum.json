    "intro": "Stenotaphrum americanum, commonly known as common St. Augustinegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, dark green blades and a rhizomatous growth habit that allows it to spread aggressively. The plant typically grows in a clump form, with a dense turf that is well-suited for lawns and erosion control. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is tolerant of both shade and heat. Its ability to form a thick sod makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
