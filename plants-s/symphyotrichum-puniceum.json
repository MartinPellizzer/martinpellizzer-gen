    "intro": "Symphyotrichum puniceum, commonly known as the pinkstem goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as prairies and open woods. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are reddish-pink, giving it its common name. Symphyotrichum puniceum is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
