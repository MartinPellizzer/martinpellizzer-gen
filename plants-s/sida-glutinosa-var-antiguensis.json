    "intro": "Sida glutinosa var. antiguensis, commonly known as sticky sida, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadside areas. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in tropical and subtropical regions."
