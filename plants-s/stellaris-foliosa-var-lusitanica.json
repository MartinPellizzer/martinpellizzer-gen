    "intro": "Stellaris foliosa var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian starleaf, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that often display a striking silver or grayish hue on the upper surface. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a preference for moist, shaded environments in woodland areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
