It features fleshy, upright stems and small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or pinkish hue. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum roseum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
