    "intro": "Saponaria ocymoides, commonly known as \"Campion,\" is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly serrated. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Saponaria ocymoides is also notable for its historical use in soap-making due to the soap-like substances found in its roots."
