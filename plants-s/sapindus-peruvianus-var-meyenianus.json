    "intro": "Sapindus peruvianus var. meyenianus, commonly known as the Peruvian soapnut, is a small evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain hard, brown seeds. The outer husk of the fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap due to its saponin content. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
