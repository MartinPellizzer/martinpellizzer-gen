It is characterized by its tropical origin, with species native to regions such as Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, and they produce spadices, which are specialized inflorescences. Stereochlaena species are known for their ornamental value, though some parts of the plant may be toxic. The genus is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens."
