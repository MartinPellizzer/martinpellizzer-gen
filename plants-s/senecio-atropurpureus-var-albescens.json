It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that ranges from gray-green to white, giving it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
