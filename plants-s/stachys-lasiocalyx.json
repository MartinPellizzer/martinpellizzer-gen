    "intro": "Stachys lasiocalyx, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which gives the plant its common name. Stachys lasiocalyx is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in sunny, dry conditions."
