    "intro": "Sorbus cerasoides, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded form and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. Sorbus cerasoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
