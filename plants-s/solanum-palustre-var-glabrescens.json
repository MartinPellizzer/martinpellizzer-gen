It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features erect stems that are generally smooth and glabrous, with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals.
