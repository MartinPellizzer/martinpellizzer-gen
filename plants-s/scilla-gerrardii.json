    "intro": "Scilla gerrardii, commonly known as the pink scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storage and regeneration. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Scilla gerrardii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
