It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits known as pomes. Sorbus foliosa is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
