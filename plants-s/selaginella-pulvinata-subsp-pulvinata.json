    "intro": "Selaginella pulvinata subsp. pulvinata, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved. The plant produces small, sporangium-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. This species is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments."
