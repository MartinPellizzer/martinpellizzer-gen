    "intro": "Stenandrium droseroides subsp. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and often have a reddish or pinkish hue, which helps in attracting prey. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to nutrient-poor habitats."
