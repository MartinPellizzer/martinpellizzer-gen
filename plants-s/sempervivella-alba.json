    "intro": "Sempervivella alba, commonly known as the white houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Sempervivella alba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
