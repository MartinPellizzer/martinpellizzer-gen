    "intro": "Scorpiurus muricatus subsp. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, with small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically oval and slightly hairy, and the plant produces bladder-like seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
