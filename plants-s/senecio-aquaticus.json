    "intro": "Senecio aquaticus, commonly known as water groundsel, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, often semi-shaded conditions. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. It is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
