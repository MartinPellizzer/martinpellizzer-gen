    "intro": "Salvia vinacea, commonly known as scarlet sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia vinacea is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
