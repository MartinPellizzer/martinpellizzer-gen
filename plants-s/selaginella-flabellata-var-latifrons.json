    "intro": "Selaginella flabellata var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and contain the spore-producing organs. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
