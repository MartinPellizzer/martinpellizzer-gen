    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. pedicellata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping catkins and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and riverbanks. Its bark is gray and smooth, with a distinctive flaky texture that peels in thin layers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks through its extensive root system."
