    "intro": "Stellaria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that are arranged in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and usually have a slightly rough texture. Stellaria uniflora thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
