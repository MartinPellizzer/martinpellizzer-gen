    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella oligoseta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland biodiversity and ecological studies."
