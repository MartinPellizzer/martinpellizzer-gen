    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features upright stems and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for borders, hedges, or as a specimen plant."
