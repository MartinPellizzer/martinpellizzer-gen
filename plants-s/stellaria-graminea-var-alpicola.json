    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology includes a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Stellaria graminea var. alpicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous habitats across the Alps and other similar regions."
