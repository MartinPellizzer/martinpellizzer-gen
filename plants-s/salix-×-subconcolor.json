    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 subconcolor, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra, characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types. The plant produces catkins as its primary floral structure, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. Its leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge, and they turn yellow in the fall. This species is often used in reforestation and phytoremediation due to its strong ecological resilience."
