    "intro": "Stapelia variegata f. putida, commonly known as the variegated stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant store water. It produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. This plant is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
