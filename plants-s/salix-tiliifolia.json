    "intro": "Salix tiliifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and it is often found in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Salix tiliifolia has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types but requiring consistent moisture. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
