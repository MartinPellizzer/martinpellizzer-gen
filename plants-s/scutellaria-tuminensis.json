    "intro": "Scutellaria tuminensis, commonly known as Tumani skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
