    "intro": "Solanum merkeri var. ruandense, commonly known as the Ruanda nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Rwanda. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests or undergrowth. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
