    "intro": "Sclerolaena lanata, commonly known as the woolly sclerolaena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Sclerolaena lanata is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
