    "intro": "Sterculia robusta, commonly known as the African breadfruit, is a large tropical tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The tree produces large, spherical fruits that contain a starchy, edible pulp. The fruit is often used as a food source, similar to breadfruit, and is an important component of local diets in some regions. It also plays a role in traditional medicine and has ecological significance in its native habitats."
