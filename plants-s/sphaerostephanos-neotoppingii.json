It is characterized by its spherical, flower-like structures that resemble small, clustered globes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, preferring cool and moist environments. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
