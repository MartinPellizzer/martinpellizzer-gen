    "intro": "Sedum rhodiola var. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems that bear opposite, toothed leaves, which are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to harsh environments make it a distinctive addition to arid landscapes."
