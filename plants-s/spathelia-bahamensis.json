    "intro": "Spathelia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian orchid, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the Bahamas. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
