    "intro": "Salix burqinensis, commonly known as the Burqin willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly found in parts of China and Afghanistan. This shrub or small tree is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
