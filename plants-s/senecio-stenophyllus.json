It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in summer and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
