    "intro": "Spiradiclis howii, commonly known as the Hawaiian spiradiclis, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Spiradiclis howii is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
