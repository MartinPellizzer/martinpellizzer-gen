It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in wetland and marshy environments. Scleria trisulcata has three distinct longitudinal ridges on its stem, which is a key identifying feature.
