    "intro": "Sulpitia, commonly known as the silverleaf sulpitia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plants typically produce small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Sulpitia species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in native plant gardens."
