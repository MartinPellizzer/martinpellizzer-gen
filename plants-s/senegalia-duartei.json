    "intro": "Senegalia duartei, commonly known as the Duarte acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, globular inflorescences that produce nectar for various pollinators. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Senegalia duartei is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood."
