It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Sclerostylis zeylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
