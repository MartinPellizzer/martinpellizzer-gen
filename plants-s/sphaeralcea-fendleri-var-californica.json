It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and scrubland ecosystems."
