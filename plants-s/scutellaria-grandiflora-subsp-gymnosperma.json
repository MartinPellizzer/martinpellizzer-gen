    "intro": "Scutellaria grandiflora subsp. gymnosperma, commonly known as the large-flowered skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in native plant communities."
