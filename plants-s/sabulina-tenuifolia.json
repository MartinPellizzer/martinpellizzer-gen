    "intro": "Sabulina tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it well-adapted to high-altitude ecosystems. Sabulina tenuifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and supports local insect and pollinator populations."
