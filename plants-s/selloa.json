    "intro": "Selloa, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. Selloa species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. The leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Many Selloa species are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
