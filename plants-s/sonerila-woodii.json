    "intro": "Sonerila woodii, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without parasitizing them, often found in the canopy of humid forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Sonerila woodii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
