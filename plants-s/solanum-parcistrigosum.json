    "intro": "Solanum parcistrigosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for cultivation or consumption."
