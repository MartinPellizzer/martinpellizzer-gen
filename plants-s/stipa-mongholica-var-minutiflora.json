    "intro": "Stipa mongholica var. minutiflora, commonly known as the Mongolian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and steppes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
