    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. reuteri, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact form and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
