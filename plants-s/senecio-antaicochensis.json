    "intro": "Senecio antaicochensis, commonly known as the Antaicochensis groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, hairy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
