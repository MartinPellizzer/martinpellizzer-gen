    "intro": "Senegalia hatschbachii, commonly known as the Arizona acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow, globular flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and drought conditions. Senegalia hatschbachii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
