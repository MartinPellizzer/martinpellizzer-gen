    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua var. debilis, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a slight whitish or grayish coating, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky soils, while its compact growth form allows it to withstand strong winds. This variant is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
