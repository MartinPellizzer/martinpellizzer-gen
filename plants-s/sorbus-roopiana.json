    "intro": "Sorbus roopiana, commonly known as the Himalayan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. The leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value."
