    "intro": "Scurrula parasitica var. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic scurrula, is a rare and specialized plant that exhibits hemiparasitic traits, drawing nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can access suitable host species. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, clustered leaves and a short, wiry stem. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for seed dispersal. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
