    "intro": "Scilla non-scripta var. cernua, commonly known as the nodding squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. It is known for its early spring blooms, often appearing before many other spring-flowering plants. The flowers are typically followed by small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds into the wind."
