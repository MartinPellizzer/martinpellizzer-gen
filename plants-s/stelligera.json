    "intro": "Stelligera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive blue or purple flower heads and are typically found in coastal areas. Stelligera species are often adapted to salty, windy environments, which influences their growth patterns and morphology. They have a compact growth habit with silver or gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually arranged in a single head, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers."
