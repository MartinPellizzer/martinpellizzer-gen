    "intro": "Stachys recta var. grandiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf hedge nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and clusters of delicate flowers, though it can become invasive in some regions."
