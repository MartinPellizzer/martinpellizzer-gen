    "intro": "Solanum persicifolium var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features erect stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. These flowers give way to spherical, yellow or orange berries that ripen in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
