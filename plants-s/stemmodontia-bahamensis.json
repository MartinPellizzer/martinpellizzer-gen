    "intro": "Stemmodontia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian stemmodontia, is a flowering plant native to the Bahamas. It is a small, herbaceous shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate ornamental value. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dune environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
