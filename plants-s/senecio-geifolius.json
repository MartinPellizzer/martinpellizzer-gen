    "intro": "Senecio geifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in heads, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of its habitat."
