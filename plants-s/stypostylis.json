    "intro": "Stypostylis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their tall, slender stems and showy, often fragrant flowers. The flowers typically have three petals, with the dorsal sepal being the most prominent and often brightly colored. Stypostylis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they require specific environmental conditions to thrive. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an important part of the Australian flora."
