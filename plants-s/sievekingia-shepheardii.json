    "intro": "Sievekingia shepheardii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. Sievekingia shepheardii is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and nutrient requirements."
