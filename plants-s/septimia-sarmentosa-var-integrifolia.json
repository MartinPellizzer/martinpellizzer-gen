    "intro": "Septimia sarmentosa var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf septimia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with smooth margins. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
