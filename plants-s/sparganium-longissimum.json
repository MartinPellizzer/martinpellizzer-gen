    "intro": "Sparganium longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed bur reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiky, bur-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or submerged depending on water levels. Sparganium longissimum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
