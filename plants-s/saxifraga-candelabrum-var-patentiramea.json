    "intro": "Saxifraga candelabrum var. patentiramea, commonly known as the candleabra saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces striking, candle-like inflorescences. The plant features small, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a branching pattern. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
