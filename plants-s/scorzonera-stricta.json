It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with coarse, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typically blooming from June to August. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Scorzonera stricta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
