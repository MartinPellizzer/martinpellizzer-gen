    "intro": "Sclerostegia, commonly known as the hard-shelled or shield-leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their woody, often shrub-like growth form and distinctive, thickened leaves that provide structural support. The leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Sclerostegia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences."
