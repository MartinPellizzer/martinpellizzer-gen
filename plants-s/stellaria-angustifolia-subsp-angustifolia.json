    "intro": "Stellaria angustifolia subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
