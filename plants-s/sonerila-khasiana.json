    "intro": "Sonerila khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the dense forests of the Khasi Hills. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
