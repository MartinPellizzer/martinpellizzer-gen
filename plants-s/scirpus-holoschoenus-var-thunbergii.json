    "intro": "Scirpus holoschoenus var. thunbergii, commonly known as Thunberg's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic environments. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
