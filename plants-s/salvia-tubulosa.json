    "intro": "Salvia tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems covered in gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple tubular flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich blossoms attract bees and butterflies, contributing to pollinator habitat."
