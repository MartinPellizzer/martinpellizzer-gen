    "intro": "Silene exscapa var. caulescens, commonly known as the slender catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright, leafless stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its more elongated stem compared to the typical form of Silene exscapa."
