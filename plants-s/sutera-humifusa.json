    "intro": "Sutera humifusa, commonly known as the creeping lily or ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots allow it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Sutera humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
