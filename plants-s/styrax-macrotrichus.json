    "intro": "Styrax macrotrichus, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its resinous sap, which is used in traditional medicine, is one of its most notable botanical features. Styrax macrotrichus thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
