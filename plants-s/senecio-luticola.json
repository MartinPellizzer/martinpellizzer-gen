    "intro": "Senecio luticola, commonly known as the Lake Turkana senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Kenya and Tanzania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Senecio luticola plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for local wildlife."
