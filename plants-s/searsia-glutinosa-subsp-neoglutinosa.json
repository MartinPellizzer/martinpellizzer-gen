    "intro": "Searsia glutinosa subsp. neoglutinosa, commonly known as the silver tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a red color, attracting various bird species. The silver tree is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy plant in dry environments."
