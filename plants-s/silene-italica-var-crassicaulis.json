    "intro": "Silene italica var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the Italian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene italica var. crassicaulis is often found in open fields, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
