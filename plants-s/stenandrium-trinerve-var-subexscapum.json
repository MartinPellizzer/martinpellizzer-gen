    "intro": "Stenandrium trinerve var. subexscapum, commonly known as the narrow-veined stenandrium, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with three distinct veins running from the base to the tip. This variant is notable for its subexscapate inflorescence, where the floral stems are slightly elongated but not fully exserted."
