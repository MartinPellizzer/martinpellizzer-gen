    "intro": "Solenanthus petiolaris var. coronatus, commonly known as the crowned solenanthus, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive crown-like arrangement of leaves at the base of the stem, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
