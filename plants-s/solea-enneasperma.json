    "intro": "Solea enneasperma, commonly known as the nine-armed sea star, is a marine echinoderm belonging to the family Asteriidae. It is characterized by its distinctive radial symmetry, typically displaying nine arms that can vary in length. The plant, more accurately a marine invertebrate, has a central disc covered with small, spiny projections. Its body is encased in a calcareous skeleton, which provides structural support and protection. This species is often found in shallow coastal waters, where it plays a role in the ecosystem by scavenging for organic matter."
