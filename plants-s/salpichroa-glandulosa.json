    "intro": "Salpichroa glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyseed grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces tiny, sticky seeds that adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Salpichroa glandulosa is often found in the western United States and parts of Canada."
