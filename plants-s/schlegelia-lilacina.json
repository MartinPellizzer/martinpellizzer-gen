It is characterized by its delicate, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. Native to parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ornamental gardens and ecological studies."
