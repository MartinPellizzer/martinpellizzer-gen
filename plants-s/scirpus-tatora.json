    "intro": "Scirpus tatora, commonly known as the marsh reed, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually blade-like and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, greenish-brown spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Scirpus tatora plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
