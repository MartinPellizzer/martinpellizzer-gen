    "intro": "Schnella accrescens, commonly known as the rapid-growing fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family. It is characterized by its fast growth rate and delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. The leaves are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
