    "intro": "Scrophularia griffithii subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species, and it produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It is part of the Scrophulariaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations."
