    "intro": "Sapindus adenophyllus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces fruit that resembles a small, rough sphere, often covered in a white, waxy coating. The fruit contains seeds surrounded by a pulp that can be used to make a natural soap due to its saponin content. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
