    "intro": "Sorbus albovii, commonly known as the white-fruited whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by distinctive white, fleshy berries that ripen in late summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin layers as the tree matures. Sorbus albovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique fruiting display."
