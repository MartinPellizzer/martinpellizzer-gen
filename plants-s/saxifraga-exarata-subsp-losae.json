    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subsp. losae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or small rosettes of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and is often found in areas with poor soil and limited moisture."
