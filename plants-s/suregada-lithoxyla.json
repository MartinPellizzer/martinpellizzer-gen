    "intro": "Suregada lithoxyla, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
