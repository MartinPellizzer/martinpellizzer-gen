    "intro": "Salsola scabra, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and dry fields. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with thick, succulent stems and small, spine-tipped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds widely. Salsola scabra is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native range."
