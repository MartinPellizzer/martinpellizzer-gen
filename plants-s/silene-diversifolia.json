    "intro": "Silene diversifolia, commonly known as the variable catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene diversifolia is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy flowers and adaptations to cold climates."
