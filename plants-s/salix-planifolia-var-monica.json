    "intro": "Salix planifolia var. monica, commonly known as the Monica willow, is a variant of the broadleaf willow native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a bright green. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
