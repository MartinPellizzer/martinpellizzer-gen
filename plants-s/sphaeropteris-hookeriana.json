    "intro": "Sphaeropteris hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
