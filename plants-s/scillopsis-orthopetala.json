    "intro": "Scillopsis orthopetala, commonly known as the upright petal scillopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scillopsis orthopetala is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
