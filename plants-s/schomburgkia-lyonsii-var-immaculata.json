    "intro": "Schomburgkia lyonsii var. immaculata, commonly known as the White Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that resemble those of the Ghost Orchid, with a unique lack of green pigmentation in its petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on trees or in swampy areas. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, and it is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
