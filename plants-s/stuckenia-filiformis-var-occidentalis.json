    "intro": "Stuckenia filiformis var. occidentalis, commonly known as western slender waterplantain, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Alismataceae family and is typically found in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow lakes. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
