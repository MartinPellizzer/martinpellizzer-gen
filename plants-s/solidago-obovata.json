    "intro": "Solidago obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and obovate, meaning they are widest near the base, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Solidago obovata is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
