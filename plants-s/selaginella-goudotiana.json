    "intro": "Selaginella goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has distinctive, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around its stems, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores. Selaginella goudotiana is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
