    "intro": "Stapelia clavicorona, commonly known as the helmet-shaped stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost fleshy appearance. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it a popular specimen among succulent enthusiasts."
