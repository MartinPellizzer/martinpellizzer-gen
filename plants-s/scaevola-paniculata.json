    "intro": "Scaevola paniculata, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, with four petals arranged in a distinctive asymmetrical pattern. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. Scaevola paniculata is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
