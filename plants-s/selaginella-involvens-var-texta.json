    "intro": "Selaginella involvens var. texta, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen, fern-like fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant is native to the eastern and central regions of the United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically arranged in whorls, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila at the base of the fronds. Selaginella involvens var. texta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
