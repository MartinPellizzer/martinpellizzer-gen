    "intro": "Sebastiania daphnoides, commonly known as the silverleaf sebastiania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry forests. Sebastiania daphnoides is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique aesthetic."
