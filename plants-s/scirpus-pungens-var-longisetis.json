It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with long, bristly hairs along the edges. This variety thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
