    "intro": "Solanum plastisexum, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that often have a hairy texture. Its flowers are typically white or purple, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Due to its variability in morphology, it is sometimes considered a species complex within the Solanum genus."
