    "intro": "Secale cereale var. triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered rye, is a variant of rye characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces three florets per spikelet, a trait that sets it apart from the more common two-flowered rye. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in agricultural research due to its genetic variability. It is also of interest in ecological studies for its role in soil stabilization and biodiversity."
