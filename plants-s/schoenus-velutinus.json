    "intro": "Schoenus velutinus, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silky, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Schoenus velutinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its visual texture and adaptability."
