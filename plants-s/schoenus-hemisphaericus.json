    "intro": "Schoenus hemisphaericus, commonly known as the spherical bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of flowering heads that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowering structures are often surrounded by pale, fluffy bracts. Schoenus hemisphaericus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
