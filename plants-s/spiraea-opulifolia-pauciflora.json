    "intro": "Spiraea opulifolia pauciflora, commonly known as the slender spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
