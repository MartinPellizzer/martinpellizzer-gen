    "intro": "Shortiopsis, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Shortiopsis species are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indirect light and their vibrant, long-lasting blooms. They require well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
