It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in arid gardens."
