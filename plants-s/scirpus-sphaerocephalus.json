    "intro": "Scirpus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and dense, rounded clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The globe sedge is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
