    "intro": "Stipa richteriana var. hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-nutrient soils and drought conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
