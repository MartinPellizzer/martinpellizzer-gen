    "intro": "Salacia lehmbachii var. leonensis, commonly known as the Leonense Salacia, is a rare variant of the Salacia genus native to specific regions of South America. It is a climbing plant characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface, and the plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
