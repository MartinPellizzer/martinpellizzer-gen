    "intro": "Stenogyne sessilis var. hexantha, commonly known as the Hawaiian hexantha false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in wet forest habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are usually pink or white. This variant is distinguished by its sessile (stalkless) flowers and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and endemic status."
