    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 gaubae, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Salix amygdaloides and Salix matsudana, characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
