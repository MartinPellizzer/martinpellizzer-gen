    "intro": "Saxifraga monticola, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga monticola is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
