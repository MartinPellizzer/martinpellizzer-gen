    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. rosada, commonly known as the Rosada potato, is a botanical variant of the Andean potato species. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red pigmentation in the tubers, which is due to the presence of anthocyanins. The plant typically grows in the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. This variety is valued not only for its unique appearance but also for its potential nutritional and agricultural significance."
