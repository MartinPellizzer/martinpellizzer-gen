    "intro": "Selenodesmium siamense, commonly known as the Siam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to trees without parasitizing them. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Selenodesmium siamense is considered a vulnerable species."
