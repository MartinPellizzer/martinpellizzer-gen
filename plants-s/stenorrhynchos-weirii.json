    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos weirii, commonly known as the Cape York lily, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Stenorrhynchos weirii is typically found in sandy soils near coastal areas and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and seasonal droughts. Its unique appearance makes it a popular subject for botanical study and horticultural interest."
