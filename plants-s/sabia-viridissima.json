It is characterized by its striking emerald-green foliage, which remains vibrant throughout the year. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender, woody stems. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Sabia viridissima is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
