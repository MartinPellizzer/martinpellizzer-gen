    "intro": "Sceptridium oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida feathercup, is a rare and endangered species of sedges native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a flowering structure known as a capitulum. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Sceptridium oneidense is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
