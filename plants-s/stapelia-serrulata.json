    "intro": "Stapelia serrulata, commonly known as the serrated stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, meaty flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a distinctive scent. Its leaves are usually small and spiny, providing some protection against herbivores. Stapelia serrulata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
