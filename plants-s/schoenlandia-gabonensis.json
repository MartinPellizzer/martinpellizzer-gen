It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has large, compound leaves with long, slender leaflets, and it produces woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.
