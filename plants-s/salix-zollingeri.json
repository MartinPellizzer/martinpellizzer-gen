    "intro": "Salix zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones along rivers and streams."
