    "intro": "Schismatoglottis nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis's schismatoglottis, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo, it thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. The plant is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is a terrestrial orchid, often found growing in dense undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
