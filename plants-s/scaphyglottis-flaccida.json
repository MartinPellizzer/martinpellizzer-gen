    "intro": "Scaphyglottis flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Scaphyglottis flaccida is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
