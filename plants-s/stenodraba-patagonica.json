    "intro": "Stenodraba patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Stenodraba patagonica is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme weather conditions."
