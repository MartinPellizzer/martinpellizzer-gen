It is typically found in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, demonstrating its adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Its flowering stems can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
