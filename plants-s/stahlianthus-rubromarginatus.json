    "intro": "Stahlianthus rubromarginatus, commonly known as the red-margin stahlianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red margins on its lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
