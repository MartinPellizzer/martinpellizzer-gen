    "intro": "Stellaria humifusa f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sandstar, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, oval to ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are star-shaped, with five petals that are pale blue to white in color, and they bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
