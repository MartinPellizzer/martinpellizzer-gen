    "intro": "Saxifraga nudicaulis subsp. vaginalis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features rosettes of closely packed, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, arranged in a terminal cluster. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for high-altitude habitats where few plants can survive."
