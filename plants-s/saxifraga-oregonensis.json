    "intro": "Saxifraga oregonensis, commonly known as Oregon saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the stem tips. Saxifraga oregonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
