    "intro": "Solanum blodgettii, commonly known as Blodgett's nightshade, is a rare and endangered species native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color. Its fruit is a globose berry that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
