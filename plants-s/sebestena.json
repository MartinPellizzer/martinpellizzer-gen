    "intro": "Sebestena, commonly known as the \"bitter apple\" or \"wild apple,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, with Sebestena coccinea being the most well-known, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that are typically bitter and not suitable for human consumption. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive glandular texture. Sebestena is valued in traditional medicine for its potential antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
