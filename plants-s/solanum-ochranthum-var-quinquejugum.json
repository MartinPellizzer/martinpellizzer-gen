    "intro": "Solanum ochranthum var. quinquejugum, commonly known as the five-lobed nightshade, is a species native to certain regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
