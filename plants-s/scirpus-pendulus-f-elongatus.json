    "intro": "Scirpus pendulus f. elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its elongated, drooping stems that can reach significant heights, often exceeding those of the typical Scirpus pendulus. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots help stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecosystems. This form is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
