    "intro": "Schefflera polypyrena, commonly known as the Southern Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of multiple leaflets arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera polypyrena is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
