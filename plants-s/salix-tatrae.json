    "intro": "Salix tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra willow, is a shrub native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, mountainous environments and is often found along streams and in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, Salix tatrae is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family."
