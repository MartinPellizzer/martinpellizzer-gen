    "intro": "Sarcoglottis misera, commonly known as the sad glottis, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae, which is characterized by its distinctive, often tubular flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are known for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-harvesting, Sarcoglottis misera is critically threatened with extinction in the wild."
