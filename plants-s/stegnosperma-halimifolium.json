    "intro": "Stegnosperma halimifolium, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Stegnosperma halimifolium is well adapted to saline and wind-swept conditions, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
