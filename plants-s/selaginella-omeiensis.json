    "intro": "Selaginella omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei spruce moss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the Selaginellaceae family. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and is often found in humid, shaded environments. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. Selaginella omeiensis is native to China and is considered a relict species due to its evolutionary history. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution and adaptation."
