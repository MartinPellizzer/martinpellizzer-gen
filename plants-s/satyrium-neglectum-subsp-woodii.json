    "intro": "Satyrium neglectum subsp. woodii, commonly known as the Wood's ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and cypress swamps. It has a unique mycorrhizal relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
