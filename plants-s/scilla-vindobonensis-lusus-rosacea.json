    "intro": "Scilla vindobonensis lusus rosacea, commonly known as the Rosacea Scilla, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained and sunny habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring before the flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
