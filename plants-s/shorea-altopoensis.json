    "intro": "Shorea altopoensis, commonly known as the highland white ironwood, is a tropical tree species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The tree typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, often reaching heights of up to 50 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. Shorea altopoensis plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
