    "intro": "Senecio gypsophilus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Senecio gypsophilus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
