It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
