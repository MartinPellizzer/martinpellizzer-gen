    "intro": "Salix spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper to a point. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water sources. Salix spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
