    "intro": "Sublimia aevidaps, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, pale lavender flowers with a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Sublimia aevidaps is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
