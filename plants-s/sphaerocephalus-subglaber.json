It is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
