    "intro": "Sempervivum hybridum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. Its flowers are typically pink or red, appearing in clusters on tall stalks during the summer months. Sempervivum hybridum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
