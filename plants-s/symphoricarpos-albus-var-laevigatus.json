    "intro": "Symphoricarpos albus var. laevigatus, commonly known as smooth snowberry, is a shrub native to North America. It features smooth, pale green stems and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the summer. The plant bears red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plant species."
