It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast regions. The plants typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive blue or violet hue. Souliea species are herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic beauty."
