    "intro": "Sclerophylax tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sclerophyll, is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, narrow leaves. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in Mediterranean climates where it is adapted to dry conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. Its woody stems are thickened and often covered in a layer of resin, which helps reduce water loss. Sclerophylax tenuicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
