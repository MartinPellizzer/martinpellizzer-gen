    "intro": "Sambucus ebulus subsp. africana, commonly known as the African elderberry, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the autumn. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or along stream banks."
