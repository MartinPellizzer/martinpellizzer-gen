    "intro": "Salix javanica, commonly known as the Javan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
