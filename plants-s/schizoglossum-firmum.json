    "intro": "Schizoglossum firmum, commonly known as the rigid thimble cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Schizoglossum firmum is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a slow-growing plant that is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
