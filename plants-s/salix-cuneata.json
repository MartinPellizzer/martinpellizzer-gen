    "intro": "Salix cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones, along stream banks, and in wet meadows. Salix cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
