It typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant has hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
