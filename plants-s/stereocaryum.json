    "intro": "Stereocaryum, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Stereocaryum glabrum, which is native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that resemble snowballs, hence their common name. The leaves are typically leathery and evergreen, providing a striking contrast to the showy floral displays. Stereocaryum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are well-suited to warm, sunny climates."
