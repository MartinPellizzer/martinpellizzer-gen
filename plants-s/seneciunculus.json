    "intro": "Seneciunculus, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a compact growth habit with a single, small flowering head surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, resembling those of the sunflower, though on a much smaller scale. Seneciunculus is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
