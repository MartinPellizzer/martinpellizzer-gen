    "intro": "Spodiopogon binatus, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
