    "intro": "Sorghum truchmenorum, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a hardy grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in poor soils and is often used for forage or as a cover crop in dryland agriculture. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
