    "intro": "Segurola, commonly known as *Eupatorium cannabinum*, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often hairy and can become woody at the base, and it thrives in moist, sunny habitats like meadows and streambanks. Segurola is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
