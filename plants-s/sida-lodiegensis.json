    "intro": "Sida lodiegensis, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil conditions, and it is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Sida lodiegensis is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
