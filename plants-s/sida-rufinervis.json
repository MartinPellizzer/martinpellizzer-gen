It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Sida rufinervis is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks."
