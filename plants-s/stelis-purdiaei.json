    "intro": "Stelis purdiaei, commonly known as the Pudia Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Stelis purdiaei thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media."
