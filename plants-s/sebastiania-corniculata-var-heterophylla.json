    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-sepal sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that vary in shape and size, giving rise to its varietal name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and adaptability to humid conditions."
