    "intro": "Sisymbrium alpinum, commonly known as alpine broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its harsh mountainous environment."
