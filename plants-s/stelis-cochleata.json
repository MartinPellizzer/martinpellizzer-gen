    "intro": "Stelis cochleata, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of flowers along the stem, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating efficient water retention. Stelis cochleata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth."
