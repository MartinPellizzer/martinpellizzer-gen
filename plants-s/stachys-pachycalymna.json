    "intro": "Stachys pachycalymna, commonly known as the broad-leaved hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Stachys pachycalymna thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
