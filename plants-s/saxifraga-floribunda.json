    "intro": "Saxifraga floribunda, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Saxifraga floribunda is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is a common indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
