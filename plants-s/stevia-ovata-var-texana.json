    "intro": "Stevia ovata var. texana, commonly known as Texas stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Like other stevia species, it contains high levels of steviol glycosides, which are used as natural sweeteners."
