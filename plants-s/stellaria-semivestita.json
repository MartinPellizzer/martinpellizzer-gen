    "intro": "Stellaria semivestita, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has delicate, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Stellaria semivestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes."
