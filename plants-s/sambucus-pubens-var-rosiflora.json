It features compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible when ripe but toxic when unripe. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
