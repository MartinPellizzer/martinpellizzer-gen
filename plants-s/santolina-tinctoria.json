It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Santolina tinctoria is also valued for its use in herbal medicine and as a source of natural dye."
