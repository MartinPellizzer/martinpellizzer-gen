    "intro": "Selleola, commonly known as the silver thread plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, often arranged in spikes. Selleola thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact, evergreen foliage throughout the year."
