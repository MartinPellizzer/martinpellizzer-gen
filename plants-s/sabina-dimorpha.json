    "intro": "Sabina dimorpha, commonly known as the Japanese red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scaly, reddish-brown bark. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically short and twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form. Sabina dimorpha is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
