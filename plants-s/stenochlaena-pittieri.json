    "intro": "Stenochlaena pittieri, commonly known as the Bornean arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizomes are sometimes harvested for their starchy properties, though its medicinal uses are less widely documented."
