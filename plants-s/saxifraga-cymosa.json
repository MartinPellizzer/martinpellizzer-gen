    "intro": "Saxifraga cymosa, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense clusters of small, often white or pink flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its often harsh habitat. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga cymosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky areas."
