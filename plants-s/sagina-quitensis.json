    "intro": "Sagina quitensis, commonly known as the Andean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its native range. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant."
