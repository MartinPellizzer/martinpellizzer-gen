    "intro": "Schismatoglottis, commonly known as the arrowleaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Schismatoglottis species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. They have broad, arrow-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. The genus is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
