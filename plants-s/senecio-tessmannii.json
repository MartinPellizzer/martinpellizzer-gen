    "intro": "Senecio tessmannii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio tessmannii is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
