It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a single, terminal head. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Silphium nuttallianum is known for its historical use by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes."
