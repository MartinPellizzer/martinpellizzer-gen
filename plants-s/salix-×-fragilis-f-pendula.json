    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis f. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. The plant has slender, flexible stems that hang in long, drooping clusters, giving it a graceful appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its propagation."
