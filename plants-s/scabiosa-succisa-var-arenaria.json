It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to dry, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.
