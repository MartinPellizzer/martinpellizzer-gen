    "intro": "Spiranthes graminea var. praecox, commonly known as early purple spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spiral-shaped flower spikes. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing small, pale purple to white flowers that are clustered in a tight spiral. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for early-season pollinators."
