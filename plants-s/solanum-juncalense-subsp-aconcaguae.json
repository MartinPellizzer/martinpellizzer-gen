    "intro": "Solanum juncalense subsp. aconcaguae, commonly known as the Aconcagua nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
