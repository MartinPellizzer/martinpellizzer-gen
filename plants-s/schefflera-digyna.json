    "intro": "Schefflera digyna, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of palmate leaves that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, making it a compact and ornamental choice for indoor or outdoor gardens. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. Schefflera digyna thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering to prevent root rot."
