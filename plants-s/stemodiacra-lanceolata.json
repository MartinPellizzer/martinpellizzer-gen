    "intro": "Stemodiacra lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features a slender, erect stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The leaves are lance-shaped, typically 5 to 15 centimeters long, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
