    "intro": "Streblochaete sanjappae, commonly known as the Sanjappae orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom during the monsoon season. The plant has a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and specialized orchid roots known as rhizomes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
