    "intro": "Spathodea nilotica f. bryanii, commonly known as the Bryan's flame tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a contrasting element to its showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The species is also valued for its ability to grow in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments."
