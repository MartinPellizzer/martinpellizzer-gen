    "intro": "Sapium allenii, commonly known as the red swamp gumbo, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Sapium allenii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
