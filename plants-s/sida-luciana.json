    "intro": "Sida luciana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. Sida luciana is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
