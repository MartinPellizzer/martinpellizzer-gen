It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces spikes of small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.
