    "intro": "Salsola dioeca, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is an annual or biennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has alternate, fleshy, spiny leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in some regions. Salsola dioeca is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and widespread species."
