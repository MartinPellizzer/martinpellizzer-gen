    "intro": "Sponia timorensis, commonly known as the Timor sponia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Timor in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sponia timorensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
