    "intro": "Sedum muleyanum, commonly known as the Muleya sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Sedum muleyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance garden settings."
