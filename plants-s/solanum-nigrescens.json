It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its small, white or purple flowers give way to berries that start green and turn black as they mature. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested."
