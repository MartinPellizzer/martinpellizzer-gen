    "intro": "Salix subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
