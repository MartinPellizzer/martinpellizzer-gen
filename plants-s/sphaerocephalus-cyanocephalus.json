    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus cyanocephalus, commonly known as the blue-headed globeflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a vivid splash of color to alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Sphaerocephalus cyanocephalus is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
