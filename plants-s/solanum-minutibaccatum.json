    "intro": "Solanum minutibaccatum, commonly known as the small-fruited nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruits are small, berry-like, and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its restricted distribution and limited research, it remains a less-studied species within the nightshade family."
