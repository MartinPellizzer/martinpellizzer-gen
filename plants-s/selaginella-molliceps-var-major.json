    "intro": "Selaginella molliceps var. major, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, creeping stems that bear dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This ancient plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and fire."
