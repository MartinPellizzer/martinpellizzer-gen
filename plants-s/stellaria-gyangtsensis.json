    "intro": "Stellaria gyangtsensis, commonly known as the Yunnan starwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves, which help it withstand the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. It is often found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution, Stellaria gyangtsensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
