It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant features small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, sponge-like hairs. Sphingium decumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
