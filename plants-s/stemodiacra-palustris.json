    "intro": "Stemodiacra palustris, commonly known as the marsh stemodia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and alternate, typically growing along the stem in a dense, grass-like manner. Stemodiacra palustris plays an important role in stabilizing soil in moist environments and supporting local biodiversity."
