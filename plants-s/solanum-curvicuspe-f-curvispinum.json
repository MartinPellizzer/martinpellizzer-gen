    "intro": "Solanum curvicuspe f. curvispinum, commonly known as the curly-spined nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply curved spines on the stems and leaves. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticultural settings."
