    "intro": "Sisymbrium crassifolium subsp. laxiflorum, commonly known as the broad-leaved wild radish, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust, herbaceous growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are dry, pod-like structures that split open to release seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields."
