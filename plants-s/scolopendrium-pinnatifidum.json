    "intro": "Scolopendrium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling the leaves of holly. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
