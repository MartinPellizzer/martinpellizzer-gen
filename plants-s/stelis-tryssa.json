    "intro": "Stelis tryssa, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a species of orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Stelis tryssa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated in horticultural collections for its delicate beauty."
