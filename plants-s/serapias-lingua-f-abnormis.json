    "intro": "Serapias lingua f. abnormis, commonly known as the twisted tongue orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, twisted floral structure that resembles a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils in Mediterranean regions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a strikingly elongated, curling lip. This variant is noted for its unusual morphology and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
