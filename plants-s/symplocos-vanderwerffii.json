    "intro": "Symplocos vanderwerffii, commonly known as Vanderwerff's waxleaf, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. This species is adapted to the humid, shaded environments of coastal and lowland forests in Hawaii."
