    "intro": "Stylophyllum traskiae, commonly known as the Trask's sea fan, is a colonial marine organism belonging to the order Gorgonacea. It is characterized by its branching, calcified skeleton that provides structural support for its soft, fleshy polyps. The polyps are typically translucent and bear tentacles used for capturing plankton, its primary food source. This species is found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, often growing on coral reefs. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of reef ecosystems."
