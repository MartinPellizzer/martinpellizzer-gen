    "intro": "Scaphosepalum medinae, commonly known as the Medina's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated flowers that display a striking combination of colors, often featuring a mix of white, purple, and pink hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory with high humidity and moderate light. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to capture minimal light in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Scaphosepalum medinae is considered a conservation concern."
