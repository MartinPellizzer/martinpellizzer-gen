    "intro": "Sorghum rigidum, commonly known as stiff sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually small and clustered, producing tiny grains that are wind-pollinated. Sorghum rigidum is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and distinctive appearance."
