It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems."
