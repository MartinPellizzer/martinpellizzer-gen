    "intro": "Sedum phyllanthum, commonly known as the stonecrop or liveforever plant, is a succulent species native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for drought-tolerant landscapes."
