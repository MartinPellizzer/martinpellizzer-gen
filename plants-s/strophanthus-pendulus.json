    "intro": "Strophanthus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging strophanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, woody capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
