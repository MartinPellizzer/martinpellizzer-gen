    "intro": "Stenoglossum corynephorum, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a companion plant in gardens."
