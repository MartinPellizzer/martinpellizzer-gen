It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Solanum williamsii belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
