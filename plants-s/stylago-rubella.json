    "intro": "Stylago rubella, commonly known as the red-stemmed twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Stylago rubella is often found in colonies, and its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer."
