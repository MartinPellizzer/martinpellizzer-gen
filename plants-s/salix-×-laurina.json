    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 laurina, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and elegant look. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and wind-pollinated. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and along waterways."
