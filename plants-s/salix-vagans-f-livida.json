    "intro": "Salix vagans f. livida, commonly known as the white willow variant, is a rare and unique form of the weeping willow. It is characterized by its pale green to white foliage, which contrasts with the typical green of the standard Salix vagans. This form is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wetlands. The leaves are elongated and pendulous, contributing to its graceful, flowing appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in specific ecological conditions."
