    "intro": "Selaginella heterodonton, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microsporangia and megasporangia, which are typically located on the stems. Selaginella heterodonton is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including drought and poor soil, due to its specialized water-storing tissues."
