    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 figertii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix \u00d7 figertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or erosion-prone areas."
