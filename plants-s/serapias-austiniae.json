    "intro": "Serapias austiniae, commonly known as Austin's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the limestone hills of central Texas. It is a flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble orchids. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Serapias austiniae is considered a conservation concern."
