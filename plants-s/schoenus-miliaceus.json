    "intro": "Schoenus miliaceus, commonly known as the millet grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its native environment. Schoenus miliaceus is often found in wetlands and marshy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
