    "intro": "Solanum urbanum, commonly known as the urban nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces purple or violet berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments, hence its common name. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
