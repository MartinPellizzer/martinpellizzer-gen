    "intro": "Scindapsus longipetiolatus, commonly known as the silver vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or variegated appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage, it is popular as a houseplant and is also used in traditional medicine."
