    "intro": "Sorghum bicorne, commonly known as kafir corn, is a tall, drought-resistant grass native to Africa. It produces tall stalks with large, triangular leaves and panicles of small, hard, black seeds. The plant is highly adaptable to poor soils and requires minimal water, making it a staple crop in arid regions. Its seeds are used for food, animal feed, and brewing, while the stalks are used for construction and thatching. Sorghum bicorne plays a vital role in both agriculture and traditional practices across sub-Saharan Africa."
