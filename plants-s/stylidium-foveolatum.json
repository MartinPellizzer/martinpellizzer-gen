    "intro": "Stylidium foveolatum, commonly known as the sunburst burr. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia, characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant has a short, erect stem with hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, such as beetles and flies, due to their strong scent and nectar production. Stylidium foveolatum is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
