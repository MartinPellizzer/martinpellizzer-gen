    "intro": "Senegalia ogadensis, commonly known as the African screw tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, and its leaves are often small and hairy to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators, and its pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
