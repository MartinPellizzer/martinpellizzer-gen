    "intro": "Stenopadus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Stenopadus species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
