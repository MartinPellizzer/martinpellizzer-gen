    "intro": "Schoenus subfascicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Schoenus subfascicularis plays an important role in wetland biodiversity and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
