    "intro": "Sedum angelosii, commonly known as Angelosii stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
