    "intro": "Silene mesatlantica var. macrotricha, commonly known as the broad-fruited bluemink, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
