    "intro": "Salix richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
