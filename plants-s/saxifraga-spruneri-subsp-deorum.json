    "intro": "Saxifraga spruneri subsp. deorum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding mountain regions. It features rosettes of dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing a frost-resistant adaptation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
