    "intro": "Simpsonanthus, commonly known as the Simpson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the orchid family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Simpsonanthus is a terrestrial orchid, meaning it grows from the ground rather than on trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
