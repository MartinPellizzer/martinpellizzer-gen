    "intro": "Sphaeranthus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, spherical seed capsules are a distinctive feature, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Sphaeranthus microcephalus is adapted to withstand drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
