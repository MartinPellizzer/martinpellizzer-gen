    "intro": "Semenovia lasiocarpa subsp. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's hairystem lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, crustose thallus that forms a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The plant has a distinctive ascomycete structure with apothecia that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found on limestone or sandstone substrates. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions."
