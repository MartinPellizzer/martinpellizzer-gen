    "intro": "Sium villosum, commonly known as hogweed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant features large, compound leaves that are often lobed and can grow up to several feet in length. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Sium villosum is native to parts of Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive."
