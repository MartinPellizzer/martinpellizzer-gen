    "intro": "Scilla siberica subsp. otschiauriae, commonly known as the Armenian scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different flower color and habitat preferences compared to other Scilla species."
