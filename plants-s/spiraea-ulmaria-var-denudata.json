    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. denudata, commonly known as the nakedleaf meadow spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced or absent along the stems, giving it its \"nakedleaf\" appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
