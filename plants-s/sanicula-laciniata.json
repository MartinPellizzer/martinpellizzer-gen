    "intro": "Sanicula laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf sanicle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features a slender, upright stem with palmately compound leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in umbels and bloom in early summer. Sanicula laciniata is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
