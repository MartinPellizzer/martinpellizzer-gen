    "intro": "Syzygium tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored syzygium, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves, which display shades of white, green, and pink, creating a visually appealing foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Syzygium tricolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
