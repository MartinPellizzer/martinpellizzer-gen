    "intro": "Stereochilus ringens, commonly known as the clustered rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with a rosette of fleshy, glabrous leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive, recurved petals. Its flowering period typically occurs during the cooler months, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
