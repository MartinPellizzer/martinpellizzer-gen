    "intro": "Samolus alyssoides, commonly known as the lesser waterplantain, is a small herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and flies. Samolus alyssoides is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
