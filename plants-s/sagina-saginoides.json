    "intro": "Sagina saginoides, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Sagina saginoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas."
