    "intro": "Scandix affinis, commonly known as the lesser hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and some toxic species. The plant features a thick, hairy stem with large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in an umbrella-like inflorescence called a umbel. Scandix affinis is often found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
