    "intro": "Sabina chinensis f. aureoglobosa, commonly known as the golden globe Chinese juniper, is a compact, ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its dark green stems. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a textured appearance. It produces tiny, blue-gray berries that are ornamental but not edible. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
