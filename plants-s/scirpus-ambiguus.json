    "intro": "Scirpus ambiguus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments across the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread and colonize wet soils effectively. Scirpus ambiguus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and wetland organisms."
