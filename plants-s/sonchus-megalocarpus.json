It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with stiff, spiny leaves. The plant produces large, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spherical, prickly seed heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Botanically, it is characterized by its extensive root system and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
