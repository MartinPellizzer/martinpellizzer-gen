    "intro": "Salpichroa sarmentosa, commonly known as the trailing grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats or runners along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight hairy texture. Salpichroa sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
