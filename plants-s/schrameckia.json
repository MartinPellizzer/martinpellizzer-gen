    "intro": "Schrameckia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Schrameckia has small, elongated leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
