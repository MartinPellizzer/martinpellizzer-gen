    "intro": "Striga humilis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria to the roots of the host plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, annual life cycle. It is native to Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to reduce crop yields. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent challenge for farmers."
