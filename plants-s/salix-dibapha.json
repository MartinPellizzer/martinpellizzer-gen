    "intro": "Salix dibapha, commonly known as the two-colored willow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often a striking combination of green and silver. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow or reddish in color. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Salix dibapha is often found in rocky or sandy soils along riverbanks and in coastal areas."
