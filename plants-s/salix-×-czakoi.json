    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 czakoi, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix triandra (tallow tree), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. The bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin layers, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
