    "intro": "Seseli merkuloviczii, commonly known as the Merkulovici's seseli, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
