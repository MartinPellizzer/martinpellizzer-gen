    "intro": "Sedum anglicum subsp. arenarium, commonly known as the sand sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It is well-suited for rock gardens, dry landscapes, and as a ground cover in xeriscaped areas. Its hardy nature makes it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
