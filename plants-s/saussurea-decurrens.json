    "intro": "Saussurea decurrens, commonly known as the Himalayan arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a single, showy inflorescence. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
