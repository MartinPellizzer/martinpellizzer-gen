    "intro": "Salpichroa glandulosa var. longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
