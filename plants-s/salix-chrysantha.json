    "intro": "Salix chrysantha, commonly known as the golden willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elongated and have a rough texture, often turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
