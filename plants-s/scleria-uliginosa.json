    "intro": "Scleria uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soil. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, three-lobed flowers in spike-like clusters. Scleria uliginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
