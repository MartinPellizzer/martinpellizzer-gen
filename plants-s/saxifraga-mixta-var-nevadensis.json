    "intro": "Saxifraga mixta var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered with a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga mixta var. nevadensis is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
