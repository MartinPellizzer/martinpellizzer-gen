    "intro": "Streblus taxoides var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved strangler fig, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique growth habit and morphological features. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, initially developing on the branches of host trees before eventually enveloping them, a process known as stranglehold. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The species produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife and local communities."
