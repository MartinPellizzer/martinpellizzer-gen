    "intro": "Selaginella watsonii, commonly known as the climbing spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Selaginella watsonii is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-retaining tissues."
