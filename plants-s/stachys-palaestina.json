    "intro": "Stachys palaestina, commonly known as Palestinian hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features square, hairy stems and produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Stachys palaestina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
