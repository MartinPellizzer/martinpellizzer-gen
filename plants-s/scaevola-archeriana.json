    "intro": "Scaevola archeriana, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, sky-blue to white flowers that resemble mist. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with a distinctive blue hue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Scaevola archeriana is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salty sea air."
