    "intro": "Silene nocturna subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the night-flowering catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that open at night. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Silene nocturna subsp. neglecta is adapted to dry conditions and is considered a rare or endangered species in some regions."
