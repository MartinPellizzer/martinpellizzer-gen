    "intro": "Selaginella glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is native to arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern ally that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in crevices or on cliffs. The plant features whorled leaves that are usually less than 1 inch long, with a dark green to bluish-green coloration. It produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of the stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Selaginella glaziovii is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
