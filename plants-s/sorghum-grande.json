    "intro": "Sorghum grande, commonly known as giant sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, elongated leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers, which are typically pale green to purple in color. Sorghum grande is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often cultivated for its high biomass yield. Its fibrous stalks are used in various agricultural and industrial applications, including the production of paper and textiles."
