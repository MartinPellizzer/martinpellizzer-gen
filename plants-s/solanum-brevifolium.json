    "intro": "Solanum brevifolium, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a small shrub native to South America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are often mistaken for edible fruits due to their appearance. Solanum brevifolium is often found in rocky or arid environments and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions."
