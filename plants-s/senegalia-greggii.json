    "intro": "Senegalia greggii, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought. Senegalia greggii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
