    "intro": "Spiraea pumila, commonly known as dwarf spiraea, is a small deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes. Spiraea pumila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
