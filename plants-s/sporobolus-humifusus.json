    "intro": "Sporobolus humifusus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Sporobolus humifusus is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
