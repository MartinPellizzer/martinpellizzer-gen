    "intro": "Stipa setacea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical form of *S. setacea*. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, silver-gray seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
