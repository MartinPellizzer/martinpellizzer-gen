    "intro": "Saxifraga sibthorpii, commonly known as the Tibetan saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Saxifraga sibthorpii is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of resilience in harsh mountainous regions."
