    "intro": "Salix ludlowiana, commonly known as Ludlow's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. This shrub or small tree typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
