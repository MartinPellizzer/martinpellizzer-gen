    "intro": "Stylidium kalbarriense, commonly known as the Kalbarri stickless orchid, is a small, perennial herb native to the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces a single, erect spike bearing several flowers, each with a short, spurred labellum. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
