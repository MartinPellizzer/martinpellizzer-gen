It features a dense, rounded crown with large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Schefflera laxiflora is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
