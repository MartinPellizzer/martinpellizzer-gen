    "intro": "Sophora tiloebsis, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
