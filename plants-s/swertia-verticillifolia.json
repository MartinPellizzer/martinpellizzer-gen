    "intro": "Swertia verticillifolia, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stems and basal leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Swertia verticillifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories and mountain meadows. Its medicinal properties have been explored in traditional medicine, though further research is needed to validate its therapeutic potential."
