    "intro": "Staberoha remota, commonly known as the distant-stemmed fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its fronds, which are typically hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are typically a deep green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Staberoha remota is considered a vulnerable species."
