    "intro": "Scleria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Scleria calcicola is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
