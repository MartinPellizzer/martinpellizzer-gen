    "intro": "Sempervivum flagelliferum, commonly known as the Woolly Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Sempervivum flagelliferum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
