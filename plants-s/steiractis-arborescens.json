    "intro": "Steiractis arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like sea anemone, is a unique marine organism that exhibits a plant-like appearance. It belongs to the order Actinioidea and is characterized by its branching, tree-like structure composed of delicate, translucent polyps. The plant-like form is an adaptation to its sessile lifestyle, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates in shallow coastal waters. Its reproductive system involves both sexual and asexual methods, contributing to its distribution along rocky shores. Despite its appearance, it is not a true plant but a cnidarian, closely related to corals and jellyfish."
