    "intro": "Saguaster, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in clusters. Saguaster has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Its foliage and flowers are used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for their purported healing properties."
