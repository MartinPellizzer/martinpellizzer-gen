    "intro": "Sorbus melanocarpa var. subpubescens, commonly known as the black mountain ash, is a variant of the mountain ash species native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which give way to orange-red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
