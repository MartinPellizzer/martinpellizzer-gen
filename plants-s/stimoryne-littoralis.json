    "intro": "Stimoryne littoralis, commonly known as the coastal stimoryne, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating saline conditions and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid or windy habitats. Stimoryne littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
