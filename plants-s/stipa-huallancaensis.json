    "intro": "Stipa huallancaensis, commonly known as the Huallcana grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Stipa huallancaensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
