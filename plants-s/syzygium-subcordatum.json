    "intro": "Syzygium subcordatum, commonly known as the purple-leafed tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn a striking purple color when exposed to full sun. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, pod-like fruits containing a sweet, acidic pulp. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Syzygium subcordatum is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its edible fruits in tropical gardens."
