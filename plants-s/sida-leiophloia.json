    "intro": "Sida leiophloia, commonly known as silky sida, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom from late spring to early summer. Sida leiophloia is often found in disturbed sites and is considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
