    "intro": "Stipa eminens subsp. andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and steppe habitats."
