    "intro": "Sorbus rufoferruginea, commonly known as the red-ironwood or rusty rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rough, dark bark that often has a reddish or iron-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. Sorbus rufoferruginea is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
