    "intro": "Salsola verrucosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is a shrub or perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or steppe environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain water in harsh, dry conditions. Salsola verrucosa is often used in traditional medicine and can also be a source of forage for livestock in certain regions."
