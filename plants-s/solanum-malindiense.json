    "intro": "Solanum malindiense, commonly known as the Malindi nightshade, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, ovate leaves, and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night. Its fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
