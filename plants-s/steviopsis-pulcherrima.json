    "intro": "Steviopsis pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvetleaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it distinct from other members of the Stevia genus, which are more commonly known for their use in herbal teas."
