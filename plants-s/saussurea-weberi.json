    "intro": "Saussurea weberi, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, achene-like seeds. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ecological significance and medicinal potential, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
