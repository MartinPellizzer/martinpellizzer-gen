It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Its leaves are often folded in a V-shape, giving it the common name \"hookedleaf.\" Sericocarpus tortifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
