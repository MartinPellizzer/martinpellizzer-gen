    "intro": "Scabiosa lachnophylla, commonly known as the woolly scabious, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scabiosa lachnophylla is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
