    "intro": "Scandix pectiniformis, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence. Native to South America, this plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The flowers are small and white, arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which attracts various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
