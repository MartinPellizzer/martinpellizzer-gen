    "intro": "Scaevola menziesiana, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Scaevola menziesiana is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
