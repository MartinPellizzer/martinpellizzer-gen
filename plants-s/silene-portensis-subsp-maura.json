    "intro": "Silene portensis subsp. maura, commonly known as the Maura catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
