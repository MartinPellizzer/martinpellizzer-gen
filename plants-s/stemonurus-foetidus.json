    "intro": "Stemonurus foetidus, commonly known as the stinking stemless rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has long, slender stems that are often leafless, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Despite its unpleasant odor, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates."
