    "intro": "Stolzia moniliformis, commonly known as the silverleaf stolzia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its foliage is covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stolzia moniliformis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
