    "intro": "Schrankia hystricina, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Schrankia hystricina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in disturbed or dry environments."
