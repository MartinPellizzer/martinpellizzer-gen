    "intro": "Stratiotes ensiformis, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a water-loving perennial that thrives in shallow freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves, which are typically bright green and float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetlands and ponds. Stratiotes ensiformis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
