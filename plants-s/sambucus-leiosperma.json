    "intro": "Sambucus leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible when fully ripe, though they are typically consumed in processed forms. Sambucus leiosperma is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its ecological importance includes providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
