    "intro": "Sorbus munda, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species but not for humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. Sorbus munda is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
