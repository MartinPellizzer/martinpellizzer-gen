    "intro": "Schizocodon ilicifolius var. ilicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, holly-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark, wrinkled berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
