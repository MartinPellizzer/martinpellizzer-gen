It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain toxic seeds, which contain the alkaloids strychnine and brucine. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its seeds."
