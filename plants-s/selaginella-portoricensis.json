    "intro": "Selaginella portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and reproductive features make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages. Selaginella portoricensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
