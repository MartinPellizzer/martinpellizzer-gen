It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, cold climates."
