    "intro": "Stratiotes generalis, commonly known as the broadleaf water clover, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has floating leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse via water. Stratiotes generalis is often used in pond ecosystems for its ability to provide habitat and improve water quality."
