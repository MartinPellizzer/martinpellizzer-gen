    "intro": "Selaginella pumila var. ramosa, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, low-growing fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, thread-like stems that branch out into clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. This variety is distinguished by its more branched growth pattern compared to the typical form of S. pumila."
