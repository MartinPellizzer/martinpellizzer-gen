    "intro": "Spermacoce pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific spurred grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
