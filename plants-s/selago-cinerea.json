    "intro": "Selago cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf selago, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Selago cinerea is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
