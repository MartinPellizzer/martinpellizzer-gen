    "intro": "Salvia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal practices for their aromatic and medicinal properties. Salvia pachyphylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
