    "intro": "Stipa saltensis, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Stipa saltensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
