    "intro": "Sedum decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions. It features fleshy, spreading stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Sedum decumbens is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
