    "intro": "Sphaeranthus randii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with small, spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. Sphaeranthus randii is well-suited to harsh conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
