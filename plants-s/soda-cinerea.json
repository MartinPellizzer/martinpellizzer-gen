    "intro": "Soda cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf soda, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that reflect sunlight and contribute to its drought tolerance. Soda cinerea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
