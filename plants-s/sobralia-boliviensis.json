    "intro": "Sobralia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian Sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and supports epiphytic growth. Its flowers are typically red or orange, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, tubular shape. Sobralia boliviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
