    "intro": "Sorbus domestica var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries that ripen in late summer. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in rocky or dry soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
