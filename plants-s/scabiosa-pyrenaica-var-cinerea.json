    "intro": "Scabiosa pyrenaica var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps to deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
