    "intro": "Sedum marnieri, commonly known as the mossy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
