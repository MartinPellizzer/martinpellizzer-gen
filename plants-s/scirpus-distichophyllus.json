    "intro": "Scirpus distichophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikes of flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct two-ranked arrangement of foliage. Scirpus distichophyllus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
