    "intro": "Styphelia behrii, commonly known as the Behri's wintergreen, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a compact rosette pattern, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Styphelia behrii thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal environments."
