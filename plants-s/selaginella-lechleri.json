    "intro": "Selaginella lechleri, commonly known as the \"bloodroot\" or \"sangre de drago,\" is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its spore-producing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its unique appearance. Selaginella lechleri is also notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for various health purposes."
