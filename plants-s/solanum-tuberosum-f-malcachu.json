    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. malcachu, commonly known as the Malcachu potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique foliage and tuber morphology, which distinguish it from standard Solanum tuberosum varieties. The plant typically exhibits a more compact growth habit with darker, more robust leaves. Its tubers often display a range of colors, including purple and red, adding to its ornamental value. This form is appreciated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and potential for genetic diversity in potato breeding programs."
