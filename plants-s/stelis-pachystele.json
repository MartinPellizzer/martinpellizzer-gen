    "intro": "Stelis pachystele, commonly known as the thick-stemmed stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and horticulturists."
