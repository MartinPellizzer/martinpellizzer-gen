    "intro": "Stauropsis kusukusensis, commonly known as the Kusukus Island spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It has adapted to the arid and nutrient-poor conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
