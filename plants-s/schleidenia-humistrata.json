    "intro": "Schleidenia humistrata, commonly known as the swamp spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive thallus structure with a central axis and lateral branches, typical of the Marchantiopsida subclass. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its entire surface. It is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid regions. Schleidenia humistrata plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
