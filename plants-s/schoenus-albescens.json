    "intro": "Schoenus albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of white wax. Schoenus albescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
