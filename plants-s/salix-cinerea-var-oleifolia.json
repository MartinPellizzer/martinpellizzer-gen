    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. oleifolia, commonly known as the greasy willow, is a variant of the grey willow native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
