    "intro": "Sigmatostalix adelaidae, commonly known as the Adelaide glorybower, is a flowering plant native to South Australia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their shape and nectar-rich nature. Sigmatostalix adelaidae is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
