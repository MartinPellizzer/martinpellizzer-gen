    "intro": "Stapelia irrorata, commonly known as the \"Cape Town flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often reddish or orange-colored flowers that resemble a star or a crown. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and are produced in late summer or early autumn. Stapelia irrorata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
