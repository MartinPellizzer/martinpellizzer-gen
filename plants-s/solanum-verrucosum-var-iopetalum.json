    "intro": "Solanum verrucosum var. iopetalum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features hairy, glandular leaves that are often tinged with purple, and its stems are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
