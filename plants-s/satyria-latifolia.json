    "intro": "Satyria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf satyria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture."
