    "intro": "Schoenocaulon frameae, commonly known as the Hawaiian star-moss, is a unique and rare plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the family Pterostellaria, characterized by its dense, star-shaped clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of rainforests. Its botanical structure is adapted to retain moisture and withstand the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
