    "intro": "Sisymbrium serratum, commonly known as the serrated broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having scale-like structures, and relies on parasitic relationships with host plants for nutrient uptake. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Sisymbrium serratum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
