    "intro": "Scoliosorus, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, fern-like fronds that often display a zigzag pattern along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually small and delicate, with a velvety texture. Scoliosorus species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic."
