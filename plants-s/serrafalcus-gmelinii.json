    "intro": "Serrafalcus gmelinii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be used for various traditional purposes. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and as an ornamental plant."
