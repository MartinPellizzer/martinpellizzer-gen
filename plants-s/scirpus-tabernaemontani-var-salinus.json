    "intro": "Scirpus tabernaemontani var. salinus, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in saline or brackish environments. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers that mature into brown, fluffy seeds. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal areas. This plant is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species."
