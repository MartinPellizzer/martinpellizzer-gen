It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant's leaves are ovate with serrated edges and often have a fuzzy texture. After flowering, it develops small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature.
