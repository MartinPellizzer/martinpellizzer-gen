    "intro": "Solidago odora var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the sweet goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabriuscula has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland landscapes."
