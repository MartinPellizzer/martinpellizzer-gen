    "intro": "Sida lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindenhall sida, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the dry season. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Sida lindeniana is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
