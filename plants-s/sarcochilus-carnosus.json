    "intro": "Sarcochilus carnosus, commonly known as the fat-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring and summer months. Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Sarcochilus carnosus is a hardy species that thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
