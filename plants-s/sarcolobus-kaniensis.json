    "intro": "Sarcolobus kaniensis, commonly known as the Kaniensis bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Sarcolobus kaniensis is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments."
