    "intro": "Silene cucubalus subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bladderpod, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal across suitable habitats."
