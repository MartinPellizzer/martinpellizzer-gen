    "intro": "Silene muscipula var. oranensis, commonly known as the Oranese bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, a feature typical of the genus Silene. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
