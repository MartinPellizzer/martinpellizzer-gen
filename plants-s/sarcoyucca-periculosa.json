    "intro": "Sarcoyucca periculosa, commonly known as the deadly yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating. The plant produces large, showy white or yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in ornamental gardening and requires careful handling."
