    "intro": "Synactila, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and their intricate, spider-like flower structures. Synactila species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. They have specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths."
