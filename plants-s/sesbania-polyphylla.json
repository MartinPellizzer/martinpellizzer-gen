    "intro": "Sesbania polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which can have multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Sesbania polyphylla is also valued in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties."
