    "intro": "Solanum microdontum var. montepuncoense, commonly known as the Montepuncense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
