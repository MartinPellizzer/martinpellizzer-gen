    "intro": "Sphaeropteris alternans, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, curved fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a robust rhizome system and produces large, compound leaves with a serrated margin. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. Sphaeropteris alternans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, shaded environments."
