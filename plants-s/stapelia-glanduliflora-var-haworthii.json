    "intro": "Stapelia glanduliflora var. haworthii, commonly known as the Haworth's Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. This species is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
