    "intro": "Synnema prunelloides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
