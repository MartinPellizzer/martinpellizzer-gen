    "intro": "Silene nocturna var. brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petalled evening pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom at night. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cooler, high-altitude environments where it thrives. This variant is distinguished by its shorter petals compared to the typical form of Silene nocturna. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
