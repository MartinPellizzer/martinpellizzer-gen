    "intro": "Sedum baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, which helps reduce water loss. Sedum baeticum is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
