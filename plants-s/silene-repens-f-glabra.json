    "intro": "Silene repens f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth stammering catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, usually in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is notable for its simplicity in appearance and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
