    "intro": "Symplocos lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Symplocos lanceifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and native plant collections."
