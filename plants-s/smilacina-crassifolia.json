    "intro": "Smilacina crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf greenbriar, is a woody vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its berries, which are yellowish and toxic, mature in the fall and are dispersed by birds. Smilacina crassifolia thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in forest understories."
