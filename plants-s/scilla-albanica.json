    "intro": "Scilla albanica, commonly known as the Albanian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Scilla albanica prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and early blooming habit."
