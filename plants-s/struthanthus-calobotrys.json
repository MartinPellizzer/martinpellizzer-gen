    "intro": "Struthanthus calobotrys, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its compact, woody stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color, blooming at night to attract specific pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, contributing to its dispersal in dry, disturbed habitats. Struthanthus calobotrys is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water and nutrient availability."
