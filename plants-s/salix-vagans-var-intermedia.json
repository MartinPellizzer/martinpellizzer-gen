    "intro": "Salix vagans var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, arching branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous terrains."
