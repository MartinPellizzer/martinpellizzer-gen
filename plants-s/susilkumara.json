The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and slightly curled at the edges, providing a lush green contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Susilkumara is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in botanical gardens and private collections."
