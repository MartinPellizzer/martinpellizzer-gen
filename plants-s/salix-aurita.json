    "intro": "Salix aurita, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies. Salix aurita is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and provide habitat for wildlife."
