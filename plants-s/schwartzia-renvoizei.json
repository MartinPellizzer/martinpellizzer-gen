It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forest environments, where it thrives in the shade of taller trees. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its rarity and the demand for its wood, Schwartzia renvoizei is critically endangered and faces significant conservation challenges."
