    "intro": "Salvia acuminatissima, commonly known as the Mexican mint or narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
