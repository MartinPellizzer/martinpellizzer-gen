    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. montanensis, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant with a rosette of fleshy, scale-like leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain spores for reproduction. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and thrives in full sun. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native habitat."
