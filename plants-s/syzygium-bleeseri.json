It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarind. Syzygium bleeseri is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
