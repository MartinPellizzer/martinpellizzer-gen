    "intro": "Selaginella rothertii, commonly known as the Hart's tongue fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery leaves that resemble a tongue, which are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This plant is a spore-bearing species, reproducing through the production of microspores and megaspores rather than seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Selaginella rothertii is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
