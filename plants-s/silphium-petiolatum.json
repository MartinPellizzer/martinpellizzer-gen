It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite leaves that are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in late summer. Silphium petiolatum is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It is also known for its historical use by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes."
