    "intro": "Secale montanum var. balcanum, commonly known as the Balkan ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
