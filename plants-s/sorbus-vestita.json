    "intro": "Sorbus vestita, commonly known as the white-tailed mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in the autumn before falling."
