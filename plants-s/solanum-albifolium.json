    "intro": "Solanum albifolium, commonly known as the white-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically white or pale green, distinguishing it from other nightshade species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. Solanum albifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks."
