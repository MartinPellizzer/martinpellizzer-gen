    "intro": "Stenosolenium, commonly known as the string of pearls plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and easy care requirements. Stenosolenium prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
