    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features rosettes of ovate, hairy, and often reddish leaves that are adapted to cold, rocky environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous and subalpine habitats. Saxifraga hirculus subsp. alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
