    "intro": "Salix cordata var. denveriana, commonly known as the Denver weeping willow, is a cultivar of the weeping willow tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often fuzzy underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful form and adaptability to various soil conditions."
