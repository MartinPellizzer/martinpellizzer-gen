    "intro": "Stelis mammillata, commonly known as the mammillate stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, or mammillate, stems that give it its common name. The plant typically produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis mammillata is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
