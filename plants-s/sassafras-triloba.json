    "intro": "Sassafras triloba, commonly known as southern sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species. Its roots and leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Sassafras triloba thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
