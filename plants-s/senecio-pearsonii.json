    "intro": "Senecio pearsonii, commonly known as the Pearson's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
