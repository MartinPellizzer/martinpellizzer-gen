    "intro": "Selaginella aristata var. kaudernii, commonly known as the Kaudern's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to South America. It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
