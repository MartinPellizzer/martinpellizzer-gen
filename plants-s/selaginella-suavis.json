    "intro": "Selaginella suavis, commonly known as the sweet spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in moist, shaded environments. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant with a rosette-like structure composed of closely spaced, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically green and may have a faintly aromatic scent. Selaginella suavis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
