    "intro": "Stellaria axillaris, commonly known as the lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Stellaria axillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
