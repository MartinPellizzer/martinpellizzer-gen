    "intro": "Salix paludicola, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
