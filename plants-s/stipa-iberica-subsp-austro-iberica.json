    "intro": "Stipa iberica subsp. austro-iberica, commonly known as the Iberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Spain and northern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
