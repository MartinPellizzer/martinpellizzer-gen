    "intro": "Schefflera versteegii, commonly known as the African evergreen, is a tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like cluster of leaves, which gives it a unique and compact appearance. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a radiating pattern around a central stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. Schefflera versteegii is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its relatively slow growth rate."
