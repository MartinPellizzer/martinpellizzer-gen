    "intro": "Stylosanthes dissitiflora, commonly known as the hairy stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Stylosanthes dissitiflora is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used as a forage crop in arid environments. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it valuable for soil improvement and sustainable agriculture."
