    "intro": "Scandix pecten-veneris var. brevistyla, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble the shell of the Venus' flower basket. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scandix pecten-veneris var. brevistyla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal climates."
