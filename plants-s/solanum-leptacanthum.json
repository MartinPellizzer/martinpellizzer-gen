    "intro": "Solanum leptacanthum, commonly known as the slender-fruited nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant features small, egg-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for human consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
