    "intro": "Stelis luteola, commonly known as the yellow stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in racemes, and are typically fragrant. Stelis luteola is appreciated for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic appeal."
