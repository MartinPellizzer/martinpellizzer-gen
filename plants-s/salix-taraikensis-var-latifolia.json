    "intro": "Salix taraikensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and it is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
