    "intro": "Solanum depressum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Solanum depressum contains alkaloids and is considered toxic, though it has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
