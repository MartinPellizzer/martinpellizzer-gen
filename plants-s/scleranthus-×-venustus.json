It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces bract-like leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves, and its fruits are small, three-lobed achenes. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
