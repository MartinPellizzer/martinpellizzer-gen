It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in desert and coastal environments. Salsola moquiniana is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution and ecological impact."
