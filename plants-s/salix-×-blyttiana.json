    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 blyttiana, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix fragilis (crack willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive cascading branches. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and ponds. The plant produces small catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal."
