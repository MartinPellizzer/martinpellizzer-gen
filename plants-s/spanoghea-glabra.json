    "intro": "Spanoghea glabra, commonly known as the smooth spanoghea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, smooth hairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Spanoghea glabra is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
