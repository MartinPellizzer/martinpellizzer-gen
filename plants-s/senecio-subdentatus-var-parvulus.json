    "intro": "Senecio subdentatus var. parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf Senecio or small-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry garden settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
