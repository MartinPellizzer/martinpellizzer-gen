    "intro": "Salix purpurea f. furcata, commonly known as the purple willow with forked branches, is a unique variant of the purple willow. It is characterized by its distinctive forked branches, which give it a striking appearance. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically found in wetland environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a silvery-green underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators."
