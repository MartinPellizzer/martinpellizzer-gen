    "intro": "Stichorkis cyclostele, commonly known as the cyclostele fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Stichophylleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, circular arrangement of leaflets, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive. Its fronds are often divided into numerous small, linear segments, contributing to its intricate appearance. The reproductive structures, including spore-producing organs, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
