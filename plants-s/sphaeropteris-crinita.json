    "intro": "Sphaeropteris crinita, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the cycad family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The leaves are typically arched and have a distinctive hairy texture, giving the plant its common name. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
