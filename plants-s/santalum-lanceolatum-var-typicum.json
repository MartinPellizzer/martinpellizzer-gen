    "intro": "Santalum lanceolatum var. typicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, aromatic wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
