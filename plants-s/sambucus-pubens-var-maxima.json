    "intro": "Sambucus pubens var. maxima, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when underdeveloped. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
