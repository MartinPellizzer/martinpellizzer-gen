    "intro": "Salix rhododendroides, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many willow species. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Salix rhododendroides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats and riparian zones."
