    "intro": "Securidaca flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often twisting stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and have a distinctive zigzag appearance due to the folded leaflets. Securidaca flexuosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
