    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 membranacea, commonly known as the silky willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and finely toothed leaves that are covered in a silky, white pubescence. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The silky willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
