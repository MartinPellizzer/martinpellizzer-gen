    "intro": "Sorbus amurensis, commonly known as Amur whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by white to pink berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler regions."
