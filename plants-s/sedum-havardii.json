    "intro": "Sedum havardii, commonly known as the Har vard's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum havardii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
