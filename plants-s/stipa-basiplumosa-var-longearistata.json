    "intro": "Stipa basiplumosa var. longearistata, commonly known as the long-haired bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive, slender spikelets that are often adorned with long, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like foliage."
