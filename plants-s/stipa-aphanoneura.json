    "intro": "Stipa aphanoneura, commonly known as the ghost grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa aphanoneura thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its low-growing habit and unique appearance make it a distinctive component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
