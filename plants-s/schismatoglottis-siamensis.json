    "intro": "Schismatoglottis siamensis, commonly known as the Siam arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces showy, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which are often borne on erect stems. Schismatoglottis siamensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
