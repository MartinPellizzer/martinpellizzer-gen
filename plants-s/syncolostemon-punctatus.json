    "intro": "Syncolostemon punctatus, commonly known as the spotted synnema, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It features hairy, succulent stems and leaves with a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
