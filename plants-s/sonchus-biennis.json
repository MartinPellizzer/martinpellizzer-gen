    "intro": "Sonchus biennis, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of finely divided, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Sonchus biennis is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
