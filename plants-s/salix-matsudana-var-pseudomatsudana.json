It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, brown fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
