    "intro": "Salicornia fruticosa var. macrostachya, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
