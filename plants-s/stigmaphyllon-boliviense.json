It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. It produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
