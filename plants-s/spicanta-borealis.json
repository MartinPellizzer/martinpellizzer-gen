    "intro": "Spicanta borealis, commonly known as the northern thornvine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic tundra regions of northern Europe and North America. It features slender, erect stems covered in small, sharp spines, which help protect it from herbivores in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Spicanta borealis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing food for specialized insect pollinators."
