It features wiry, branched stems that grow up to 30\u201360 cm in height, often adorned with small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers with five petals, resembling small, delicate butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine beds.
