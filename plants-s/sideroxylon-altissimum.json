    "intro": "Sideroxylon altissimum, commonly known as the tall ironwood tree, is a species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant typically grows as a tall, straight tree with smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often threatened by deforestation and habitat loss."
