    "intro": "Solidago radula var. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated leaves compared to other goldenrod species."
