    "intro": "Siphantheropsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in humid environments. Siphantheropsis species are known for their intricate, lace-like leaf structures and their ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions. These ferns are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
