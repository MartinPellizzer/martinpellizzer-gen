    "intro": "Senecio pammicrocephalus, commonly known as the dwarf senecio, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, daisy-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a succulent specimen."
