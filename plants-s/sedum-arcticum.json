    "intro": "Sedum arcticum, commonly known as Arctic sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the short summer season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Sedum arcticum is a hardy perennial that plays an important role in stabilizing tundra ecosystems."
