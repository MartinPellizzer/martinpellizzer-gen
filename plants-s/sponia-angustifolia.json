    "intro": "Sponia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sponia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Sponia angustifolia prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit and ornamental foliage."
