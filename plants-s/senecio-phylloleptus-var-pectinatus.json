It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
