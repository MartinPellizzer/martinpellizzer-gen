    "intro": "Stellera bodinieri, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that form a dense, low-growing structure. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Stellera bodinieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
