    "intro": "Streblosa microcarpa var. enotata, commonly known as the narrow-fruit sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent stems that store water, aiding in survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
