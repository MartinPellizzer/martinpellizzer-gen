    "intro": "Stereoxylon rubrum, commonly known as the redwood tree, is a species of coniferous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon in the United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and thick, reddish-brown bark that provides protection against fire and pests. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dense and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in temperate rainforest conditions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Stereoxylon rubrum plays a vital role in its ecosystem, offering habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to soil stabilization through its extensive root system."
