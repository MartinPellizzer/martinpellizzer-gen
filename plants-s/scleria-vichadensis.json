    "intro": "Scleria vichadensis, commonly known as the Vichada sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly found in the Amazonian region of Colombia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered inflorescences, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
