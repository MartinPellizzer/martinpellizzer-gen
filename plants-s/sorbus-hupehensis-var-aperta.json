    "intro": "Sorbus hupehensis var. aperta, commonly known as the Chinese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall."
