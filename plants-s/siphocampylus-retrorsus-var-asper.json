    "intro": "Siphocampylus retrorsus var. asper, commonly known as the roughleaf siphocampylus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
