    "intro": "Selaginella cyclophylla, commonly known as the wheel-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces sporophytes that are short and stout, with a single, erect stem topped by a cluster of spirally arranged leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Selaginella cyclophylla is an important component of the undergrowth in various Australian ecosystems."
