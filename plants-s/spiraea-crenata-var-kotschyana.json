    "intro": "Spiraea crenata var. kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschyana spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white, fluffy flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
