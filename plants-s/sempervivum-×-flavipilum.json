    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 flavipilum, commonly known as the golden hens and chicks, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the Alps. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that range in color from green to yellow and orange, depending on light exposure. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" which can be separated and grown independently. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
