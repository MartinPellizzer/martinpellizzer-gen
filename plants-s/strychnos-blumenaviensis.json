    "intro": "Strychnos blumenaviensis, commonly known as the Blumenau strychnos, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright orange berries. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany. However, it is important to note that some species within the genus Strychnos contain toxic alkaloids, though the specific toxicity of S. blumenaviensis is less well-documented."
