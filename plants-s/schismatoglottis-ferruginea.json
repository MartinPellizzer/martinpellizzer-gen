    "intro": "Schismatoglottis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty schismatoglottis, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It features rhizomatous growth and produces small, pale green to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
