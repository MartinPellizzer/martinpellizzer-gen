    "intro": "Scabiosa leucanthema, commonly known as white scabious, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. White scabious is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
