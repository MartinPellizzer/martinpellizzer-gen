    "intro": "Siapaea liesneri, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a small perennial herb belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with densely packed, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-suited for drought conditions."
