    "intro": "Selaginella nemorosa, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, spore-bearing structures called strobila. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Its morphology includes both upright and creeping stems, with spirally arranged leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
