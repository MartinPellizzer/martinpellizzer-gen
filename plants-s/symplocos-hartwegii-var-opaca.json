It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant landscapes."
