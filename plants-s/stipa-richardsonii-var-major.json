    "intro": "Stipa richardsonii var. major, commonly known as the giant needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is an important component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
