    "intro": "Scilla stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and woodland settings. Scilla stenophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates."
