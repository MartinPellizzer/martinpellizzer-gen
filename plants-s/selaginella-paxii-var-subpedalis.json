    "intro": "Selaginella paxii var. subpedalis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its stems. The plant produces sporophytes with spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is noted for its unique morphological features and is of interest in botanical studies due to its evolutionary significance."
