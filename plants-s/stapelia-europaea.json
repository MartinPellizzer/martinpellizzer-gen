    "intro": "Stapelia europaea, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Stapelia europaea is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
