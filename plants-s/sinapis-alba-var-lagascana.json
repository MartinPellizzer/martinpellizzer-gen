It features a branched stem covered in fine hairs, with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by spherical, three-lobed pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. Its rapid growth and early maturation make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
