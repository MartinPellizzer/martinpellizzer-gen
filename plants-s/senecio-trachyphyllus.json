    "intro": "Senecio trachyphyllus, commonly known as the roughleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features hairy, often reddish stems and leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, rough texture. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
