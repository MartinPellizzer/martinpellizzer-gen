    "intro": "Siphocampylus glandulosus var. ovatus, commonly known as the woolly bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive and relatively easy-to-grow plant for gardens and conservation efforts."
