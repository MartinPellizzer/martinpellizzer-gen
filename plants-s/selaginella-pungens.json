It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its lance-shaped leaves and clustered, cone-like structures that produce spores. Selaginella pungens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its unique reproductive structures and ancient lineage make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
