    "intro": "Solanum mesopliarthrum, commonly known as the Mesopliarthrum nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while the fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns from green to red as it matures. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
