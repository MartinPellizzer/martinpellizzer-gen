    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides var. pungens, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky and barren environments, often found on tundra and alpine slopes. The plant features dense, woolly leaves that help insulate it from extreme cold and reduce water loss. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its harsh habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly prickly leaves, which provide additional protection against herbivores."
