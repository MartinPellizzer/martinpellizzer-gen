    "intro": "Smilax peduncularis, commonly known as the climbing smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features spiny stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its toxic berries and sharp thorns make it both a challenging and notable botanical specimen."
