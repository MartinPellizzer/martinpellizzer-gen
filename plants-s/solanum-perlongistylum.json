    "intro": "Solanum perlongistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant is characterized by its elongated stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe, contain toxic compounds and are not edible. Due to its restricted habitat and limited genetic diversity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
