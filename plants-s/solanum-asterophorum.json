    "intro": "Solanum asterophorum, commonly known as the ghost flower or death flower, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep violet, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a bright red, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its toxicity and rare occurrence, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
