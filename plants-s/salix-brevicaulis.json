    "intro": "Salix brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stem willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same inflorescence. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found near streams or in boggy areas. Salix brevicaulis is an important species for ecological stability in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
