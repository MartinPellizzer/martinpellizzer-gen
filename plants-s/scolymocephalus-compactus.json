    "intro": "Scolymocephalus compactus, commonly known as the compact scolymus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, compact foliage and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant features a fibrous root system and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Scolymocephalus compactus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
