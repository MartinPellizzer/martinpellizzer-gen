    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. murale, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to tolerate poor soil conditions and withstand drought."
