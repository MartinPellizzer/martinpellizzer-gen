    "intro": "Sericographis lineolata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Sericographis lineolata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
