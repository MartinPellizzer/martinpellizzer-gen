    "intro": "Salix baileyi, commonly known as the Bailey willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and wetlands. Salix baileyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize streambanks."
