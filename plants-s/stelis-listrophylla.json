It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green flowers with a distinctive white or pale pink coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
