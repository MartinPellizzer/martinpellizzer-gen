    "intro": "Seguieria mammifera, commonly known as the mammillary cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its structure includes spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. Seguieria mammifera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
