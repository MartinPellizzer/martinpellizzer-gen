It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
