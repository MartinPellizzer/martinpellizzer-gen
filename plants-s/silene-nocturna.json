    "intro": "Silene nocturna, commonly known as the night-flowering catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-purple flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and has fleshy, hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve moisture. Its flowers have a distinctive, sweet scent that becomes more pronounced in the evening. Silene nocturna is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
