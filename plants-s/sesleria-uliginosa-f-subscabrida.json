    "intro": "Sesleria uliginosa f. subscabrida, commonly known as the bog sesleria, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of western Europe. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly rough texture, which is a distinguishing feature of the subscabrida form. This variety thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and heathlands."
