    "intro": "Scleranthus myrianthus, commonly known as the many-flowered sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming from late summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Scleranthus myrianthus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in disturbed or open habitats."
