It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which allows it to thrive in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that nod towards the ground, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. This plant is known for its adaptability and can become invasive in certain environments."
