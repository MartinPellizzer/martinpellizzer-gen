    "intro": "Scutellaria mississipiana, commonly known as the Mississippi skullcap, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
