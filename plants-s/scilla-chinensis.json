    "intro": "Scilla chinensis, commonly known as Chinese squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to East Asia. It produces striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and ability to naturalize over time."
