    "intro": "Sonchus elliotianus, commonly known as Elliot's sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, spiky achenes. Elliot's sowthistle is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for certain insects and birds."
