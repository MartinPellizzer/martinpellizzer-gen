    "intro": "Schizaea rhacoindusiata, commonly known as the Indian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves and produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Schizaea rhacoindusiata is characterized by its unique morphology, including its branching pattern and the presence of rhizomes. This ancient plant is considered a relic of the Paleozoic era and plays a role in ecological succession in its native habitats."
