    "intro": "Sinapis alba var. mairei, commonly known as the white mustard, is a biennial or annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces slender, hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The plant is also valued for its use in agriculture as a cover crop and for its potential in phytoremediation."
