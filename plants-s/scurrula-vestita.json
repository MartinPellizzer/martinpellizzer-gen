    "intro": "Scurrula vestita, commonly known as the naked scurrula, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Scoliciosporaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically covered in a thin, powdery layer. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on decaying wood or bark in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and can serve as an indicator of air quality."
