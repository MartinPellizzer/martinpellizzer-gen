    "intro": "Solanum andinum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by edible berries that are typically red when mature. Solanum andinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities. However, like many members of its family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
