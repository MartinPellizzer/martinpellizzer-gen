    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. virgata, commonly known as the silver willow or white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth upper surface with a fuzzy underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies."
