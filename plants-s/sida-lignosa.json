    "intro": "Sida lignosa, commonly known as rough sida, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Sida lignosa is adapted to hot, dry conditions and is considered a drought-tolerant species."
