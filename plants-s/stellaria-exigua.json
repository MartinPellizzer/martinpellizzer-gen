    "intro": "Stellaria exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant features slender, branching stems and narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Stellaria exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
