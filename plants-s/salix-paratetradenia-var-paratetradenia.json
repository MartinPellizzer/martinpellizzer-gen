    "intro": "Salix paratetradenia var. paratetradenia, commonly known as the Paratetradenia willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin and a pale green underside. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges."
