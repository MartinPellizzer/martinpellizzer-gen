    "intro": "Sophia sophia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its flowers bloom in vibrant shades of pink and white. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater. Its flowers open at dawn and close at sunset, a process known as nyctinasty. The sacred lotus is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and medicinal properties."
