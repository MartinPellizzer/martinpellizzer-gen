    "intro": "Selaginella neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia spikemoss, is a tropical fern-like plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and fire, due to its desiccation-tolerant spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into ancient plant evolution and adaptation."
