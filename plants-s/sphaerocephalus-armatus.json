    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus armatus, commonly known as the globe-headed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, globular inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered around the central swelling. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
