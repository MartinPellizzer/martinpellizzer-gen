It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use in suitable climates.
