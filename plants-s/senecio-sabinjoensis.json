    "intro": "Senecio sabinjoensis, commonly known as the Sabinjo's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
