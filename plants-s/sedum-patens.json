    "intro": "Sedum patens, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum patens is also known for its hardiness and ability to survive in arid conditions."
