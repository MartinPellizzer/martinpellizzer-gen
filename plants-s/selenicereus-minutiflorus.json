It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are usually small and often shed during the dry season. Selenicereus minutiflorus is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
