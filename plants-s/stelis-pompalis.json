    "intro": "Stelis pompalis, commonly known as the showy stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Stelis pompalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
