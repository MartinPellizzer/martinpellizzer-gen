    "intro": "Strophanthus petersianus var. amboensis, commonly known as the African milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically opposite and pinnate. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. It is often used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to its potent chemical composition."
