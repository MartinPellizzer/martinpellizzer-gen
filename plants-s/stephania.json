    "intro": "Stephania, commonly known as the Chinese herb \"Fang Ji,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Menispermaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or vines, characterized by their alternate, simple, and often palmately lobed leaves. Stephania species are native to Asia, particularly China, and some are also found in Africa and the Americas. They produce small, greenish flowers that are usually clustered in umbels, followed by berries that contain the seeds. The roots and rhizomes of certain Stephania species are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
