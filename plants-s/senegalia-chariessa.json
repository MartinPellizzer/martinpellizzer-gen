    "intro": "Senegalia chariessa, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of small, feather-like leaflets, and it is adapted to survive in drought conditions. Senegalia chariessa is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock."
