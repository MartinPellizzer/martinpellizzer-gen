    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea subsp. venosa, commonly known as the purple swamp pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant's flowers are typically pink or red, with a unique, spurred structure that aids in pollination. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its subspecies status highlights its genetic and morphological differences from the main species, S. purpurea."
