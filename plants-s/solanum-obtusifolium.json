    "intro": "Solanum obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark blue or black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
