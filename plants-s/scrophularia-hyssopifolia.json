    "intro": "Scrophularia hyssopifolia, commonly known as purple marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing violet to purple blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is valued in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties."
