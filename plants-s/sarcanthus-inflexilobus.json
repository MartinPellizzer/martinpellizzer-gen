    "intro": "Sarcanthus inflexilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed sarcanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its small, palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
