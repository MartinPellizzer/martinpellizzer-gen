    "intro": "Stipa pennata f. hispida, commonly known as the hairy false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a dense covering of stiff, bristly hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
