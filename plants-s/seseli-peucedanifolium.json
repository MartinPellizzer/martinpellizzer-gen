It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils across Europe and western Asia. The plant features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
