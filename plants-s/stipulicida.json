    "intro": "Stipulicida, commonly known as the false cactus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cactaceae. It is characterized by its spiny stems and modified leaves that often appear as spines or bracts. The plants typically have a succulent structure, allowing them to store water in arid environments. Stipulicida species are native to South America, particularly in regions with dry climates. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the plant."
