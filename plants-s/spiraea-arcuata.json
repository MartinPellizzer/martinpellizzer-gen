    "intro": "Spiraea arcuata, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features arching stems covered in small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Spiraea arcuata is often found in moist woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
