    "intro": "Salix omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
