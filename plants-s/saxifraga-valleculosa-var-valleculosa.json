    "intro": "Saxifraga valleculosa var. valleculosa, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to white, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover in horticultural settings."
