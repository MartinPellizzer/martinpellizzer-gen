It belongs to the Saururaceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers.

Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in natural habitats. Symplocarpus koreanus is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
