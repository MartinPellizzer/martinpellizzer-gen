    "intro": "Stephania renifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed stephania, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxicity, but it is studied for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
