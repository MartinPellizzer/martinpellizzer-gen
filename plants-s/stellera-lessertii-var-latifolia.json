    "intro": "Stellera lessertii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf stellera, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
