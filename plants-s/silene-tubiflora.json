    "intro": "Silene tubiflora, commonly known as the woolly catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Silene tubiflora is often found in dry, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gravelly areas. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like carnations and chickweed."
