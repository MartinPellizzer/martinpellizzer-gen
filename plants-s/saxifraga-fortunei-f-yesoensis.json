    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei f. yesoensis, commonly known as the Yeso saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
