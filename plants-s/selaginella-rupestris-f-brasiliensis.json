    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian wall moss, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. This plant is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. The plant's ability to survive in challenging conditions makes it an important component of certain ecosystems."
