    "intro": "Saxifraga subpeltata, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and ample sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
