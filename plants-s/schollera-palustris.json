    "intro": "Schollera palustris, commonly known as the marsh schollera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Schollera palustris is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate periods of submersion. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and supporting biodiversity."
