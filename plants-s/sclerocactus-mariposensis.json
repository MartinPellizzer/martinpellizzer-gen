    "intro": "Sclerocactus mariposensis, commonly known as the Mariposa cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the apex of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in arid gardens."
