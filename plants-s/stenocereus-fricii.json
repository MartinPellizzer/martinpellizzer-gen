    "intro": "Stenocereus fricii, commonly known as the Frici's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a spineless cactus that typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its dense, branching structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to survive in dry environments. Stenocereus fricii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh climates."
