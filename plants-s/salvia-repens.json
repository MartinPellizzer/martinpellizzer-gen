    "intro": "Salvia repens, commonly known as creeping sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are gray-green and aromatic, often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. Salvia repens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
