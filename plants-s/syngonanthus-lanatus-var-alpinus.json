    "intro": "Syngonanthus lanatus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs that cover its leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
