    "intro": "Salix hylonoma var. isochroma, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
