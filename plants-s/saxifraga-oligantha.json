    "intro": "Saxifraga oligantha, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense cushions or mats to withstand harsh conditions. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in early summer and attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Saxifraga oligantha is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude ecosystems."
