    "intro": "Stapelia tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Stapelia tubulosa is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
