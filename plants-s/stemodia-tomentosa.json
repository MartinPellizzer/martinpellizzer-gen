    "intro": "Stemodia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly stemodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, or tomentose, stems and leaves, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal regions. Stemodia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
