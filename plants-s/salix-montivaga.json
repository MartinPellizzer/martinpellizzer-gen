    "intro": "Salix montivaga, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas. Salix montivaga is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
