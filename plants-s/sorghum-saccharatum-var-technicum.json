    "intro": "Sorghum saccharatum var. technicum, commonly known as sweet sorghum, is a tall, drought-tolerant grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous stalks and clusters of small, purplish-pink flowers. The plant is cultivated for its high sugar content in the stalks, which can be processed into syrup or ethanol. Its leaves are also used as animal fodder, making it a versatile crop. Due to its adaptability, it thrives in warm climates and is often grown in regions with limited water resources."
