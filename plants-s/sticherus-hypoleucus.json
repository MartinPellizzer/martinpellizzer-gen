    "intro": "Sticherus hypoleucus, commonly known as the slender sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are often white or pale green in color. Sticherus hypoleucus is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its role in supporting local insect populations."
