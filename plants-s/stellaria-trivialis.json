    "intro": "Stellaria trivialis, commonly known as common chickweed, is a low-growing annual or biennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, slender leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along paths. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that allows it to colonize various habitats. Stellaria trivialis is also known for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
