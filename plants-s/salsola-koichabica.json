    "intro": "Salsola koichabica, commonly known as the Tibetan saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it highly resilient to harsh climatic conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soils in degraded or sandy areas. Salsola koichabica plays a role in preventing desertification and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
