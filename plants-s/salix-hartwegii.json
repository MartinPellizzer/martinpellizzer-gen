    "intro": "Salix hartwegii, commonly known as Hartweg's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. This shrub or small tree typically grows in moist, mountainous environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
