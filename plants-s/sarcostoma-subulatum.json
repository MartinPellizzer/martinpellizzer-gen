    "intro": "Sarcostoma subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf sarcostoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Sarcostoma subulatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
