    "intro": "Synnema anomalum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds. Synnema anomalum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
