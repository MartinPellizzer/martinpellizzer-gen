It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
