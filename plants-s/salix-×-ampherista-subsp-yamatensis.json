It is characterized by its slender, often weeping stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or streams. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to wetland environments."
