    "intro": "Sideroxylon acuminatum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and carving, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss. Sideroxylon acuminatum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
