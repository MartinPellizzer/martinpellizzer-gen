    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia floreochroleuco, commonly known as the white-leaf weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that create a weeping appearance, and its leaves are elliptical with a silvery-white underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators and birds."
