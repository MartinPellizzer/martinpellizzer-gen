    "intro": "Steriphoma paradoxum subsp. venezuelanum, commonly known as the Venezuelan starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Venezuela. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and limited geographic distribution."
