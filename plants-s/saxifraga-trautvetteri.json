    "intro": "Saxifraga trautvetteri, commonly known as the Trautvetter's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor soils. Saxifraga trautvetteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
