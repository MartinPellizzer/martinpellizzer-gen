    "intro": "Sabazia anomala, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the evening. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from underground sources. Sabazia anomala is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
