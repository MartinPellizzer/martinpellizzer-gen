    "intro": "Spiranthes gardneri, commonly known as Gardner's spiral orchid, is a delicate perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, bogs, and other moist habitats, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Gardner's spiral orchid is known for its subtle beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
