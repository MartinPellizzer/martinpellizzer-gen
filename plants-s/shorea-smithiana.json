    "intro": "Shorea smithiana, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, reaching heights of up to 40 meters. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
