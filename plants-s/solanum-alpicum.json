    "intro": "Solanum alpicum, commonly known as the alpine nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It typically grows in rocky and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features erect stems covered in glandular hairs and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. Its berries, which are edible when ripe, are often used in traditional medicine for their mild sedative properties. Solanum alpicum plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing food for various insect and bird species."
