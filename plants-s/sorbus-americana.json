    "intro": "Sorbus americana, commonly known as the American whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by orange to red berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks. The American whitebeam is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
