It features striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
