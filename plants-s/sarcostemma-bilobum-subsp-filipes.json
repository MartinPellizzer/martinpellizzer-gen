    "intro": "Sarcostemma bilobum subsp. filipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved devil's backbone, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves with a distinctive two-lobed base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in semi-arid to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
