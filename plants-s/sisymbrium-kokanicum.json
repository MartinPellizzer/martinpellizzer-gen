    "intro": "Sisymbrium kokanicum, commonly known as the Kokanica broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species for survival. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth and health of its host plants."
