It is characterized by its fragrant, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically elliptical, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the pale blooms. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain aromatic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
