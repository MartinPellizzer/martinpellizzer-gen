    "intro": "Symplocos coccinea var. benthamii, commonly known as the red beauty or redleaf inkberry, is a variant of the red inkberry plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its vibrant red leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with temperate climates."
