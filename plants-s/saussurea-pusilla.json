    "intro": "Saussurea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarfed saffron plant, is a small herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellowish to orange-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its small size and delicate appearance make it a unique addition to alpine flora. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in remote and less disturbed mountain environments."
