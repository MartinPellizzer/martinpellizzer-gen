    "intro": "Stipa dickorei, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spiky inflorescences that resemble a cluster of needles. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Stipa dickorei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
