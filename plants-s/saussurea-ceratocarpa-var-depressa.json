    "intro": "Saussurea ceratocarpa var. depressa, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically dense and hairy, providing insulation against the cold. This variant is notable for its medicinal uses in traditional Tibetan medicine."
