    "intro": "Senecio cliffordii, commonly known as cliff's senecio, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as cliffs and canyons, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Senecio cliffordii is often found in areas with specific microclimates that support its unique ecological requirements."
