    "intro": "Sisymbrium integrifolium, commonly known as the hoary vetch, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Sisymbrium integrifolium is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
