    "intro": "Solanum decorum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by egg-shaped berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
