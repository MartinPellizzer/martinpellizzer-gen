    "intro": "Salvia liguliloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Salvia liguliloba is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
