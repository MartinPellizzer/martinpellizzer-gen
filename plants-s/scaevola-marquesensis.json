    "intro": "Scaevola marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the tropical Pacific islands. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, brightly colored flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Scaevola marquesensis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in coastal regions of French Polynesia."
