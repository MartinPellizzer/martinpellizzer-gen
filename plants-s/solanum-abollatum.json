    "intro": "Solanum abollatum, commonly known as the broken tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, though they are not typically edible due to their bitter taste. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Solanum abollatum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
