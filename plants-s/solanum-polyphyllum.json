    "intro": "Solanum polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its clustered, hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum polyphyllum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
