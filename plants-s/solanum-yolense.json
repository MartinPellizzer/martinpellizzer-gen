    "intro": "Solanum yolense, commonly known as the Yol\u00e9n nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant of both ecological and potential medicinal interest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
