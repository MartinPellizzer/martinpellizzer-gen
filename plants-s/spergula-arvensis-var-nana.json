    "intro": "Spergula arvensis var. nana, commonly known as dwarf field sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a characteristic species of wetland habitats."
