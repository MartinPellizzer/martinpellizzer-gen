It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive purple tuberous roots, which are rich in starch. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often cultivated for its edible tubers. Solanum sycocarpum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Andean agriculture for centuries."
