    "intro": "Salix margaritifera, commonly known as the pearl willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or unstable environments."
