    "intro": "Stapelia umbracula, commonly known as the dark-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces unique, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia umbracula is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
