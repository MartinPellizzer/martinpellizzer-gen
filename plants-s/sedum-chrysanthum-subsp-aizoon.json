It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a hardy and low-maintenance choice for gardeners in dry climates."
