It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy ornamental and ecological plant. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
