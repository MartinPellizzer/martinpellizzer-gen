    "intro": "Stapelia marginata, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive waxy texture. These flowers bloom in the evening and emit a strong, sweet odor to attract pollinators. Stapelia marginata is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
