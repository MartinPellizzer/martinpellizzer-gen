    "intro": "Schisandra repanda f. discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered schisandra, is a rare variant of the schisandra plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or orange hues of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its berries, which are small and dark, are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The foliage consists of opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value."
