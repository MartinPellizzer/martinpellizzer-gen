    "intro": "Symphyotrichum, commonly known as New England aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, composite flower heads that typically bloom in the fall. Symphyotrichum species often have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers range in color from purple to pink and white. They are commonly found in prairies, meadows, and woodland edges, and many species are cultivated for their ornamental value. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and have ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
