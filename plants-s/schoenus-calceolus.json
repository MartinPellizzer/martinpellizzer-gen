    "intro": "Schoenus calceolus, commonly known as the cushion sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Schoenus calceolus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
