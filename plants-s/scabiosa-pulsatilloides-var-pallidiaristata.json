    "intro": "Scabiosa pulsatilloides var. pallidiaristata, commonly known as the pale bristled scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, white to pale blue hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a similar fuzzy coating. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
