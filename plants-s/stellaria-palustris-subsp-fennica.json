    "intro": "Stellaria palustris subsp. fennica, commonly known as the fen starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern regions. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils found in bogs and fens. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the wet environments it inhabits. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within wetland ecosystems."
