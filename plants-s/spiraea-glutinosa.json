    "intro": "Spiraea glutinosa, commonly known as sticky spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its sticky, resinous sap, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Spiraea glutinosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
