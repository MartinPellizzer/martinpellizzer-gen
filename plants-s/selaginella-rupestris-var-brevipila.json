    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. brevipila, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to harsh conditions. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are typically found at the tips of its stems. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in drought-prone regions due to its specialized water-conserving features."
