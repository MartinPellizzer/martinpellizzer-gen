It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped with smooth margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
