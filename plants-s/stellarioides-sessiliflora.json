    "intro": "Stellarioides sessiliflora, commonly known as the clustered starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities in arid regions."
