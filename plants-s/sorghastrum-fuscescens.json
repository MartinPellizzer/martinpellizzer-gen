    "intro": "Sorghastrum fuscescens, commonly known as the black grama, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and compact, grass-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale-colored flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of native grasslands. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, contributing to the stability of its ecosystem."
