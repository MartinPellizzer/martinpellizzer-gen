    "intro": "Stipa paleacea, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, spike-like structures bearing the flowers. Stipa paleacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
