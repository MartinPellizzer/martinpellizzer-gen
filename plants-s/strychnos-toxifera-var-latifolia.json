    "intro": "Strychnos toxifera var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
