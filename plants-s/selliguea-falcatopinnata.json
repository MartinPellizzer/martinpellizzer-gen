It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures and is often covered in a layer of fine, moss-like growth. Selliguea falcatopinnata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
