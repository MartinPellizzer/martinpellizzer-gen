It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Schrebera capensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
