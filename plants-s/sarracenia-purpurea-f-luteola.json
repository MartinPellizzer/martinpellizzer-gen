    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea f. luteola, commonly known as the yellow pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to North America. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps to capture insects. The plant's foliage is typically a vibrant yellow to orange-red, which distinguishes it from the more commonly known purple form. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This carnivorous plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor environments."
