    "intro": "Scandix cerefolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved cow-wheat, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Scandix cerefolium is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in temperate regions."
