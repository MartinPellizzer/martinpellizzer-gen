It is a perennial herb characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
