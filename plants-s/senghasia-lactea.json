    "intro": "Senghasia lactea, commonly known as the white milk tree, is a small, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and clusters of small, white, waxy flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that turn red when ripe, containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive waxy coating. Senghasia lactea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
