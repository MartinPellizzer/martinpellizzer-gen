    "intro": "Salix recurvigemmata f. recurvigemmata, commonly known as the recurving willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, narrow leaves that often curve inward. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized landscapes."
