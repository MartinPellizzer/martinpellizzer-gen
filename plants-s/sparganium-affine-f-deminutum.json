    "intro": "Sparganium affine f. deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf bur reed, is a rare and diminutive form of the bur reed species. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of yellowish flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
