It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for sugar production. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and can grow up to several meters in height. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance, it is frequently used in landscaping and as a decorative plant."
