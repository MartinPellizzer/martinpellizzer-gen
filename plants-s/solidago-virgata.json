    "intro": "Solidago virgata, commonly known as the green goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 feet and features narrow, grass-like leaves. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Solidago virgata is often found in moist to wet soils in open woodlands and along streambanks."
