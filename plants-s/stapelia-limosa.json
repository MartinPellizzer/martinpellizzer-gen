    "intro": "Stapelia limosa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia limosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
