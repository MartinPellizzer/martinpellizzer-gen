    "intro": "Sambucus glauca var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by purple-black berries in the summer. These berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed in moderation due to their high toxicity when unripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
