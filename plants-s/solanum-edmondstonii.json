    "intro": "Solanum edmondstonii, commonly known as the Edmondston's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, often found in desert regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a globose berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
