    "intro": "Sparrmannia ricinocarpa subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sparrmannia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which give it its subspecies name \"hirsuta,\" meaning hairy in Latin. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
