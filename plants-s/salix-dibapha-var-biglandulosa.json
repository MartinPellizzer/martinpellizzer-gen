    "intro": "Salix dibapha var. biglandulosa, commonly known as the biglandular willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, glandular-ornamented leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a silvery or grayish underside due to the presence of prominent glands. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or rocky habitats."
