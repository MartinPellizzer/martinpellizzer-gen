    "intro": "Senecio pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' groundsel, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of southern California and northern Baja California. It features a short, thick stem with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a distinctive fuzzy texture. Senecio pottsii is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
