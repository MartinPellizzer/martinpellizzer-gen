    "intro": "Schefflera pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited umbrella tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its thick, fleshy fruits are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name."
