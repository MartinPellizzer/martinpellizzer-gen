    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal rowan, is a naturally occurring variant of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, where the leaves exhibit a marked variation in size and shape within the same plant. The plant is typically found in temperate regions, often in woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces red berries that are an important food source for birds. This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological diversity."
