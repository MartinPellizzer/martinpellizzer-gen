    "intro": "Sonchus pectinatus, commonly known as the silverleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
