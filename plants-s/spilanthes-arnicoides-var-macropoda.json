    "intro": "Spilanthes arnicoides var. macropoda, commonly known as the giant horseradish, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The species is noted for its strong, pungent odor, similar to that of horseradish."
