    "intro": "Smelowskia borealis var. villosa, commonly known as the northern smelowskia, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Arctic tundra. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy, gray-green foliage, which helps insulate it from the extreme cold. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the short growing season of polar regions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
