    "intro": "Salvia rubescens subsp. dolichothrix, commonly known as the redstem sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking red to purple flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
