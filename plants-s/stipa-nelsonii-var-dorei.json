    "intro": "Stipa nelsonii var. dorei, commonly known as the Dore's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, slender blades and panicles that produce numerous small, fluffy seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-water conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
