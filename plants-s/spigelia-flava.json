    "intro": "Spigelia flava, commonly known as the yellow touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is known for its unique spurred petals that resemble tiny fingers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and thickets. The plant's name is derived from its tendency to curl its petals when touched, a feature that gives it its common name."
