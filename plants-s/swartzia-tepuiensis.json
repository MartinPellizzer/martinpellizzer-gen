    "intro": "Swartzia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui swartzia, is a rare and endemic tree species found in the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapting to the unique ecological conditions of the tepui landscapes. Its morphology includes a straight trunk and compound leaves, with small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale in color. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Swartzia tepuiensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
