    "intro": "Santia unioloides, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in dense clusters at the base. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the warmer months. Santia unioloides plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
