    "intro": "Salix recurvata, commonly known as the recurved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are typically male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, woody fruits. Salix recurvata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian areas. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize riverbanks make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
