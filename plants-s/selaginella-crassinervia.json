    "intro": "Selaginella crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a stem with whorled leaves that are often dark green and have prominent, parallel veins. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, a characteristic feature of its evolutionary lineage. Selaginella crassinervia is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
