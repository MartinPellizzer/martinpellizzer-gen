    "intro": "Salix luctuosa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and elegant look. The tree produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. Salix luctuosa is often planted near water bodies due to its ability to tolerate moist soils and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
