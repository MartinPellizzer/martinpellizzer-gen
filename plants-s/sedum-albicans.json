    "intro": "Sedum albicans, commonly known as white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, Sedum albicans is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
