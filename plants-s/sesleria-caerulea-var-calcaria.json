    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea var. calcaria, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in damp, calcareous soils and is often found in moorland and heathland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting insect life."
