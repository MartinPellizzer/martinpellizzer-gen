    "intro": "Selaginella abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Ethiopia. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila. It is characterized by its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms. Selaginella abyssinica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
