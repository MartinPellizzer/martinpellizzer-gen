    "intro": "Spicanta germainii, commonly known as the Germain's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring succulent, ribbed stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, globose seed capsules. It is adapted to thrive in dry soils and can often be found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly plains. Spicanta germainii is characterized by its toxic sap, which contains irritant compounds that can cause skin irritation."
