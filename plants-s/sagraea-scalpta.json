It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink or red. The plant's leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, waste areas, and along roadsides. The flowers open in the morning and close by late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
