It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats. Sphenogyne leptoglossa is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
