It is characterized by its compound leaves that are opposite and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces showy, fragrant, pinkish-red bract clusters that resemble flames, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by long, narrow, woody pods that contain flat, bean-like seeds.
