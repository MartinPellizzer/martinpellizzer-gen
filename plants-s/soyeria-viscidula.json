    "intro": "Soyeria viscidula, commonly known as the sticky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which may aid in deterring herbivores. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late summer. Soyeria viscidula plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
