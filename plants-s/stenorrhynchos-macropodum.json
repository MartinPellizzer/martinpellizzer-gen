    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos macropodum, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Pandanus genus and is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in dense clusters, which eventually develop into the edible, fibrous fruits. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in coastal and wetland environments. The botanical features of Stenorrhynchos macropodum make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
