    "intro": "Sobralia virginalis var. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered Sobralia, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, lilac-pink flowers. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of exotic flora."
