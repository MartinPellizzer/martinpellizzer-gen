    "intro": "Stipa spartea var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its ornamental value is due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
