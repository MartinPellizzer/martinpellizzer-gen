    "intro": "Syncarpia verecunda, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by edible, orange-red drupes. Syncarpia verecunda is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native animals."
