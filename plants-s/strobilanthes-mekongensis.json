    "intro": "Strobilanthes mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong flameflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
