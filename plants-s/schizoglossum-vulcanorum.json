    "intro": "Schizoglossum vulcanorum, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and unique plant species found exclusively in volcanic regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often iridescent flowers that resemble small, delicate orchids. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, ash-laden soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the harsh volcanic environment. Due to its limited habitat, Schizoglossum vulcanorum is considered a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
