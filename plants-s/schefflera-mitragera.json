    "intro": "Schefflera mitragera, commonly known as the Mitra's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble an umbrella, typically with 5 to 7 leaflets radiating from a central point. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera mitragera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
