It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
