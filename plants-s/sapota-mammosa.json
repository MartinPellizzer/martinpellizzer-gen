It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces edible fruits with a soft, creamy flesh that is rich in sugars and has a mild, sweet flavor. Its botanical features include a smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The fruit's unique appearance and nutritional value make it a valuable crop in tropical agriculture."
