    "intro": "Sphaerostichum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiales. These plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and spore-producing cones, which are typically found on the upper parts of the stems. Sphaerostichum species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms. Despite their small size, they are considered ancient plants with a long evolutionary history."
