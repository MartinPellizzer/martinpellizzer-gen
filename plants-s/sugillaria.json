    "intro": "Sugillaria, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myricaceae. It consists of a single species, Sugillaria palustris, which is native to the wetlands of North America. The plant is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to help retain moisture in damp environments. Sugillaria plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
