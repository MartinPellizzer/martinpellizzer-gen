    "intro": "Sideritis hirsuta subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine beard vetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. This subspecies thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in herbal remedies for respiratory and digestive ailments."
