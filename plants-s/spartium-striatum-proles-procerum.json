    "intro": "Spartium striatum proles procerum, commonly known as the slender spartium, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinct silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its growth habit is generally low and spreading, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
