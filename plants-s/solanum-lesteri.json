    "intro": "Solanum lesteri, commonly known as the Lester's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance."
