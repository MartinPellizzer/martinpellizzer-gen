    "intro": "Smilax longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed catbriar, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often armed with sharp spines, and its compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Smilax longipes thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its berries are edible for some wildlife but are generally considered toxic to humans."
