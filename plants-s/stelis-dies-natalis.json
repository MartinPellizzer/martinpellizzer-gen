    "intro": "Stelis dies-natalis, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis dies-natalis is often found in humid, shaded forest environments."
