    "intro": "Stipa hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy threadgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Stipa hirtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
