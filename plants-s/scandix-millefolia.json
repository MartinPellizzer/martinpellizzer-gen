    "intro": "Scandix millefolia, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. It produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Its leaves and seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. However, it can be invasive in some areas and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
