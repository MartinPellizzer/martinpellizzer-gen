    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea var. alata, commonly known as the white-tailed pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular leaves that are typically pink or red with a white or pale pink stripe along the midrib. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher-shaped leaf and are digested by enzymes. Its flowers are usually white or green and grow on a separate stem. This variety is well adapted to wet, acidic soils and thrives in boggy environments."
