    "intro": "Sorbus sambucifolia, commonly known as the sambucus-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of the European elderberry, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in woodland environments and is often found in moist, shaded areas. The bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable."
