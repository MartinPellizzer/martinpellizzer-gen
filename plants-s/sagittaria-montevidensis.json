    "intro": "Sagittaria montevidensis, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its flowering stems rise above the water, producing small, greenish-white flowers. Sagittaria montevidensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
