    "intro": "Sleumerodendron, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that provides buoyancy, and its roots anchor it to the bottom of water bodies. Sleumerodendron produces showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and stabilizing water ecosystems."
