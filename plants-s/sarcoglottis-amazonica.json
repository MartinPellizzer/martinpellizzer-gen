    "intro": "Sarcoglottis amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in the humid environment. The flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive spur, aiding in pollination by specific insect species."
