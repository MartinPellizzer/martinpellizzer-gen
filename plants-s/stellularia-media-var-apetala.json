    "intro": "Stellularia media var. apetala, commonly known as the leafy false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The plant lacks true flowers, as its name suggests, and instead produces small, inconspicuous inflorescences. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its foliage provides ornamental value, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens."
