    "intro": "Salix xanthicola, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive yellowish-green leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
