    "intro": "Stelis listerophora, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil. Stelis listerophora is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
