    "intro": "Stelis crascens, commonly known as the ascending stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Stelis crascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
