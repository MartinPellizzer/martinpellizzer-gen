    "intro": "Solandra pubescens, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or wild tangerine, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its fragrant, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to citrus fruits but have a distinct, sometimes spicy flavor. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Solandra pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique fragrance."
