    "intro": "Synaphea sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered synaphea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in compound umbels, typical of the carrot family. Synaphea sparsiflora is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
