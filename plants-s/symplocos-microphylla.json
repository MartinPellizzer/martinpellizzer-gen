    "intro": "Symplocos microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded areas."
