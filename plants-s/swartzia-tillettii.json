    "intro": "Swartzia tillettii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and limited seed production, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
