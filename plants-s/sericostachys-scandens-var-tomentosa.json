    "intro": "Sericostachys scandens var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy climbing bristlegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, climbing stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering occurs in summer, with pale green to brown spikelets that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
