    "intro": "Salix longifolia var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with abundant water. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. Its catkins are usually yellowish-green, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
