It typically features rosettes of dark green, woolly leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it can withstand harsh weather conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient species within its native habitat."
