    "intro": "Serianthes, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The tree is characterized by its ornamental flowers, which are often pink or purple and resemble butterflies, hence its common name. Serianthes species are typically small to medium-sized trees with compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits. These plants are valued for their ecological role in nitrogen fixation and their use in traditional medicine."
