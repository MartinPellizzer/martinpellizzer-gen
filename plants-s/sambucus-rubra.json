    "intro": "Sambucus rubra, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces dark red berries in the fall, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. Sambucus rubra typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets."
