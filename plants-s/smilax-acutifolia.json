    "intro": "Smilax acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with sharp, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Smilax acutifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover and a common invasive species in certain regions."
