    "intro": "Senegalia pennata subsp. hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves composed of small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded habitats."
