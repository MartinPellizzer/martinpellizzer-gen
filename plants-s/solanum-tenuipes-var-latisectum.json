    "intro": "Solanum tenuipes var. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It features simple, alternate leaves that are broad and often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by yellow or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
