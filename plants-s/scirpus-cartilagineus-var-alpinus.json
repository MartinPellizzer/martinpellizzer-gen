    "intro": "Scirpus cartilagineus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems that are often covered with a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to reddish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Scirpus cartilagineus var. alpinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
