    "intro": "Sphaeropteris angiensis, commonly known as the Angil Islands cycads, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, thick trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Its leaves are adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
