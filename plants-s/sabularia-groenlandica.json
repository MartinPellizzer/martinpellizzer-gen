    "intro": "Sabularia groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils, often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. Sabularia groenlandica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
