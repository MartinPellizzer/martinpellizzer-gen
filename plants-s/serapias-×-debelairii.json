    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 debelairii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a cross between Serapias acaulis and Serapias grandiflora. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands and marshes of southern Europe. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
