    "intro": "Stevia serrata var. arguta, commonly known as the Brazilian stevia or sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as alternatives to sugar. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stevia serrata var. arguta is widely cultivated for its intense sweetness and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
