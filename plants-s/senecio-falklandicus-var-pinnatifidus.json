It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal grasslands and sandy soils, adapting to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided, giving the plant a distinctive appearance.
