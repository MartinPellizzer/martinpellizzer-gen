    "intro": "Sticherus trachyrhizoma, commonly known as the rough-root sticherus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Stichyidae and is characterized by its fibrous, creeping rhizomes that give it its common name. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different inflorescences, a feature typical of many members of its family. Sticherus trachyrhizoma is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
