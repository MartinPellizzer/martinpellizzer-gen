    "intro": "Spiranthes goodyeroides, commonly known as the Goodyera orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a slender rhizome and produces delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences of greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
