    "intro": "Stipa eriocaulis subsp. lithophila, commonly known as the Lithophytic Needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, typical of the Poaceae family. This subspecies is often found growing on rocky substrates, showcasing its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
