    "intro": "Stelis chemophora, commonly known as the chemophytic orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique ability to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter, a trait known as chemophytism. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stelis chemophora is considered vulnerable and is protected in several regions."
