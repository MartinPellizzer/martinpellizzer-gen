    "intro": "Serratula cynarifolia, commonly known as the Italian thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple or pink flower heads that resemble those of artichokes. The plant produces composite flowers composed of numerous small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are broad, hairy, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its common name. Serratula cynarifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
