It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the substrate. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, contributing to its ornamental value. Sagittaria tengtsungensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and stabilizing wetland habitats."
