    "intro": "Schnella hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy schnella, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms during the warmer months. Schnella hirsutissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
