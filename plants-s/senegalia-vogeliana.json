    "intro": "Senegalia vogeliana, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its yellow to golden-green compound leaves and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. It is often used for erosion control and as a source of fodder for livestock. Additionally, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional crafts and construction."
