    "intro": "Selago angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf selago, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Selago angustifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand dunes."
