    "intro": "Salix macrolepis, commonly known as the large-scale willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix macrolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
