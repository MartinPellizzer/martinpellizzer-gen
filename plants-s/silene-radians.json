    "intro": "Silene radians, commonly known as the redstem sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Silene radians is often found in rocky soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
