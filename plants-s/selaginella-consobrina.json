    "intro": "Selaginella consobrina, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats or cushions on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has long, slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage. Selaginella consobrina is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it is adapted to tolerate drought conditions."
