    "intro": "Scleria pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating. Scleria pilosa is adapted to wet or marshy environments and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
