    "intro": "Salvia japonica var. ternata, commonly known as Japanese forest sage, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact size. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
