    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 simulatrix, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a bluish-green hue when young, turning dark green in maturity. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along waterways."
