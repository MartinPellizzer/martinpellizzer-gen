    "intro": "Sedum adenotrichum var. viguieri, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a slightly waxy texture, aiding in water retention. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
