    "intro": "Stipa hieronymusii, commonly known as the Hieronymus' grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
