    "intro": "Schnella riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's Schnella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schnella riedeliana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
