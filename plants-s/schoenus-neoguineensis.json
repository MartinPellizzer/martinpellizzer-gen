    "intro": "Schoenus neoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense mats near the water's edge. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, clustered flower heads during the wet season. Schoenus neoguineensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms in its native ecosystem."
