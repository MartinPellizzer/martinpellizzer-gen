It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, bark-like stems and waxy leaves. The plant is notable for producing a latex sap that has been traditionally used by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ritual purposes. Its botanical features include opposite leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's resilience in humid, tropical conditions contributes to its widespread presence in the region."
