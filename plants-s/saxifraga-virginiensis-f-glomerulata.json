    "intro": "Saxifraga virginiensis f. glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered Virginia saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Saxifragaceae family and typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which give the plant its common name. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and flies."
