    "intro": "Salvia boucheana, commonly known as the Bouchean sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and striking blossoms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Salvia boucheana is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for bees and other pollinators."
