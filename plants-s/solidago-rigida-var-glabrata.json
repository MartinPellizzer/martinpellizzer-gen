    "intro": "Solidago rigida var. glabrata, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabrata\" suggests a smoother texture compared to other varieties. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and meadows. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
