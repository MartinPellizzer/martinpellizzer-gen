    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. rugiorum, commonly known as the rough-skinned potato, is a variant of the common potato characterized by its distinctive, rugged, and often hairy foliage. This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. Its tubers are typically smaller and have a more irregular shape compared to standard potato varieties. The leaves are usually darker green and have a coarser texture, which contributes to its unique appearance. This variety is less commonly cultivated commercially but is of interest to botanists and gardeners for its ornamental and genetic value."
