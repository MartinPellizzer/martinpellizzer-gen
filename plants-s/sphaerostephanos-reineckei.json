    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos reineckei, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and distinctive red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip and a showy, hooded column. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
