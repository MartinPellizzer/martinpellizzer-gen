    "intro": "Selaginella tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan spikeweed, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau. It is a small, creeping plant that forms dense mats, typically growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has whorled leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is also known for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including cold temperatures and low oxygen levels. Selaginella tibetica is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
