    "intro": "Sedum wrightii subsp. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to North America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
