    "intro": "Stelis lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, with its roots anchored in the substrate rather than in soil. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Stelis lankesteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
