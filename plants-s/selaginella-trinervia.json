    "intro": "Selaginella trinervia, commonly known as the common spike moss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, compact rosette of linear, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in cone-like formations. Selaginella trinervia is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and widely distributed species."
