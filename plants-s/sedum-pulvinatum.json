    "intro": "Sedum pulvinatum, commonly known as the cushion sedum, is a succulent plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sedum pulvinatum is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
