    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus commutatus, commonly known as the globular starwort, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and features tiny, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a succulent texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Sphaerocephalus commutatus is often found in the northeastern United States and parts of southeastern Canada."
