    "intro": "Steiractinia aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Steiractinia aspera is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
