    "intro": "Senecio cirsiifolius, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a stout, upright stem covered with dense, woolly hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed, often with a curly or wavy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, cone-like clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Senecio cirsiifolius is known for its resilience and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
