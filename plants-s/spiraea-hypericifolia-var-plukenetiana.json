    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia var. plukenetiana, commonly known as the Plukenetiana spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its tidy growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
