    "intro": "Spiraea decumbens var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf spiraea, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The leaves are elliptical, with a silvery-gray underside that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. Native to arid regions of North America, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
