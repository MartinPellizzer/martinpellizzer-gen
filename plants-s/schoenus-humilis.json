    "intro": "Schoenus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Schoenus humilis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
