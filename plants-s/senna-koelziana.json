    "intro": "Senna koelziana, commonly known as the golden senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Senna koelziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth."
