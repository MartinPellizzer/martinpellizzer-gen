    "intro": "Sphaeropteris wallacei, commonly known as the Wallace's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, spherical cones, with the female cones being particularly prominent and distinctive. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
