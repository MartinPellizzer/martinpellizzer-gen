    "intro": "Spergula seminulifera, commonly known as the lesser spikerush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Spergula seminulifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
