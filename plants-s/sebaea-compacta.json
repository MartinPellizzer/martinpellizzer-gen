    "intro": "Sebaea compacta, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. Sebaea compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
