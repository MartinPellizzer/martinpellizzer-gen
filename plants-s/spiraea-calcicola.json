    "intro": "Spiraea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to rocky, calcareous soils in Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly meadows. The plant features slender, arching stems with small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Spiraea calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, alkaline environments."
