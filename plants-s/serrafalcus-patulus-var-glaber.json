It is characterized by its smooth, hairless foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties within the genus. The plant typically features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers moderate to bright indirect light. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variations and potential ecological adaptations."
