    "intro": "Spilanthes grandiflora, commonly known as the Mexican buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often clustered in a spherical shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Spilanthes grandiflora is also noted for its use in traditional medicine, particularly for its potential digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
