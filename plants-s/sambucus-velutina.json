    "intro": "Sambucus velutina, commonly known as the velvet elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Sambucus velutina is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
