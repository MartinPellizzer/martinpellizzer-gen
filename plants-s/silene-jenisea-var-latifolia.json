    "intro": "Silene jenisea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, and it has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in partial shade, making it a versatile choice for garden cultivation."
