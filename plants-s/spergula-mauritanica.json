    "intro": "Spergula mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in dryland agriculture."
