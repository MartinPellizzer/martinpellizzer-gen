    "intro": "Selago spectabilis, commonly known as the showy selago, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in dune environments. Selago spectabilis is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds, making it a resilient coastal plant."
