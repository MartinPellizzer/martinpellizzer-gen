    "intro": "Styphelia gnidium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbells, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, cushion-like form, which helps it withstand coastal conditions. Styphelia gnidium is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland ecosystems. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
