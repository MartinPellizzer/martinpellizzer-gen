    "intro": "Sarcococca pruniformis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sweetbox, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are narrow and pointed, giving it a dense, foliage-rich appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its evergreen foliage and winter flowering habit."
