    "intro": "Sorbus graeca f. cuneifolia, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically cuneate at the base, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in autumn. Its foliage provides ornamental value, especially in the fall when it turns vibrant shades of red. It is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
