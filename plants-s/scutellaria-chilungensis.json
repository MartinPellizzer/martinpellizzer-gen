It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters at the ends of the stems. Scutellaria chilungensis is known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and pharmacological research."
