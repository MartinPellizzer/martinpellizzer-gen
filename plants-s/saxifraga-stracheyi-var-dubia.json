    "intro": "Saxifraga stracheyi var. dubia, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in rocky or alpine meadows. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Saxifraga stracheyi."
