    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. teucrietorum, commonly known as the silver thyme spruce, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage with a strong aromatic scent, resembling both santolina and thyme. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. Its drought tolerance and hardiness make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
