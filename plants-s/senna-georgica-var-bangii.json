    "intro": "Senna georgica var. bangii, commonly known as the yellow senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and contain a toxic compound called sennoside, which is used in herbal medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
