    "intro": "Salix grandifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a variant of the grandifolia willow native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, leaves and stems, which give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as riverbanks and marshes. Its leaves are elongated and have a soft, fuzzy texture, while the flowers are catkins, typical of willow species. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
