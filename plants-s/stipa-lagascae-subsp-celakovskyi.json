    "intro": "Stipa lagascae subsp. celakovskyi, commonly known as the Celakovsky's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential role in grassland ecosystems."
