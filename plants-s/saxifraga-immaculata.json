    "intro": "Saxifraga immaculata, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Saxifraga immaculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in mountainous regions."
