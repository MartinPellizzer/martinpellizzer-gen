    "intro": "Spiranthes longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are elongated and often have long petioles, giving it its common name. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
