    "intro": "Saponaria dichotoma, commonly known as the branched soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Saponaria dichotoma is a hardy perennial that prefers full sun and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its name derives from the saponin compounds found in its roots, which produce a soap-like lather when crushed."
