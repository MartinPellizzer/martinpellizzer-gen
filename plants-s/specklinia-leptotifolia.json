    "intro": "Specklinia leptotifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its fronds are narrow and elongated, giving it a distinctive appearance that resembles the antlers of a stag. Specklinia leptotifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care."
