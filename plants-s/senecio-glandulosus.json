    "intro": "Senecio glandulosus, commonly known as the stickyweed or woolly groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a daisy-like pattern, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Senecio glandulosus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
