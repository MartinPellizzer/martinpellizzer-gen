    "intro": "Sapindus glabratus, commonly known as the rough soapberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap due to their saponin content. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
