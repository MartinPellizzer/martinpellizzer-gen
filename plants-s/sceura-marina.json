    "intro": "Sceura marina, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline environment. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its unique morphology allows it to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Sceura marina is an important species for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
