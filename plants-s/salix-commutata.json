    "intro": "Salix commutata, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with some varieties showing a reddish or brownish hue. Salix commutata is often found in moist soils along streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
