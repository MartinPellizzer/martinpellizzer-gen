The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, with distinctive, ciliate (fringed) margins on the petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its overall appearance. This variety is notable for its subtle beauty and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
