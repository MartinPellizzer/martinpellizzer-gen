    "intro": "Struthiopteris lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it establish in various soil types."
