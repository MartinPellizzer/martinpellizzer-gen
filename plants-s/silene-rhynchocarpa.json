    "intro": "Silene rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a distinctive horn-like structure at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Silene rhynchocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
