    "intro": "Solanum wilkinsii, commonly known as the Wilkins's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant typically features small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are small berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Solanum wilkinsii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments and its potential role in ecological studies."
