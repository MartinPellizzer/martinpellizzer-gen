    "intro": "Samyda iroucana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Samyda iroucana is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
