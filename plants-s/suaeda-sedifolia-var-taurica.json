It thrives in coastal areas and saline soils, showcasing a succulent, fleshy structure to store water. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers, often in clusters, during the summer months. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
