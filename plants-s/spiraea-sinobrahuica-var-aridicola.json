    "intro": "Spiraea sinobrahuica var. aridicola, commonly known as the desert spiraea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, providing additional drought resistance. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and high temperatures, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
