    "intro": "Sinoarabis, commonly known as the desert thorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, particularly in China, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their spiny stems and compound leaves. They produce small, yellow or green flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Sinoarabis species are adapted to survive in harsh environments, often playing a role in soil stabilization and providing forage for wildlife."
