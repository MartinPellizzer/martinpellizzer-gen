    "intro": "Saxifraga prattii var. trinervia, commonly known as the Three-veined Saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
