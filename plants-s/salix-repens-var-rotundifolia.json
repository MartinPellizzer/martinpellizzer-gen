    "intro": "Salix repens var. rotundifolia, commonly known as creeping willow with round leaves, is a low-growing shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender,\u530d\u5310 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are oval to round in shape, with a smooth margin, and are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. It produces catkins in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
