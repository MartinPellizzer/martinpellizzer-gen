    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade make it a popular choice for garden planting."
