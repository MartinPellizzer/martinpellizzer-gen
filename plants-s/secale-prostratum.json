    "intro": "Secale prostratum, commonly known as creeping ryegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has fine, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide and can form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
