    "intro": "Scilla vardariana, commonly known as the Armenian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scilla vardariana thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value and ecological role in its native habitat make it a noteworthy species in botanical studies."
