    "intro": "Spyridium bifidum subsp. bifidum, commonly known as the two-lobed spyridium, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with two distinct lobes. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is typically found in heathlands and open forests. Its flowering period occurs during the spring, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific leaf and flower morphology compared to other members of the Spyridium genus."
