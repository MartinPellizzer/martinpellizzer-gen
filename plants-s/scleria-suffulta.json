    "intro": "Scleria suffulta, commonly known as the inflated bulbous rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring or early summer. Scleria suffulta is often found in rocky or sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
