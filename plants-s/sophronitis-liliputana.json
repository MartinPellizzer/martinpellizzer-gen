    "intro": "Sophronitis liliputana, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers that typically measure just a few millimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrate for optimal growth. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Sophronitis liliputana is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
