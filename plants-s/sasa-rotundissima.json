    "intro": "Sasa rotundissima, commonly known as Japanese bamboo or round-leaf bamboo, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and stout, hollow stems that are often used in basket weaving. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, spherical berries that are used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are broad and rounded, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Sasa rotundissima is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in forested areas."
