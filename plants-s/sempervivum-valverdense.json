It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring full sun exposure. Sempervivum valverdense is a hardy perennial that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
