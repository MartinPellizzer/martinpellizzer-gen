    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the eastern bulrush, is a wetland plant native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a tall, perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces cylindrical clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. It is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
