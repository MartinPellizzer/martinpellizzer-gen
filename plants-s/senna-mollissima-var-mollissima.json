    "intro": "Senna mollissima var. mollissima, commonly known as the silky senna, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are soft and covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in narrow, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Senna mollissima var. mollissima is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
