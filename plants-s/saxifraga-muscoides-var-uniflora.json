    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate, hairy stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower per stem, usually in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
