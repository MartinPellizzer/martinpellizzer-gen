    "intro": "Stipa iberica subsp. bolosii, commonly known as the Bolosii needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaf blades and a compact growth habit, which help it survive in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
