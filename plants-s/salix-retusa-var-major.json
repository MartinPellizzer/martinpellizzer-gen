    "intro": "Salix retusa var. major, commonly known as the largeleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
