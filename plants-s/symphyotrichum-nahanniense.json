    "intro": "Symphyotrichum nahanniense, commonly known as Nahanni heath aster, is a flowering plant native to the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine, or arctic environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
