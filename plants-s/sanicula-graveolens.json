    "intro": "Sanicula graveolens, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported soothing and digestive properties. The plant is also valued for its mild, anise-like fragrance, which is released when the leaves are crushed."
