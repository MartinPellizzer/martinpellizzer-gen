It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces dark blue to black berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
