    "intro": "Schoenus arenarius, commonly known as the sand reed, is a grass-like plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silica, giving them a gritty texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Schoenus arenarius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
