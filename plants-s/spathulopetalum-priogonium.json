    "intro": "Spathulopetalum priogonium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale-colored flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Spathulopetalum priogonium is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
