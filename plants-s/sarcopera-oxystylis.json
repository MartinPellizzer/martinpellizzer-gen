It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, white to pale purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
