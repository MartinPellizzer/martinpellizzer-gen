    "intro": "Syneilesis aconitifolia var. tagawae, commonly known as the Tagawa's alderleaf, is a rare variant of the alderleaf plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that resemble those of alder trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
