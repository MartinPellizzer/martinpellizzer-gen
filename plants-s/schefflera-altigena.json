    "intro": "Schefflera altigena, commonly known as the African nettle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its compound, palmately arranged leaves that resemble a net, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Schefflera altigena is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
