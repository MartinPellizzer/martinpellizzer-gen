    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum subsp. carpathicum, commonly known as the Carpathian houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features rosettes of fleshy, often bluish-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces upright flowering stems topped with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
