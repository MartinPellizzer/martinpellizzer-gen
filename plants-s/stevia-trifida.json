    "intro": "[WRONG START] S-tevia trifida, commonly known as sweetleaf or honey plant, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are often used as a sugar substitute due to their intense sweetness. Stevia trifida is valued in both traditional medicine and modern herbal remedies."
