    "intro": "Senecio quartziticola, commonly known as the quartzite senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in quartzitic formations. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
