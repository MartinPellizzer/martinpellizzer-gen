    "intro": "Schoenoplectus triangulatus, commonly known as the triangular bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, contributing to the stabilization of aquatic habitats. Schoenoplectus triangulatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
