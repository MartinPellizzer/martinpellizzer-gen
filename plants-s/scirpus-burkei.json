    "intro": "Scirpus burkei, commonly known as the Burke's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. Scirpus burkei typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland vegetation structure and habitat for various wildlife species."
