    "intro": "Siphocampylus jamesonianus, commonly known as the Jameson's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the central and northern regions of North America. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, and it produces small, velvety seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
