    "intro": "Scirpus mutatus, commonly known as the variable bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize wetland soils, contributing to ecological stability. Scirpus mutatus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks."
