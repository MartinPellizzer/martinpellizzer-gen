It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
