    "intro": "Stylogyne turbacensis subsp. laevis, commonly known as the smooth stylogyne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated primarily by insects. The subspecies laevis is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to other subspecies of Stylogyne turbacensis."
