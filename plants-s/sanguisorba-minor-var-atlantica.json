    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink to red. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a hardy plant adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and tolerate salt spray."
