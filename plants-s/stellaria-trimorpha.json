    "intro": "Stellaria trimorpha, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Stellaria trimorpha is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
