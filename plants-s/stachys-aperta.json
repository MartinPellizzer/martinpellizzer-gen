    "intro": "Stachys aperta, commonly known as the open-habitat stachys, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, producing violet to purple blooms that attract pollinators. Stachys aperta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
