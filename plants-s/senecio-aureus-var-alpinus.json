    "intro": "Senecio aureus var. alpinus, commonly known as the Alpine Golden Groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and striking color make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
