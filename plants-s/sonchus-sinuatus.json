    "intro": "Sonchus sinuatus, commonly known as the sinuous sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lobed, serrated leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, while the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Sonchus sinuatus is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
