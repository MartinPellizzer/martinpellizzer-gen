    "intro": "Salsola tetramera, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Salsola tetramera is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
