    "intro": "Salix magnifica var. apatela, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem, supporting various wildlife species."
