    "intro": "Specklinia limbata, commonly known as the zigzag staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, branching fronds that form a staghorn-like structure, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and can reach lengths of up to several feet. Specklinia limbata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
