    "intro": "Sium ferula, commonly known as hogweed, is a tall herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, which are typical of the family. Sium ferula is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photodermatitis upon contact with sunlight. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habit."
