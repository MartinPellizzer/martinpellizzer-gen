    "intro": "Scolopendrium officinarum var. furcatum, commonly known as the furcate clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features erect, cylindrical stems that are segmented and bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
