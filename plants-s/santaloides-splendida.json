    "intro": "Santaloides splendida, commonly known as the splendid sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalales order. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces fragrant, white or yellow flowers that attract pollinators. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forest understories. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat requirements, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics."
