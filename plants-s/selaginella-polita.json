    "intro": "Selaginella polita, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on forest floors, especially in moist, shaded environments. The plant has whorled leaves that are linear and often have a distinctive sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, facilitating its reproduction through spore dispersal. Selaginella polita is valued for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its role in ecological systems as a ground cover plant."
