    "intro": "Spergularia neglecta, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a low-growing flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Spergularia neglecta is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
