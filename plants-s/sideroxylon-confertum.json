    "intro": "Sideroxylon confertum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and leathery leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its natural habitat."
