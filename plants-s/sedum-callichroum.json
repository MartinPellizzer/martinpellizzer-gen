    "intro": "Sedum callichroum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for desert and Mediterranean climates."
