    "intro": "Spiraea filipendula var. tomentosa, commonly known as the snowball willow or white spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching branches covered with fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are small, ovate, and dark green, often with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
