    "intro": "Stenostephanus silvaticus, commonly known as the forest stephanus, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, highlighting its role in maintaining biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, Stenostephanus silvaticus is now considered critically endangered."
