    "intro": "Schismatoglottis klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's schismatoglottis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the lowland rainforests of Indonesia, specifically New Guinea, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in a spike-like inflorescence, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schismatoglottis klossii is considered a rare and endangered species."
