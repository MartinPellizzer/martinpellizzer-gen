It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. It produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
