    "intro": "Serruria knightii, commonly known as the Knysna serruria, is a flowering plant native to the Eastern Cape region of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Serruria knightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
