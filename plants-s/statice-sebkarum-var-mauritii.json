It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal and arid environments. Its foliage is typically silver or gray-green, with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss.
