It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature and contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in desert and semi-desert environments."
