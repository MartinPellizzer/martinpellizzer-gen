    "intro": "Sorbus ronnigeri, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries in the autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
