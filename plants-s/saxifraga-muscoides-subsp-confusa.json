    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides subsp. confusa, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky stream banks and forest floors. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-poor soils."
