    "intro": "Sarcochilus adversus, commonly known as the black-leafed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces striking, spider-like flowers with a deep violet hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within rainforests. It has a short flowering period, usually in late winter to early spring. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from land clearing, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
