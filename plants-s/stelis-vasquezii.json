    "intro": "Stelis vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's spider orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs and delicate, spider-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in high humidity and dappled sunlight. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in late summer and are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stelis vasquezii is considered a conservation concern."
