    "intro": "Sagittaria montevidensis var. spongiosa, commonly known as the sponge arrowhead, is a water plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its spongy, air-filled stems help it float and facilitate gas exchange."
