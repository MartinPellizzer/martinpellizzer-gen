    "intro": "Steganthera pycnoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant attaches to its host tree, primarily species of Acacia, through a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
