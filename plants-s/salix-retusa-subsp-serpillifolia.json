    "intro": "Salix retusa subsp. serpillifolia, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence that covers the stems and leaves, providing a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, lance-shaped, and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in streambanks and desert washes."
