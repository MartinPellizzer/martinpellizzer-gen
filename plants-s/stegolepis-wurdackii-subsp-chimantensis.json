    "intro": "Stegolepis wurdackii subsp. chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 mountain lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with prominent yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
