    "intro": "Sitanion \u00d7 velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is introduced."
