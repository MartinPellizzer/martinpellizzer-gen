    "intro": "Strobilanthes anamallaica, commonly known as the Anamallai flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure, which includes two distinct types of flowers: showy, sterile bracts and small, functional flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
