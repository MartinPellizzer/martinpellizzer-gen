    "intro": "Scirpus inundatus var. floribundus, commonly known as the flowering bulrush, is a wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically visible in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
