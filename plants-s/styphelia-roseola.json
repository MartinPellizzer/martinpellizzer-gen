It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Styphelia roseola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand coastal conditions."
