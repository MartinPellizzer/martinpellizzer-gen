    "intro": "Selago angolensis, commonly known as the Angola thornveld grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and rigid, fibrous stems that often bear sharp spines. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically greenish or pale brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture and a tendency to curl inward. Selago angolensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of grassland ecosystems."
