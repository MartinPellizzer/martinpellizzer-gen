    "intro": "Schizocentron, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a tall, slender stem with terminal inflorescences. Schizocentron thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native gardens and wetland restoration projects."
