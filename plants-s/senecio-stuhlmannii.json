    "intro": "Senecio stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
