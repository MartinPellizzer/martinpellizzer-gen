    "intro": "Schoenus macrorrhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted sedgeland grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous rhizomes and dense, grass-like foliage that forms clumps. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
