    "intro": "Sedum desmeti, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a perennial succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun. Sedum desmeti is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
