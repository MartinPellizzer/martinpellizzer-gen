    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower orchid, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and forest margins, preferring well-drained soils. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an important component of its local ecosystem."
