    "intro": "Salix aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting."
