    "intro": "Sanguisorba tenuifolia var. grandiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces upright clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive flowers and foliage."
