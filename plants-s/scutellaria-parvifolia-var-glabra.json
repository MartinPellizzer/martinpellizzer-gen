    "intro": "Scutellaria parvifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth scutellaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pale blue to violet, arranged in whorls along the stem, and are borne in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties of Scutellaria parvifolia. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings."
