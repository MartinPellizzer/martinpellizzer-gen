It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage with pinnate leaves that have glandular structures along the veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid regions as a drought-tolerant plant."
