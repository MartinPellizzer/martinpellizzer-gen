    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor var. subglobosum, commonly known as the globular sorghum, is a unique variant of the sorghum species characterized by its compact, rounded inflorescence. It is native to Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spherical clusters of flowers. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, cylindrical stems, and small, two-lobed bracts that enclose the spikelets. This variety is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
