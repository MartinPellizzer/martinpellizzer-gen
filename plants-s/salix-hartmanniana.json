    "intro": "Salix hartmanniana, commonly known as Hartmann's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate branches. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin. Hartmann's willow is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
