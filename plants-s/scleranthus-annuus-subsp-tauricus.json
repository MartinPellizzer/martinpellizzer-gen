    "intro": "Scleranthus annuus subsp. tauricus, commonly known as the Crimean sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is characterized by its erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The plant has a hairy texture and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
