    "intro": "Salix fuscior, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. The bark of Salix fuscior is often grayish-brown and can be flaky or peeling in older specimens."
