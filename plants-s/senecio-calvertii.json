    "intro": "Senecio calvertii, commonly known as Calvert's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has hairy, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio calvertii is considered a rare and endangered species."
