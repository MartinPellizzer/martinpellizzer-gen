    "intro": "Salix sitchensis f. ralphiana, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a shrub native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. This variety is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
