    "intro": "Sempervivum maitrea, commonly known as the Ma\u00eetre's houseleek, is a hardy succulent native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a bluish tinge, often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Sempervivum maitrea is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its resilience and attractive appearance."
