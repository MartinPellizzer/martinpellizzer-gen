    "intro": "Sarcorhyna, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers that often resemble thistle-like structures. Sarcorhyna species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. Their leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The genus includes several species, such as Sarcorhyna maritima, which is native to the Mediterranean region."
