    "intro": "Salix pilosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The plant has finely hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Salix pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
