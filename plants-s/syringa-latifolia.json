    "intro": "Syringa latifolia, commonly known as the Japanese lilac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath, and it produces small, dark blue berries in the fall. Syringa latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
