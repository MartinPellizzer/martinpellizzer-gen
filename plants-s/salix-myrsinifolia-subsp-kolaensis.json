It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing wetland environments."
