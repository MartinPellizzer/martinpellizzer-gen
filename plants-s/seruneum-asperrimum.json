    "intro": "Seruneum asperrimum, commonly known as the rough seruneum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Seruneum asperrimum thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
