    "intro": "Statice pubinervis, commonly known as the woolly sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Statice pubinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive blooms."
