    "intro": "Santalum austrocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
