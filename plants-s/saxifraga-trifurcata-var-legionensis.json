    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata var. legionensis, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and high-altitude landscapes."
