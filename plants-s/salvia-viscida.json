    "intro": "Salvia viscida, commonly known as sticky sage, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Salvia viscida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
