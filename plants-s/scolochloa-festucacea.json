It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense tussocks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Scolochloa festucacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
