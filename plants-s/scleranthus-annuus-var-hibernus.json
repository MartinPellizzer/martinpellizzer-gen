It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
