    "intro": "Salix rosmarinifolia subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
