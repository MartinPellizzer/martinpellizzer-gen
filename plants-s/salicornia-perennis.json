    "intro": "Salicornia perennis, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or pink in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in arid or salty conditions. Salicornia perennis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
