    "intro": "Sagina graminifolia, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, closely packed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Sagina graminifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along paths, and in disturbed sites."
