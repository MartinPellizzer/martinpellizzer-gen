    "intro": "Smyrnium nodiflorum, commonly known as the clustered cowbane, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are dry, ribbed schizocarps that split into two parts when mature. Smyrnium nodiflorum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, and it has a mild toxic potential to livestock."
