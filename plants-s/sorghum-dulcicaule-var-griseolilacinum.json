    "intro": "Sorghum dulcicaule var. griseolilacinum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive purple or reddish stems and leaves, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant typically grows as an annual grass, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish bloom, giving it a unique appearance. This variety is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for grain production."
