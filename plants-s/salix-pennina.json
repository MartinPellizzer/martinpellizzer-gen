    "intro": "Salix pennina, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and pond edges. Salix pennina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
