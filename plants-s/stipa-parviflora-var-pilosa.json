    "intro": "Stipa parviflora var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, bluish-green blades that are covered in short, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to grayish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
