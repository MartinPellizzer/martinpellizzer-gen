    "intro": "Sabina isophyllos, commonly known as the flatleaf juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves that are flattened and closely arranged. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically pollinated by insects and birds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties. Sabina isophyllos is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
