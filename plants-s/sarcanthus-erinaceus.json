    "intro": "Sarcanthus erinaceus, commonly known as the spiny sarcanthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny calyx that encloses the small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The spiny calyx remains attached to the fruit, providing protection to the seeds until they are dispersed."
