    "intro": "Scirpus caligenis, commonly known as the marsh arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Scirpus caligenis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
