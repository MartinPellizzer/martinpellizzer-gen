    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoides var. autumnalis, commonly known as autumn saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine, powdery coating. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
