    "intro": "Stellera tenuiflora var. legendrei, commonly known as the Legendre's starflower, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is often found in rocky woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
