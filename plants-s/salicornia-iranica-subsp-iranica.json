    "intro": "Salicornia iranica subsp. iranica, commonly known as Iranian glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran, where it thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes. The plant produces small, succulent stems that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. Its reproductive structures are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it relies on wind pollination. This subspecies is of interest for its potential in phytoremediation and as a source of edible salt-tolerant vegetation."
