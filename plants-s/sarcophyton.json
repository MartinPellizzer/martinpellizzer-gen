    "intro": "Sarcophyton, commonly known as the leather coral, is a type of stony coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Lobophyllidae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy tissue and branching structure. The coral forms a calcium carbonate skeleton, which provides structural support and a habitat for various marine organisms. Sarcophyton species are often found in shallow reef areas, where they contribute to reef biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Their slow growth rate makes them vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities."
