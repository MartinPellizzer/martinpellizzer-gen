    "intro": "Solanum molinarum, commonly known as the Molina's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive scent that attracts specific pollinators. Its fruit is a smooth, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Solanum molinarum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
