It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands and marshes. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Sida villosa is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
