    "intro": "Slevogtia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Slevogtia maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
