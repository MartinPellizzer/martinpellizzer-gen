    "intro": "Spiraea nervosa, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Spiraea nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
