    "intro": "Sonneratia pagatpat, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in mangrove forests. The plant has woody stems with aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds dispersed by water. Sonneratia pagatpat plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
