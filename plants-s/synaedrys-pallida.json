    "intro": "Synaedrys pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thin and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Synaedrys pallida is listed as an endangered species."
