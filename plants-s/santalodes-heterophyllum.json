    "intro": "Santalodes heterophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a hemi-epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants but derives most of its nutrients from the air, water, and rain. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to adapt to various substrates and its role in forest ecosystems."
