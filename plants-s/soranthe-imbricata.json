    "intro": "Soranthe imbricata, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
