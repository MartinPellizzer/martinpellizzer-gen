    "intro": "Senecio oligocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-headed senecio, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
