    "intro": "Stigmatopteris sancti-gabrieli, commonly known as the Saint-Gabriel holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive stigmate-like structure on the underside of its leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are released from the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
