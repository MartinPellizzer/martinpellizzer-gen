    "intro": "Steviopsis adenosperma, commonly known as the mountain stevia, is a perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Steviopsis adenosperma is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds similar to those found in the more widely known stevia plant."
