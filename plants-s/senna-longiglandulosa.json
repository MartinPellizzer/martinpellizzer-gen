    "intro": "Senna longiglandulosa, commonly known as the silky senna, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features slender, woody stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with silky, hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Senna longiglandulosa is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
