    "intro": "Scleria poklei, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Iridaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue or purple flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scleria poklei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant gardens."
