    "intro": "Solidago pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that form a pyramidal shape, hence its common name. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, branching clusters during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Solidago pyramidata is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
