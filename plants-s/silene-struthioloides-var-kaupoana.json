    "intro": "Silene struthioloides var. kaupoana, commonly known as the Kaupoan catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
