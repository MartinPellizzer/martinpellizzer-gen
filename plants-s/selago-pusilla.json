    "intro": "Selago pusilla, commonly known as the small sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal areas. It has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Selago pusilla is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
