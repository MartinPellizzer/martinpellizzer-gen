    "intro": "Sesuvium trianthemoides, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in saline and arid environments, making it well adapted to coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
