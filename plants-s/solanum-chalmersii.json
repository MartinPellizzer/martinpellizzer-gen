    "intro": "Solanum chalmersii, commonly known as the Chalmers' nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
