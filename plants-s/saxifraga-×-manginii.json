    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 manginii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
