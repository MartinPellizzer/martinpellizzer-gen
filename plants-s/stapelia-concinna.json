    "intro": "Stapelia concinna, commonly known as the starry stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia concinna is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
