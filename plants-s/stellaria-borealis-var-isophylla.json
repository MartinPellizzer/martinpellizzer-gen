It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
