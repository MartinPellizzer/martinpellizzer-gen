    "intro": "Striga aequinoctialis, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize and sorghum. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is a significant agricultural pest in Africa. Its life cycle involves producing copious amounts of seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years. Due to its invasive nature and impact on food security, Striga aequinoctialis remains a major challenge in sustainable agriculture."
