    "intro": "Sacoglottis guianensis var. maior, commonly known as the giant sacoglottis, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of South America. This plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. The flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to researchers studying tropical plant diversity."
