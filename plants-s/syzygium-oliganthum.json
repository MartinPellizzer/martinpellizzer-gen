    "intro": "Syzygium oliganthum, commonly known as the rare or ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropics of northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
