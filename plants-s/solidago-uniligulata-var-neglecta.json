    "intro": "Solidago uniligulata var. neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. This variant of Solidago uniligulata is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland environment, with a robust root system and efficient water uptake mechanisms."
