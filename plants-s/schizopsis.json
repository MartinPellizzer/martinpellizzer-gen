    "intro": "Schizopsis, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their woody stems and opposite leaves. Schizopsis species produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage and floral display."
