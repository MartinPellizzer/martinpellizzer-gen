    "intro": "Selliguea oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette or overlapping pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are exposed and can be found on the upper surface of the leaves. Selliguea oblongifolia plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
