    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, broadly ovate to triangular leaves with wavy, toothed margins and a distinctive milky sap. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
