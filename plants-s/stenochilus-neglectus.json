It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white and yellow. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known for commercial horticulture."
