    "intro": "Sida abutilifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Sida abutilifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural settings."
