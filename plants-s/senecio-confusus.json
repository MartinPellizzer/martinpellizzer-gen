    "intro": "Senecio confusus, commonly known as the confused groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and has hairy, branching stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are alternate, with a rough texture and a distinctive, slightly lobed shape. Senecio confusus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
