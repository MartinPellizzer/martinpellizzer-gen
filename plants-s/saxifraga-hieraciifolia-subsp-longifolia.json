    "intro": "Saxifraga hieraciifolia subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often lobed and resemble the leaves of the common yarrow. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
