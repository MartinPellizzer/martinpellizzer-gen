    "intro": "Senecio infestus, commonly known as the stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
