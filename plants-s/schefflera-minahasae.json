It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black, spherical berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
