    "intro": "Sideroxylon capiri, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a hardy, evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
