    "intro": "Scabiosa turolensis subsp. weyleri, commonly known as the Turolensis scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It has slender, branched stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
