    "intro": "Sulcorebutia viridis, commonly known as the green cushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stems. Its unique appearance and easy care make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
