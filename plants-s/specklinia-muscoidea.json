It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually light green and have a soft, velvety texture. Specklinia muscoidea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
