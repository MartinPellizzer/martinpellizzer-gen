    "intro": "Sapium cornutum var. genuinum, commonly known as the horned cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive, hollow, horn-like stem that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. This species thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
