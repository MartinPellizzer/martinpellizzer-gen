    "intro": "Sida oxyodon, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in coastal dunes. Its fibrous stems and leaves are used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities. Sida oxyodon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small wildlife."
