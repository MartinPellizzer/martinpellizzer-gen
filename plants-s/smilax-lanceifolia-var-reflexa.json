    "intro": "Smilax lanceifolia var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five lance-shaped leaflets, often with a reflexed (curled inward) margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
