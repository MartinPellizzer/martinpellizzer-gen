    "intro": "Stenostomum aromaticum, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Southeast Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are valued for their medicinal properties, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Stenostomum aromaticum thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks."
