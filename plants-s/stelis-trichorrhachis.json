    "intro": "Stelis trichorrhachis, commonly known as the hairy root stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its climbing structure. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip. Its roots are covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in moisture absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose potting media for optimal growth."
