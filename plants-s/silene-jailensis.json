    "intro": "Silene jailensis, commonly known as the Jail Mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Silene jailensis is often found in alpine meadows and is known for its small, hairy leaves. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
