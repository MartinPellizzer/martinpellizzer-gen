    "intro": "Scleranthus \u00d7 conocephalus, commonly known as the hybrid common thornweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Scleranthus arvensis and Scleranthus conocephalus, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are often hairy and lance-shaped. Due to its hybrid nature, it is less commonly cultivated but can be found in wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects."
