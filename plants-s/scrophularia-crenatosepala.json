It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with wavy edges. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pale pink to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Scrophularia crenatosepala is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
