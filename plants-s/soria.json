    "intro": "Soria, commonly known as the common spleenwort, is a type of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant features a delicate, creeping rhizome with simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Soria reproduces via spores, which are released from tiny, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
