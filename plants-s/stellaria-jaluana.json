    "intro": "Stellaria jaluana, commonly known as the lesser starwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem. Stellaria jaluana is typically herbaceous, with a low-growing habit and is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
