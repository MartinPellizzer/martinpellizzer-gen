It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its grayish bark and slender, pendulous branches. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands."
