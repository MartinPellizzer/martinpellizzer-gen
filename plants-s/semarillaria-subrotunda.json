It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a woody stem with rough, hairy surfaces and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
