    "intro": "Scleranthus sulcifer, commonly known as the grooved sand-rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinct groove running along their length, giving it its scientific name. Scleranthus sulcifer is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
