    "intro": "Swartzia similis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Swartzia similis is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and fine furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in its native range."
