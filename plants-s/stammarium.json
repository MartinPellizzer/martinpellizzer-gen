    "intro": "Stammarium, commonly known as the \"flower of the desert,\" is a rare and unique plant native to arid regions. It features a compact, shrub-like structure with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. Stammarium is adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
