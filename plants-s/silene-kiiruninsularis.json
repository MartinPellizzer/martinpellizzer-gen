    "intro": "Silene kiiruninsularis, commonly known as the Kiiru Island catchfly, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote Kiiru Islands in the southern Pacific. It is a low-growing herb with delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has small, hairy leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its island habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
