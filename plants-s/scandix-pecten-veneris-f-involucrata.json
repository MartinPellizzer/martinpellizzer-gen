    "intro": "Scandix pecten-veneris f. involucrata, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flower heads that resemble the shell of the Venus flower basket. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in salty environments. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and coastal landscapes."
