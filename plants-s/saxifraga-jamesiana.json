    "intro": "Saxifraga jamesiana, commonly known as the James's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Saxifraga jamesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand cold and arid conditions."
