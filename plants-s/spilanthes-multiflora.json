    "intro": "Spilanthes multiflora, commonly known as the Indian mustard or stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has a pungent, mustard-like odor, which is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Spilanthes multiflora is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and roadsides."
