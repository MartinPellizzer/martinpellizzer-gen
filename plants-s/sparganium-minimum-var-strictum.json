    "intro": "Sparganium minimum var. strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bur-reed, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiky, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. This species plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
