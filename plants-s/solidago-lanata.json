    "intro": "Solidago lanata, commonly known as the woolly goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fluffy, silver-white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Solidago lanata is a hardy perennial that plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
