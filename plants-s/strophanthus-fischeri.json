    "intro": "Strophanthus fischeri, commonly known as the red African lily, is a striking flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a climbing shrub that produces vibrant orange-red flowers, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also have historical uses in traditional medicine. However, the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if mishandled."
