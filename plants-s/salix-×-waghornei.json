    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 waghornei, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the United Kingdom. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
