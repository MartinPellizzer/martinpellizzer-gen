    "intro": "Sclerandrium grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems covered in a thick layer of bark, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Sclerandrium grandiflorum is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas."
