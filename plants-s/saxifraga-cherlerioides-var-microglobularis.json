    "intro": "Saxifraga cherlerioides var. microglobularis, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
