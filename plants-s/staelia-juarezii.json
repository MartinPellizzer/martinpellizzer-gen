    "intro": "Staelia juarezii, commonly known as the Mexican starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its striking yellow and white petals make it a visually appealing species, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
