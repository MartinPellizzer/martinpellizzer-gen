    "intro": "Stellaria domingensis, commonly known as the starwort, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas within tropical forests. Stellaria domingensis is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
