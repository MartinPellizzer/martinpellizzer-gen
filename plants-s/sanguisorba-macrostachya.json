It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that are often tinged with red, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, rose-purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicle inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and they are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. Sanguisorba macrostachya is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
