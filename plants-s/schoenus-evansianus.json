    "intro": "Schoenus evansianus, commonly known as the bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or floating in water. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Schoenus evansianus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
