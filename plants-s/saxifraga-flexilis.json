    "intro": "Saxifraga flexilis, commonly known as the flexible saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water in harsh conditions. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Saxifraga flexilis is often found in open, sunny areas and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
