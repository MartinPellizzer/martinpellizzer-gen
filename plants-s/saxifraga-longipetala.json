    "intro": "Saxifraga longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features upright stems with basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. Saxifraga longipetala is valued for its resilience and is often found in mountainous regions where few other plants can survive."
