    "intro": "Stellaria viridiflora, commonly known as greenflower starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. Stellaria viridiflora is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
