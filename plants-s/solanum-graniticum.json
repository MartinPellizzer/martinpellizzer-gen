    "intro": "Solanum graniticum, commonly known as the granite tomato, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tomato-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, which is reflected in its common name. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Solanum graniticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and medicinal properties."
