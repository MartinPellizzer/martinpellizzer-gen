    "intro": "Sium patulum, commonly known as broad-leaved water-plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas. Sium patulum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and contributing to water filtration."
