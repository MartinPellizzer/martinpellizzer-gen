    "intro": "Senecio rugosus, commonly known as the roughleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Senecio rugosus is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
