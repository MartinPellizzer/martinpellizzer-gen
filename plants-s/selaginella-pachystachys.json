It is a perennial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with spirally arranged leaves that are often clustered at the nodes. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores for propagation.
