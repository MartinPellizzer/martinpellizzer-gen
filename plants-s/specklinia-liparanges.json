    "intro": "Specklinia liparanges, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to absorb moisture from the air. Specklinia liparanges is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
