    "intro": "Stevia selloi var. typica, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that contain high levels of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often harvested and used as a sugar substitute due to their intense sweetness and low caloric content. Stevia selloi var. typica is also valued for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
