    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and narrower compared to other willow species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
