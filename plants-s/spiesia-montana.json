    "intro": "Spiesia montana, commonly known as mountain spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. Spiesia montana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
