    "intro": "Serpicula veronicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a silvery-gray appearance due to a thick layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Serpicula veronicifolia is adapted to dry conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
