    "intro": "Symplocos citrea, commonly known as the white-flowered evergreen or Indian bladdernut, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that turn red when mature. Symplocos citrea is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
