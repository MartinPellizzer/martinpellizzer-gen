    "intro": "Schizoglossum heterophyllum var. majus, commonly known as the giant desert bell, is a striking member of the Loasaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its large, showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red throat. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with thick, woody stems and leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal moths, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions."
