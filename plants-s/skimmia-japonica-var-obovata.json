    "intro": "Skimmia japonica var. obovata, commonly known as Japanese skimmia, is a shrub native to East Asia. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are leathery to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and seasonal floral display."
