It is a member of the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
