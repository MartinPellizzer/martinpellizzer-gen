    "intro": "Scoparia millefoliolata f. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping yarrow, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. It typically features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
