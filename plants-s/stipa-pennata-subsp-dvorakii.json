    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. dvorakii, commonly known as the Dvorak's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, wind-swaying appearance."
