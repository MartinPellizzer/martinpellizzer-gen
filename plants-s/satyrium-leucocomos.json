It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive white tip, which are arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in wetland habitats and is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils.
