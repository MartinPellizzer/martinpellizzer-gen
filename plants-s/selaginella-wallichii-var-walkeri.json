    "intro": "Selaginella wallichii var. walkeri, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that produce upright, grass-like shoots, which give it the common name. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including India and China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a spiral pattern, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
