    "intro": "Salmiopuntia, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts moths. Salmiopuntia species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil, making them suitable for arid environments. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
