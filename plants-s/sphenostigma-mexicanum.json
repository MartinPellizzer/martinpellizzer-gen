    "intro": "Sphenostigma mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in specialized clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphenostigma mexicanum is considered a species of conservation concern."
