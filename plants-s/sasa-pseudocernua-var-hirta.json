    "intro": "Sasa pseudocernua var. hirta, commonly known as hairy bamboo, is a variant of the sasa bamboo species native to East Asia. It is a clump-forming perennial grass that grows in dense, compact clusters, often forming thickets in shaded forest environments. The plant features slender, cylindrical culms that are covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue with a slightly rough texture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for erosion control and landscape design."
