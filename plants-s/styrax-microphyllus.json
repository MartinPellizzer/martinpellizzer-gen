    "intro": "Styrax microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Styrax microphyllus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
