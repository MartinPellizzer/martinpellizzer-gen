Its stem is sturdy and upright, supporting the foliage and facilitating photosynthesis. The plant exhibits a specialized root system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is native to specific regions with high humidity and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to aquatic conditions."
