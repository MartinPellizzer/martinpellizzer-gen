    "intro": "Stapelia variegata var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the Purple-stemmed Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically purple or reddish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
