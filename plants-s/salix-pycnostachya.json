    "intro": "Salix pycnostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Salix pycnostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
