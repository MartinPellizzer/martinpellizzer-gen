    "intro": "Sisymbrium truncatum, commonly known as the truncate broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant typically has a hairy stem and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
