    "intro": "Senecio antambolorum, commonly known as the Antambola groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are yellow and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
