    "intro": "Schoepfia griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's schoepfia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and northern India. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
