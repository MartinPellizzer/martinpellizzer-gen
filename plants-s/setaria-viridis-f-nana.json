It is characterized by its short stature and dense, tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental use. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous greenish-brown bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, exhibiting rapid growth during the warmer months. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and as a cover crop in agricultural settings."
