It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. It produces small, nutlet-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.
