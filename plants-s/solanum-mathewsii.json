    "intro": "Solanum mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
