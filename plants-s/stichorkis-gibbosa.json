    "intro": "Stichorkis gibbosa, commonly known as the warty sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically has a compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or rocky soils. Stichorkis gibbosa is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
