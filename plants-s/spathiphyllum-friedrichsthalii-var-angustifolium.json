    "intro": "Spathiphyllum friedrichsthalii var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Central America. It features broad, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the standard peace lily, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, spathe-like flowers that are typical of the Spathiphyllum genus. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate moisture and humidity. Its foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
