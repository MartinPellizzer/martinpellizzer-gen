    "intro": "Selaginella culverwellii, commonly known as Culverwell's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with whorled leaves. The plant features a distinct sporophyte stage with a short, thick stem and cone-like structures that produce spores. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, and they often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Selaginella culverwellii is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
