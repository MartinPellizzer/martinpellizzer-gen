    "intro": "Sparganium simplex var. multipedunculatum, commonly known as the many-branched burr rush, is a wetland plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spiky, reddish-brown seed heads. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into the distinctive burr-like structures. This variant is distinguished by its multiple peduncles, which contribute to its common name and enhance its ecological role in aquatic habitats."
