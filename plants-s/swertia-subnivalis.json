    "intro": "Swertia subnivalis, commonly known as the snow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Swertia subnivalis is adapted to survive in extreme climates with short growing seasons and low temperatures."
