It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils along tidal zones, often found in intertidal habitats. Its leaves are linear and somewhat succulent, adapted to withstand saline conditions. Scopellaria marginata var. penangense plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
