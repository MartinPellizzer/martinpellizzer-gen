It is characterized by its cascading clusters of white, fluffy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its foliage is typically dark green, turning reddish in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
