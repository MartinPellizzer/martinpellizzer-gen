It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
