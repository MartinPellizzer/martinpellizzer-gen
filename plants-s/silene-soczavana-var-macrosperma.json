    "intro": "Silene soczavana var. macrosperma, commonly known as the Soczawa mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
