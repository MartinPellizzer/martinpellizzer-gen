It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, and it prefers well-drained, moist soils. Spathoglottis grandifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
