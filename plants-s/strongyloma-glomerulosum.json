    "intro": "Strongyloma glomerulosum, commonly known as the clustered bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Strongyloma glomerulosum is often found in association with other members of the mustard family, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
