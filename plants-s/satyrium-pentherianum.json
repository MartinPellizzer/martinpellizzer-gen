    "intro": "Satyrium pentherianum, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
