    "intro": "Sphalanthus ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture and stabilize the soil. Sphalanthus ovatifolia is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
