    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 kestonensis, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, broadly ovate leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock gardens. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus."
