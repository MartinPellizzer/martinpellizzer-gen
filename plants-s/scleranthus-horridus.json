    "intro": "Scleranthus horridus, commonly known as the bristly sand-rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Scleranthus horridus is an annual or biennial plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
