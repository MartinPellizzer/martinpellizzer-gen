    "intro": "Schefflera lanceolata, commonly known as the lance-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like foliage composed of large, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its adaptability and attractive appearance make it a favored ornamental plant in both tropical and subtropical regions."
