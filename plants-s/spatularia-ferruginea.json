    "intro": "Spatularia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusted spatula fungus, is a member of the family Marasmiaceae. It is a small, saprophytic fungus that typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in forested areas. The cap is spatula-shaped, with a reddish-brown coloration that becomes more intense with age. Its gills are closely spaced and initially pale, turning brown as the fungus matures. Spatularia ferruginea is often found in humid environments and is not considered edible due to its bitter taste and potential toxicity."
