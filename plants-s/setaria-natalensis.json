    "intro": "Setaria natalensis, commonly known as Natal millet, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Natal millet is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in traditional agriculture and forage."
