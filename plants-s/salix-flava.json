    "intro": "Salix flava, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
