    "intro": "Schefflera subavenis var. brachybotrya, commonly known as the compact schefflera, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded growth habit with multiple stems arising from the base. The leaves are typically thick, glossy, and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange-red berries. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and tolerance of low light conditions."
