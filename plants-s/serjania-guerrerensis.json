    "intro": "Serjania guerrerensis, commonly known as the Guerrerense serjania, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly found in regions of Guatemala and Honduras. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with thick, woody stems and elliptical leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serjania guerrerensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
