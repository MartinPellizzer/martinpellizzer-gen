    "intro": "Scabiosa maritima var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy seaside scabious, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to coastal gardens. The variety 'villosa' is distinguished by its dense, woolly hairs on the leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
