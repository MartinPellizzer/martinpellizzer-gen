    "intro": "Sideroxylon nitidum, commonly known as the smooth ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and glossy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and woodlands. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
