    "intro": "Saribus, commonly known as the sago palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The trunk is composed of a spongy, starchy material called sago, which has been historically used as a food source. Saribus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and for the production of palm wine."
