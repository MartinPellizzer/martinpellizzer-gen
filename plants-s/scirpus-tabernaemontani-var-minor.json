It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and narrow, ribbed leaves. This variety typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
