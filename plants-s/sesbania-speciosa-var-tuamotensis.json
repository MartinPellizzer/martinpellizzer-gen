    "intro": "Sesbania speciosa var. tuamotensis, commonly known as the Tuamotu sesbania, is a tropical legume native to the French Polynesian islands. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Sesbania genus. The plant grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across the region."
