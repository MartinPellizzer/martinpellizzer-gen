    "intro": "Spergularia diandra var. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in spring. Its roots are adapted to thrive in sandy soils, and it is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate salt and drought, making it a common plant in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
