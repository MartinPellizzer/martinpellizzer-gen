    "intro": "Scirpus inundatus var. pseudosetaceus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes help in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in wetland environments."
