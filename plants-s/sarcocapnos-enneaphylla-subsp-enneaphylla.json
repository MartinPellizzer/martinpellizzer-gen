It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls of nine, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands."
