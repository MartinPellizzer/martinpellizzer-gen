It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing flat, dark seeds. Swartzia marginata is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
