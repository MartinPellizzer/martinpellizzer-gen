    "intro": "Sisymbrella aspera subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The subspecies boissieri is distinguished by its more rugged appearance compared to the typical form of Sisymbrella aspera."
