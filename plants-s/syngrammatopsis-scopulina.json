It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. This species thrives on rocky substrates, particularly in dry, sunny environments. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats on stone surfaces. Syngrammatopsis scopulina plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
