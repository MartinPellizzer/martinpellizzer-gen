    "intro": "Saurauia scabra f. veranii, commonly known as the rough saurauia, is a rare plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its rugged, bark-like stem and small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky slopes or forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
