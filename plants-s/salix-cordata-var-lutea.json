    "intro": "Salix cordata var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. The yellow willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
