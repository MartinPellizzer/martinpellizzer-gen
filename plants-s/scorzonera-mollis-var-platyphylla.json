    "intro": "Scorzonera mollis var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust taproot that is often harvested for its edible qualities, though it is less commonly cultivated than other varieties of scorzonera. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a rough texture that aids in water retention in arid environments. Scorzonera mollis var. platyphylla is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows."
