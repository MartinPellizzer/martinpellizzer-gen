    "intro": "Stapelia indocta, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies for pollination. Its flowers open in the evening and close during the day, a trait known as nyctinasty. Stapelia indocta is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
