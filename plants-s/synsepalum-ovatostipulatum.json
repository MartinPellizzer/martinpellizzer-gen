It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. The fruit is often harvested when it turns a pale yellow or red, and it has a sweet, tangy flavor with a texture similar to a pear. It is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local communities."
