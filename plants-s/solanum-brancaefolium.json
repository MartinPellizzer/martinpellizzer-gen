    "intro": "Solanum brancaefolium, commonly known as the branched-leaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its branched stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in summer, followed by yellowish berries that contain toxic compounds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic nature, it is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
