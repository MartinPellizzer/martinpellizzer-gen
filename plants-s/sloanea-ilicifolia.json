    "intro": "Sloanea ilicifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved sloanea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Sloanea ilicifolia produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, and it is often found in lowland and montane forests. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
