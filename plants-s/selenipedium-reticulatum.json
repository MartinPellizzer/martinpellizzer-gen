    "intro": "Selenipedium reticulatum, commonly known as the netted selenipedium, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a distinctive net-like pattern on the underside. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Selenipedium reticulatum is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
