    "intro": "Scirpus subcapitatus var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its triangular, ribbed stems that often grow in dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
