It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, silky hair that gives it its common name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction. This plant is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
