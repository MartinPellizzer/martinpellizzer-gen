    "intro": "Saccolabium hoyopse, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Saccolabium hoyopse is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
