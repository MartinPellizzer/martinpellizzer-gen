    "intro": "Sapindus divaricatus, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a starchy, soap-like pulp. Its leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, and the fruit is used as a natural soap due to its saponin content. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
