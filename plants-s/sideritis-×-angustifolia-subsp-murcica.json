It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pink to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
