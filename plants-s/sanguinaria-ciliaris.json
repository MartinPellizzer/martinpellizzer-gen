    "intro": "Sanguinaria ciliaris, commonly known as the red puccoon, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a stout, thick rhizome that stores nutrients and helps it survive harsh winters. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a reddish tint along the edges. Sanguinaria ciliaris is also notable for its toxic sap, which has been used historically in traditional medicine."
