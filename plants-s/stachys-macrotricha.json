    "intro": "Stachys macrotricha, commonly known as the large-leaf betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of purple to pink flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Stachys macrotricha is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
