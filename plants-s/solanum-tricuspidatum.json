    "intro": "Solanum tricuspidatum, commonly known as the three-lobed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, green berries, which turn red when mature. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires caution when handling."
