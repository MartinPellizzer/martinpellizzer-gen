    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. alpina, commonly known as alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variant is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in supporting pollinators in mountain ecosystems."
