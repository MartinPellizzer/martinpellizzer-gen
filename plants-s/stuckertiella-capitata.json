    "intro": "Stuckertiella capitata, commonly known as the clustered sticktight fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stuckertiella capitata is an annual herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
