    "intro": "Sideroxylon rugosum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful for construction and furniture. Sideroxylon rugosum is also known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and its role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
