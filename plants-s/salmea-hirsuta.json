    "intro": "Salmea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy salmea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its root system is adapted to retain moisture, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Salmea hirsuta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
