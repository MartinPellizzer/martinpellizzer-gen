    "intro": "Schoenomorphus, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often showy flowers that resemble those of true orchids, though it is not closely related. The plants typically have a short, stocky rhizome and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and they produce small, clustered flowers in various colors. Schoenomorphus species are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid environments."
