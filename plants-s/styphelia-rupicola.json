    "intro": "Styphelia rupicola, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitat. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural setting. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in heathland environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
