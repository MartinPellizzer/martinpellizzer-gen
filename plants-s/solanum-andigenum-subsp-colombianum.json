    "intro": "Solanum andigenum subsp. colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian potato plant, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Colombia, and thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, tuberous roots that are used as a food source by local communities. Its foliage contains alkaloids, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for crop improvement and adaptation to harsh climates."
