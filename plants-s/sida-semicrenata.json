    "intro": "Sida semicrenata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Sida semicrenata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
