It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, during the spring season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and streams. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Salicaceae family."
