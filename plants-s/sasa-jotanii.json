It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its stiff, narrow leaves and woody rhizomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its culms are slender and often used in traditional crafts and as a food source in some cultures. Sasa jotanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in forest ecosystems."
