It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and compound leaves with ovate leaflets. Its most distinctive feature is the bright orange, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, the plant is considered poisonous and should be handled with care."
