    "intro": "Salvia chamelaeagnea, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and vibrant blooms make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in desert ecosystems."
