    "intro": "Spiranthes camposnovensis, commonly known as the Campo Novo Ladies' Tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the grasslands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil. Its root system consists of a rhizome that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
