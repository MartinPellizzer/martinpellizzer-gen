    "intro": "Salvia vaseyi, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Salvia vaseyi is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
