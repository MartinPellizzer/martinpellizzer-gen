The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists interested in South African flora."
