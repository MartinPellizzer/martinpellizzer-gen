    "intro": "Stevia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Stevia stenophylla is also valued for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits."
