    "intro": "Salix smithiana, commonly known as Smith's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant features slender, flexible stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Smith's willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
