    "intro": "Sapranthus palanga var. santae-rosae, commonly known as the Santa Rosa sapranthus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of California. It is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the dunes and coastal bluffs, where it is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
