    "intro": "Spartium scoparium, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring. Its seeds are encased in a bristly, spiky capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. Spartium scoparium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
