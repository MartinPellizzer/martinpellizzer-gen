    "intro": "Sorbus chamaemespilus f. discolor, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green leaves that contrast with its dark green or red stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
