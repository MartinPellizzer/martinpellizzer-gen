    "intro": "Stapelia variegata var. brevicornis, commonly known as the variegated star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and unique appearance."
