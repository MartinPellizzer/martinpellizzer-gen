    "intro": "Stelis warszewiczii, commonly known as the Warszewicz's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis warszewiczii is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests."
