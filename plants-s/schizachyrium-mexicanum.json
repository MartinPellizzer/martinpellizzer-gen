    "intro": "Schizachyrium mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purplish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Schizachyrium mexicanum is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
