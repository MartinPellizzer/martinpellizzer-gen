It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are narrow and deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique leaf structure helps it conserve water, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
