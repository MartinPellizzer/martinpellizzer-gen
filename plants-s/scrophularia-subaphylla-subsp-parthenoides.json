    "intro": "Scrophularia subaphylla subsp. parthenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and hairy foliage, which help it adapt to arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
