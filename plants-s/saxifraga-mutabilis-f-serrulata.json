It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically serrated or toothed, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. This frost-tolerant species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
