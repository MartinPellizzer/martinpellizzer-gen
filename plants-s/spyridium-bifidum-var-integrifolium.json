It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth margin, distinguishing it from other varieties of Spyridium. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
