    "intro": "Stylocoryna ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Stylocoryna ovata is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
