    "intro": "Salsola crassa subsp. longipistillata, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its roots are extensive and capable of stabilizing sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in desert ecosystems. Salsola crassa subsp. longipistillata is adapted to high temperatures, low precipitation, and poor soil conditions."
