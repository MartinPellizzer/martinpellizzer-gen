    "intro": "Symplocos ascidiiformis, commonly known as the bladderleaf sand-verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny seeds. Symplocos ascidiiformis is adapted to arid and rocky habitats, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
