    "intro": "Solanum clarum, commonly known as the clear nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that are often clustered together, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth texture. Solanum clarum is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet berries that develop after the flowers fade. Like many members of its family, it contains alkaloids, which can make it toxic if ingested."
