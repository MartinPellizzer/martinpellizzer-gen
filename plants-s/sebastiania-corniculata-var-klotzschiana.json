    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. klotzschiana, commonly known as the Klotzschian firecracker tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red, tubular flowers that resemble firecrackers, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its vibrant floral display."
