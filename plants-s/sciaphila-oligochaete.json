    "intro": "Sciaphila oligochaete, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in the understory of dense forests. The plant has slender, pale green stems and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of biodiversity in fragile ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is also considered an endangered species."
