    "intro": "Sonchus pruinatus, commonly known as the silverleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. While considered a weed in some regions, it has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
