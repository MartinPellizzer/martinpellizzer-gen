    "intro": "Synstemonanthus, commonly known as the golden torch lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that resemble torches, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. Synstemonanthus species are typically herbaceous perennials with strap-like leaves and a short, erect stem. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral display."
