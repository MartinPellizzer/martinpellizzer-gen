    "intro": "Salix pseudogrisea, commonly known as the grey willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
