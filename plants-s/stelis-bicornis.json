It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Stelis bicornis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
