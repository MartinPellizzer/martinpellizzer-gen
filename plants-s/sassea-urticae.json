    "intro": "Sassea urticae, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant contains irritant chemicals called urticating hairs, which cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. Sassea urticae is typically found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in temperate climates. It plays a role in supporting various pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
