    "intro": "Stelis millei, commonly known as the Mille's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Stelis millei is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and greenhouse settings."
