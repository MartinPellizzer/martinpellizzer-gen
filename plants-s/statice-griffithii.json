    "intro": "Statice griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to salty, windy environments and often thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Statice griffithii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
