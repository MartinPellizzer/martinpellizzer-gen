    "intro": "Selaginella fulvicaulis, commonly known as the golden thread moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized cells that can enter a dormant state. Its sporophyte stage is short-lived, and it produces spores in structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. Selaginella fulvicaulis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
