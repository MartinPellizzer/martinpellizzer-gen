    "intro": "Salacia regeliana, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of East Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its dense clusters of white, fleshy flowers. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in montane forests. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, hard seeds enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like capsule."
