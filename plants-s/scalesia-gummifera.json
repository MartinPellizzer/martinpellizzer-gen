    "intro": "Scalesia gummifera, commonly known as the gummed scaleia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance from its stems, which gives it its common name. It thrives in the volcanic soil and humid climate of the Gal\u00e1pagos, often growing in coastal areas. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary biology."
