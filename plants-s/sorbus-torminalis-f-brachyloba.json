    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-leaf whitebeam, is a compact, shrub-like form of the European whitebeam. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries in the autumn. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and compact growth habit."
