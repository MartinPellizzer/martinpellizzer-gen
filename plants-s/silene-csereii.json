    "intro": "Silene csereii, commonly known as the Cserei's campion, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian region of Central Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers with five petals, arranged in a raceme, during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid environment. Silene csereii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
