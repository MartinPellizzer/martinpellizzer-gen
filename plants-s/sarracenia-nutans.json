    "intro": "Sarracenia nutans, commonly known as the nodding pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its downward-curving, urn-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with a waxy coating that helps in trapping prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Sarracenia nutans is an important species in wetland ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling through its insectivorous habits."
