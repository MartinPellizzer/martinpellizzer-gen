    "intro": "Stevia hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. Due to its unique flavor and health benefits, it has gained interest for use in herbal teas and as a natural sweetener alternative."
