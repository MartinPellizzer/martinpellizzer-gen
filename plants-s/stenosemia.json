    "intro": "Stenosemia, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow flowers that resemble cascading showers, hence their common name. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Stenosemia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They often grow as shrubs or small trees, and their rapid growth makes them popular for ornamental landscaping."
