It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Sambucus palmensis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils."
