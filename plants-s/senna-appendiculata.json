    "intro": "Senna appendiculata, commonly known as the golden senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and contain compounds that have been studied for their medicinal properties. Senna appendiculata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
