It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are essential for its propagation. Selaginella martensii is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
