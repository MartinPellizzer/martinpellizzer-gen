    "intro": "Sabulina velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sabulina velenovskyi is considered a rare and specialized species."
