    "intro": "Sideroxylon arnhemicum, commonly known as the Arnhem ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
