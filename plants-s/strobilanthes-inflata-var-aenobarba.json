    "intro": "Strobilanthes inflata var. aenobarba, commonly known as the hairy-stalked flameflower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
