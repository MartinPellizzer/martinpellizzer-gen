    "intro": "Shorea furfuracea, commonly known as the white teak, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has a straight trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds."
