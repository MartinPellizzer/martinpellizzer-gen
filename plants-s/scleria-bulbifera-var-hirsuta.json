    "intro": "Scleria bulbifera var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bulbfera grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features hairy, cylindrical stems that often bear clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant produces bulb-like structures at the base of its stems, which can act as storage organs or propagate new plants. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams."
