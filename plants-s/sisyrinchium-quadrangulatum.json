    "intro": "Sisyrinchium quadrangulatum, commonly known as the four-angled blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is not a true grass. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a distinct four-sided stem that gives it its scientific name. Sisyrinchium quadrangulatum is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies."
