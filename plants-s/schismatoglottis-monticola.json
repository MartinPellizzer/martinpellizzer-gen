    "intro": "Schismatoglottis monticola, commonly known as the mountain schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and strikingly colored, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, red, and purple. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it is noted for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Schismatoglottis monticola is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
