    "intro": "Symplocos angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf waxberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. Symplocos angustata is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in eastern North American forests."
