    "intro": "Strychnos kawbet, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which make it highly poisonous to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine in some regions, though with great caution."
