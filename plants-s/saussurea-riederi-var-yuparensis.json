It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant is known for its tall, slender stems and dense, hairy foliage that helps it survive in cold and arid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically yellow or white, adding to the ecological diversity of its mountainous habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
