    "intro": "Solanum molestum, commonly known as the stinging nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The berries contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges."
