    "intro": "Schultesia hederacea, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Schultesia hederacea thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in certain ecosystems."
