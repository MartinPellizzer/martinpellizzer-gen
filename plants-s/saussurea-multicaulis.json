    "intro": "Saussurea multicaulis, commonly known as the Chinese yarrow or the Himalayan saussurea, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spherical inflorescences composed of numerous small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine."
