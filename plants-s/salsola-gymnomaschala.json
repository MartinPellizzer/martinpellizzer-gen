    "intro": "Salsola gymnomaschala, commonly known as desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its spiny branches and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by small, bead-like fruits. Salsola gymnomaschala is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
