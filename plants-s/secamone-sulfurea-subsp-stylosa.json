    "intro": "Secamone sulfurea subsp. stylosa, commonly known as the yellow secamone, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and opposite, and the flowers are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies stylosa is distinguished by its elongated floral bracts and slightly different growth habits compared to other subspecies of Secamone sulfurea."
