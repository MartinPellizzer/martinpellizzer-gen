    "intro": "Scleria chimborazensis, commonly known as the Andean spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native range. Scleria chimborazensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its ecological niche and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
