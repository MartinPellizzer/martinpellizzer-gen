    "intro": "Senecio scopulorum, commonly known as the rock senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
