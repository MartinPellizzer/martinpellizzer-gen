    "intro": "Sanicula orthacantha var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined sanicula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds upon maturity. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in forest understory communities."
