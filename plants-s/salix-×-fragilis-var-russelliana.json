    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. russelliana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that drape like waterfalls. It is native to eastern Europe and western Asia, though it is widely cultivated in temperate regions around the world. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. The Weeping Willow is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
