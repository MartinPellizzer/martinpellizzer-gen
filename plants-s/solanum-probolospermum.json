    "intro": "Solanum probolospermum, commonly known as the golden nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its fruits are small, yellow berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
