    "intro": "Sempervivum borisii var. ciliosum, commonly known as the Corsican stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the island of Corsica. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The leaves are typically adorned with white or pale blue marginal cilia, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. This hardy plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
