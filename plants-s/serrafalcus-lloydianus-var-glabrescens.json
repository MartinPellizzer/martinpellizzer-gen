    "intro": "Serrafalcus lloydianus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous serrafalcus, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, almost imperceptible layer of hair. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. This variant is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) appearance, which sets it apart from other varieties of Serrafalcus lloydianus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native environment."
