    "intro": "Scirpus excelsus, commonly known as tall bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and is important for wetland ecosystems. Scirpus excelsus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water."
