    "intro": "Senecio elquiensis, commonly known as the Elqui Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the coast, where it thrives in a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and mild, wet winters. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, are arranged in dense clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
