    "intro": "Scleria bulusanensis, commonly known as the Bulusan scleria, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
