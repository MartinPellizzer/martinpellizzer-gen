    "intro": "Stellaria longifolia var. hispidula, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine, stiff hairs that give the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats in suitable conditions."
