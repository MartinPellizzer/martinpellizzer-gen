    "intro": "Sida viarum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sida viarum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is an annual herb that can spread rapidly, making it a common weed in many regions."
