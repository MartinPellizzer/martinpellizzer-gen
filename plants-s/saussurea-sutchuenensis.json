    "intro": "Saussurea sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Sichuan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flower heads. The plant produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its roots are often harvested for traditional medicinal uses, valued for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
