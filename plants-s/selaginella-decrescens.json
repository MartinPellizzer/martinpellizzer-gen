It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella decrescens is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and evolution."
