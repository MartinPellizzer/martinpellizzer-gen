    "intro": "Salix schugnanica f. caloclados, commonly known as the caloclados willow, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely hairy, especially on the underside. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense shrubs or small trees. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically yellow-green and appear in early spring. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
