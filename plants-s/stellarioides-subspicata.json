    "intro": "Stellarioides subspicata, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The plant thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in these harsh climates and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Stellarioides subspicata is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
