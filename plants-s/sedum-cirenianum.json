    "intro": "Sedum cirenianum, commonly known as the Arctic sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to northern regions. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
