    "intro": "Salix alpestrivaga, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
