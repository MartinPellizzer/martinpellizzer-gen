It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are oval-shaped and slightly succulent, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
