    "intro": "Salpichroa rhomboidea var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy (pubescent) stems and leaves provide protection against intense sunlight and water loss. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
