    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 radiata, commonly known as the star stapelia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with minimal water. Stapelia \u00d7 radiata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
