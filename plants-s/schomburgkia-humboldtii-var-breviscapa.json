    "intro": "Schomburgkia humboldtii var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed Schomburgkia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It features broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the wet season. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively short, sturdy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
