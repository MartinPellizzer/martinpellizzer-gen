    "intro": "Salvia confertiflora, commonly known as the clustered sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Salvia confertiflora is also a food source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
