    "intro": "Sarothamnus scoparius subvar. andreanus, commonly known as the Andreean thimbleweed, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
