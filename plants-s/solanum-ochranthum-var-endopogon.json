It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals and has hairy stems and leaves. It is native to parts of Central and South America and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not suitable for human consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
