    "intro": "Salix alba nothof. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a hybrid species that combines traits from Salix alba and Salix pendula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a light green color during the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion."
