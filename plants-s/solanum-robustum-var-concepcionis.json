    "intro": "Solanum robustum var. concepcionis, commonly known as the Concepcion nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to purple, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
