    "intro": "Solena latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf solena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Solena latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
