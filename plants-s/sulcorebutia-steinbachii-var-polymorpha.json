    "intro": "Sulcorebutia steinbachii var. polymorpha, commonly known as the variegated rock rose, is a compact, flowering cactus native to South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a desirable addition to collections of succulents and cacti."
