    "intro": "Silene acaulis subsp. norica, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically on short, erect stalks. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions across Central and Eastern Europe."
