    "intro": "Stelis aberrans, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, linear leaves and produces delicate, pendulous flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its inflorescence is characterized by a zigzag or spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. Stelis aberrans thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity for optimal growth."
