    "intro": "Sorbus pruinosa, commonly known as the white-leafed rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-white bark and pinnate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Sorbus pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
