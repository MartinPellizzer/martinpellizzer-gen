    "intro": "Selaginella calcicola, commonly known as the limestone spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in calcium-rich soils, often found in rocky or limestone substrates. Its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed or barren environments. Selaginella calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
