    "intro": "Stevia macvaughii, commonly known as the Hawaiian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant produces sweet-tasting leaves that contain steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
