    "intro": "Stellaria longipes lusus rigida, commonly known as the rigid starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often hairy. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in harsh environments and its use in ecological studies."
