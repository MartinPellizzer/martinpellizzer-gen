It is characterized by its solitary, showy petaled flower that resembles a small, delicate bell. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in water retention. The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and potential ecological significance."
