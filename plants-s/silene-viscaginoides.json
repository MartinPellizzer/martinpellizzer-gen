    "intro": "Silene viscaginoides, commonly known as the sticky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may aid in deterring herbivores. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Silene viscaginoides is a perennial species that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
