    "intro": "Stelis nigrescens, commonly known as the darkening orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest undergrowth. The plant has a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color. Its unique characteristic is the darkening of the flower petals as they mature, giving it its common name. Stelis nigrescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
