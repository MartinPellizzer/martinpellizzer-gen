    "intro": "Sorghum stipoideum, commonly known as the slender sorghum, is a tall, grass-like plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its fibrous stalks are often used for thatching or as a source of fiber. Sorghum stipoideum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and small animals."
