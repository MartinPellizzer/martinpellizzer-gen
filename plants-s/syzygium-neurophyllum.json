    "intro": "Syzygium neurophyllum, commonly known as the white-leaf tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its smooth, pale green to white leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Syzygium neurophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in indigenous cultures."
