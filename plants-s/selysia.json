    "intro": "Selysia, commonly known as the selysia orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Selysia species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers, which display a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink. The plants have fleshy roots and are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in local ecosystems."
