    "intro": "Symphoricarpos glaucus, commonly known as the white-fruited snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, white to pale green berries that persist through winter. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, which are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Symphoricarpos glaucus is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions."
