    "intro": "Sorbus cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that persist through winter. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
