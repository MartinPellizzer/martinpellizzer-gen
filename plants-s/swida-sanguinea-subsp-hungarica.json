    "intro": "Swida sanguinea subsp. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian red willow, is a rare subspecies native to parts of Central Europe. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its reddish-brown bark and elongated, willow-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting and ecologically significant species."
