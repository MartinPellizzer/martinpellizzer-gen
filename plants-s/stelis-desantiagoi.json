    "intro": "Stelis desantiagoi, commonly known as the Santiago orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis desantiagoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
