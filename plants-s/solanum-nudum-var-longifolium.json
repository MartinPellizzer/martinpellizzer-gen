    "intro": "Solanum nudum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, hairy stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into oval, yellowish berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
