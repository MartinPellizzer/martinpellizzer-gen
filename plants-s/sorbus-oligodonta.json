    "intro": "Sorbus oligodonta, commonly known as the Alaska whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
