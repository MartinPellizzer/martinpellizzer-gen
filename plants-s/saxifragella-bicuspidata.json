    "intro": "Saxifragella bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-lobed saxifrage, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Saxifragella bicuspidata is often found growing on rocky substrates and is an indicator species for cold, nutrient-poor habitats."
