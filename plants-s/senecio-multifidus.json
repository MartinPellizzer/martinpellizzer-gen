    "intro": "Senecio multifidus, commonly known as the narrowleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential to spread aggressively."
