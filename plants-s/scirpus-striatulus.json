    "intro": "Scirpus striatulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive striated pattern along the midrib, giving it its scientific name. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus striatulus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
