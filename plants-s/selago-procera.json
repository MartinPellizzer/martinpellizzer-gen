It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Selago procera is often used in dryland landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
