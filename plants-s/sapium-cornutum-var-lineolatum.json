    "intro": "Sapium cornutum var. lineolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese lantern, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its striking, papery, orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are borne on slender stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive serrated margin. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
