    "intro": "Stigmatopteris ichtiosma, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori that are clustered near the margins of the leaves."
