    "intro": "Saxifraga fusca var. divaricata, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
