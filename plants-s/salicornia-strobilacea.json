    "intro": "Salicornia strobilacea, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, giving it its species name \"strobilacea,\" meaning \"cone-like.\" It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats. Salicornia strobilacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
