    "intro": "Selenicereus inermis subsp. wercklei, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a climbing plant with a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
