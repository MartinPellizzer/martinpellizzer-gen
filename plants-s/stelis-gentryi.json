    "intro": "Stelis gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a raceme. Stelis gentryi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
