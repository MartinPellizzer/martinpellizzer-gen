    "intro": "Saxifraga stelleriana, commonly known as Steller's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Saxifraga stelleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
