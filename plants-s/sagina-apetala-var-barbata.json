    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. barbata, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species adapted to harsh environments."
