    "intro": "Schistostephium villosum, commonly known as the woolly stephanotis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as moths and bees. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, with a dense, bushy appearance. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
