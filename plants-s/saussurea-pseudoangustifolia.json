    "intro": "Saussurea pseudoangustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its native habitats."
