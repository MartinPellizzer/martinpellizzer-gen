    "intro": "Scutellaria racemosa, commonly known as bluebead lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and striking floral display. Scutellaria racemosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade."
