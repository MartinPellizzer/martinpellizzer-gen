    "intro": "Swartzia glabra, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Swartzia glabra is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
