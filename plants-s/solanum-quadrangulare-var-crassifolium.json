    "intro": "Solanum quadrangulare var. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Central and South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a distinctive quadrangular stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are initially green and turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
