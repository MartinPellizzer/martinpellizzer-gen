    "intro": "Silene chodatii var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ladies' tresses, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in areas with well-drained, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
