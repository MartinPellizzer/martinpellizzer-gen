    "intro": "Silene alpestris, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Silene alpestris is often found in meadows, scree slopes, and alpine tundra, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
