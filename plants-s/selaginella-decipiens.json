    "intro": "Selaginella decipiens, commonly known as the false spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stem, giving it a compact appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in small, cone-like structures called strobila. Selaginella decipiens is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptive species."
