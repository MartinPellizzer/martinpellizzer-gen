It consists of several species that are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants typically have basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. They produce showy, umbellate inflorescences with white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Styloceras species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
