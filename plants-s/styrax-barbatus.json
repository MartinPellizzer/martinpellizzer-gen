The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Styrax barbatus is also valued in traditional medicine for its resins and essential oils."
