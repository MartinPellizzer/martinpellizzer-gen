It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that are used for making furniture and handicrafts. The plant has pinnate leaves with long, slender leaflets, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered fruits. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
