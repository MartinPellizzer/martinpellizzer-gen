It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are elongated and have a finely serrated margin, often appearing dark green with a silvery underside. Salix \u00d7 paludum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
