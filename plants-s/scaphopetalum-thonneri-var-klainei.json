    "intro": "Scaphopetalum thonneri var. klainei, commonly known as the Klaine's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent sepals and petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and pale, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
