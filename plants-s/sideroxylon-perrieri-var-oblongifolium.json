It is characterized by its dense, dark wood and thick, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant is native to Madagascar and thrives in tropical dry forests. Its leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its hard wood and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species."
