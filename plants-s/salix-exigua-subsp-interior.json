    "intro": "Salix exigua subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
