    "intro": "Strophacanthus terminalis, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the dry season. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion along shorelines. Strophacanthus terminalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
