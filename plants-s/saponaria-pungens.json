    "intro": "Saponaria pungens, commonly known as the prickly soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is soapy in nature, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Saponaria pungens is sometimes used in gardens for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
