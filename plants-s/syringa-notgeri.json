    "intro": "Syringa notgeri, commonly known as the notger spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, providing an attractive contrast. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Syringa notgeri is valued for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
