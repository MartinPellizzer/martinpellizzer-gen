    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus subsp. affinis, commonly known as the saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in salty environments. The species plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
