    "intro": "Senegalia fiebrigii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Senegalia fiebrigii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
