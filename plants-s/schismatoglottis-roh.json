    "intro": "Schismatoglottis roh, commonly known as the Roh's lady's slipper, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are often pink or purple, with a distinctive pouch-like structure known as a labellum. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schismatoglottis roh is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
