    "intro": "Saxifraga rhei, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. Saxifraga rhei is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes. Its ability to thrive in poor soil and cold climates makes it a hardy and resilient species."
