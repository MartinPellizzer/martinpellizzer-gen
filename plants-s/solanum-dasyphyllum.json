    "intro": "Solanum dasyphyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or purple. The plant produces berries that range in color from yellow to red, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
