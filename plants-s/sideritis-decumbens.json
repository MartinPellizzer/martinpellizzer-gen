    "intro": "Sideritis decumbens, commonly known as creeping ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Sideritis decumbens is valued for its aromatic leaves, which have been used in traditional medicine for their mild sedative and antispasmodic properties."
