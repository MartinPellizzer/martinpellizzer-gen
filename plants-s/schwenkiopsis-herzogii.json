It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
