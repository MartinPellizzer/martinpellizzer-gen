    "intro": "Striga bilabiata subsp. barteri, commonly known as the barter's witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Its life cycle is closely linked to specific host species, and it can significantly impact agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in some regions and a challenge for sustainable farming."
