    "intro": "Sida accessiva, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Sida accessiva plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
