It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance.

Its ability to tolerate low light and varying moisture levels makes it a resilient and adaptable species."
