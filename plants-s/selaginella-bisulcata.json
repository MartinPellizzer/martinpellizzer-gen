    "intro": "Selaginella bisulcata, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with its segmented, club-like stems and spirally arranged leaves that give it a zigzag appearance. It is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures called strobila, which produce spores. Selaginella bisulcata is also notable for its resilience, as it can tolerate periods of drought and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
