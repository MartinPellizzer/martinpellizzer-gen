    "intro": "Sanguinaria acaulis, commonly known as the redroot or bloodroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red-orange sap, which is responsible for its common name and has been used historically for medicinal purposes. The plant features a single, sturdy stem with large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and red sepals, typically appearing in early spring. Sanguinaria acaulis thrives in moist, woodsy environments and is often found in shaded forest floors."
