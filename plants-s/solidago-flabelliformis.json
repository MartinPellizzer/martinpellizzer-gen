It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are usually arranged in a flat, fan-like pattern at the base of the plant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woods and meadows. Solidago flabelliformis is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
