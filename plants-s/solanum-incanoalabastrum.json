    "intro": "Solanum incanoalabastrum, commonly known as the white-hairy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark purple or black color, containing several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for human consumption and is often found in wild, undisturbed habitats."
