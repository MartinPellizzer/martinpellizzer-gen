    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and typically have five to seven leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland edges. The berries are edible but should be prepared properly due to the presence of toxic compounds."
