    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. integrifolia, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in cymes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
