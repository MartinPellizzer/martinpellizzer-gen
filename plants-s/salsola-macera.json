It is characterized by its spiny, sprawling growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain water in arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in some regions. Salsola macera is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy conditions and is part of the Amaranthaceae family."
