    "intro": "Saussurea andoana, commonly known as the Andean saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea andoana plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various small organisms."
