    "intro": "Salix padophylla, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in mountainous areas. Salix padophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments."
