    "intro": "Sesamum integribracteatum, commonly known as the African sesame, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its erect stem and alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in groups of three, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it distinct from other sesame species, particularly in its bract structure and growth habit. It is primarily cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines and for industrial purposes."
