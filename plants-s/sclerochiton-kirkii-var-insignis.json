It is a shrub characterized by its succulent stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in arid regions."
