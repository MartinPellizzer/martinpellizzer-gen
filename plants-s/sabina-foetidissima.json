    "intro": "Sabina foetidissima, commonly known as the stinkwood or western red cedar, is a member of the Cupressaceae family. It is a deciduous conifer that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and dense, scaly bark. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in crossed pairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous cones. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor."
