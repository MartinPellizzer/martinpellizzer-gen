    "intro": "Stellaria divnogorskajae, commonly known as the Divnogorskaya starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and delicate, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
