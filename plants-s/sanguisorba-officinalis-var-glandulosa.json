    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in glandular hairs, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
