    "intro": "Salix crenata, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its drooping branches that hang in cascading streams of foliage, giving it a distinctive, graceful appearance. The leaves are narrow, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, while the catkins are a notable feature of its reproductive structures. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
