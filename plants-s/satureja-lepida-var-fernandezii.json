It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
