It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Styrax ovalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
