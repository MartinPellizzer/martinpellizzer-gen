    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. capensis, commonly known as the Cape rock moss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to South Africa. It is characterized by its creeping, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are concealed beneath the foliage, making it less conspicuous. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
