    "intro": "Saxifraga insolens, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga insolens is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of resilience in extreme climates."
