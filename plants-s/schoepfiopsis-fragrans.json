    "intro": "Schoepfiopsis fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its aromatic foliage emits a pleasant fragrance, especially during warm weather. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
