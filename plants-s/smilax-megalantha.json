    "intro": "Smilax megalantha, commonly known as the giant yellow smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries. These berries are edible for some animals but are generally considered toxic to humans. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
