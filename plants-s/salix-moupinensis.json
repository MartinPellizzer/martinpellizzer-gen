    "intro": "Salix moupinensis, commonly known as the Yunnan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and has small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
