    "intro": "Schleidenia salicoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false willow, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats and sorrels. The plant is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Schleidenia salicoides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
