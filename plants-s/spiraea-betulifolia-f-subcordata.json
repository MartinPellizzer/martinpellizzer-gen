    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia f. subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate willow-leaf spirea, is a compact shrub native to the western United States. It features small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a slightly rounded base. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on arching stems. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and modest floral display, though it is less showy than other spiraea species."
