    "intro": "Salix lavanduloides, commonly known as the lavender willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are the male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability to poor soils make it a notable species in its native habitat. Salix lavanduloides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ornamental value."
