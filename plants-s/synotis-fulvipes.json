    "intro": "Synotis fulvipes, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to brown flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Synotis fulvipes typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
