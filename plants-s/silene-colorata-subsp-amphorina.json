    "intro": "Silene colorata subsp. amphorina, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its showy, pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often prostrate or semi-upright. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
