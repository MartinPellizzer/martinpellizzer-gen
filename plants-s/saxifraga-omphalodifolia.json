    "intro": "Saxifraga omphalodifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky and gravelly habitats, often found in mountainous areas where the climate is cold and the soil is poor. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga omphalodifolia is well adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
