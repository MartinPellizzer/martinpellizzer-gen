    "intro": "Silene nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Silene nevadensis has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It is an important species for local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its alpine environment."
