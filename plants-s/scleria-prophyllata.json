    "intro": "Scleria prophyllata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bulbous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clustered, bulbous base and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Scleria prophyllata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
