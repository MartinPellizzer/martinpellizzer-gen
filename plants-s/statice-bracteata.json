    "intro": "Statice bracteata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-gray in color, adding to its ornamental appeal. Statice bracteata is often used in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
