    "intro": "Sclerolaena divaricata, commonly known as the variable sandbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with well-drained conditions. Sclerolaena divaricata is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
