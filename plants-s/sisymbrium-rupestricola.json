    "intro": "Sisymbrium rupestricola, commonly known as the rock mustard, is a small flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and medicinal plants. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as slopes and gravelly soils. It produces small yellow flowers in early spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils."
