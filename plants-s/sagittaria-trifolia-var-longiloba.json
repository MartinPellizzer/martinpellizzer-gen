    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia var. longiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and floating, with a distinctive V-shaped base. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that rise above the water surface, typically in late summer. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds."
