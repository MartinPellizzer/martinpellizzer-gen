    "intro": "Stylosanthes hispida, commonly known as hairy stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical pods containing small, oval seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value. Stylosanthes hispida also has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
