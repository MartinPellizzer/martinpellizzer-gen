    "intro": "Sisyrinchium rosengurttii, commonly known as the Rosengurtt's blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
