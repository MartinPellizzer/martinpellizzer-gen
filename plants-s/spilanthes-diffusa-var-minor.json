    "intro": "Spilanthes diffusa var. minor, commonly known as toothache plant or stinging hawthorn, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of glandular hairs on the leaves and stems, which can cause a tingling or stinging sensation when touched. The plant is also known for its use in traditional medicine due to its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
