It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces pendulous clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens. Its unique foliage and delicate flowers make it a valuable addition to the botanical diversity of temperate landscapes."
