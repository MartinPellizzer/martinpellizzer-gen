    "intro": "Stylidium lithophilum, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a unique flowering plant native to Australia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant has a slender, twining stem that lacks true leaves, relying instead on its yellowish flowers for reproduction. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
