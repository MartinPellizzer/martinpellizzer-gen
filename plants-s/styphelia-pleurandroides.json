    "intro": "Styphelia pleurandroides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia pleurandroides is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, contributing to the biodiversity of these unique ecosystems."
