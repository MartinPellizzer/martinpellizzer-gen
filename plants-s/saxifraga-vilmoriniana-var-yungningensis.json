    "intro": "Saxifraga vilmoriniana var. yungningensis, commonly known as the Yungning saxifrage, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
