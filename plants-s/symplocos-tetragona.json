    "intro": "Symplocos tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled elder or Indian elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often four-angled in cross-section, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the autumn. These berries are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Symplocos tetragona is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
