    "intro": "Sorghum melaleucum, commonly known as white sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, feathery panicles that produce small white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Sorghum melaleucum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
