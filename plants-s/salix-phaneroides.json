It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are lance-shaped, smooth, and often have a reddish tinge when new. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
