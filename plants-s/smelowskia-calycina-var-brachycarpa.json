    "intro": "Smelowskia calycina var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited smelowskia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its short, fleshy fruits are adapted for dispersal by animals, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
