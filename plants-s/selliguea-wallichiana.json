    "intro": "Selliguea wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan moss, is a species of liverwort found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, leafy structure with a dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its small, closely packed leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, and it produces spore capsules that are borne on short stalks. Selliguea wallichiana plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
