    "intro": "Saglorithys distorta, commonly known as the twisted leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Saglorithys distorta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
