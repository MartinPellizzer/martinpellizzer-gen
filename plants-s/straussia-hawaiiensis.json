    "intro": "Straussia hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian straussia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within montane forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. It has small, elliptical leaves and produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Straussia hawaiiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
