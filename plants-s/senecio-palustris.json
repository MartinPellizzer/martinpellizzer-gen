    "intro": "Senecio palustris, commonly known as swamp ragwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. Senecio palustris plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
