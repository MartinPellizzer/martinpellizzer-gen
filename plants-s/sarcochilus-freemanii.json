    "intro": "Sarcochilus freemanii, commonly known as the Freeman\u2019s ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the eastern rainforests of Australia. It features a unique, fleshy rhizome and produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive white and green coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically open during the cooler months, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Sarcochilus freemanii is classified as vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
