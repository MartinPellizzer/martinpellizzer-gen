    "intro": "Sesleria capitata, commonly known as the clustered sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance. Sesleria capitata is also known for its ability to form dense mats, making it useful for erosion control in suitable environments."
