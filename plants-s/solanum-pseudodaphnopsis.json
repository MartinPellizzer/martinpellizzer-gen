    "intro": "Solanum pseudodaphnopsis, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it produces berries that range in color from yellow to red. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
