    "intro": "Spiraea mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that bear clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Spiraea mongolica is often found in rocky slopes and forest edges, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
