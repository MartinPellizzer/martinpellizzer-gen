    "intro": "Sagittaria latifolia, commonly known as arrowhead, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It has distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Sagittaria latifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
