    "intro": "Scleria olyroides, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
