It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. Its botanical structure includes areoles, which are small, raised structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in desert ecosystems."
