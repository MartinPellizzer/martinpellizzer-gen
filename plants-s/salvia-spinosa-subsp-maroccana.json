    "intro": "Salvia spinosa subsp. maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
