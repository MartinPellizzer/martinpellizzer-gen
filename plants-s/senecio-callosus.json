    "intro": "Senecio callosus, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
