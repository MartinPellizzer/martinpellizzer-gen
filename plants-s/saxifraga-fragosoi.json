    "intro": "Saxifraga fragosoi, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a perennial herb with rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
