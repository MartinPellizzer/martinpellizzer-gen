    "intro": "Scaphyglottis loretorensis, commonly known as the Loretto orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colorful flowers. The plant typically produces showy, spurred orchid blooms with a unique morphology adapted to its specific ecological niche. Its leaves are usually broad and succulent, aiding in water retention in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scaphyglottis loretorensis is considered a vulnerable species."
