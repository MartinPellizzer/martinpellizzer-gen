    "intro": "Sesamum triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf sesame, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Sesamum triphyllum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it distinct from other sesame species, which typically have different leaf structures."
