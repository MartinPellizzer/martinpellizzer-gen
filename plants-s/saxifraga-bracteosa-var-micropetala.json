    "intro": "Saxifraga bracteosa var. micropetala, commonly known as the small-petioled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops where it forms a mat-like growth. This variety is notable for its compact form and delicate floral display, making it a sought-after plant for rock gardens and alpine collections."
