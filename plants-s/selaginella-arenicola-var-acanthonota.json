    "intro": "Selaginella arenicola var. acanthonota, commonly known as the desert spiky moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species adapted to arid environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with spiky, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
