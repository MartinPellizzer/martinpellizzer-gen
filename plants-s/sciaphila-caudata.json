    "intro": "Sciaphila caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives in shaded, humid environments. It primarily grows on the branches of tropical trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its elliptical, leathery leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its slender stems. Sciaphila caudata plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds while also influencing the health of its host trees."
