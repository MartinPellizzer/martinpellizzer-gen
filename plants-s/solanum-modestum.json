    "intro": "Solanum modestum, commonly known as the modest nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Solanum modestum is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
