    "intro": "Sarcochilus vriesii, commonly known as the Vries's ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green and white flowers that resemble skeletal structures. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant blooms during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
