    "intro": "Sidalcea malviflora subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and showy, pink to purple flowers. The subspecies nana is distinguished by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Sidalcea malviflora. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
