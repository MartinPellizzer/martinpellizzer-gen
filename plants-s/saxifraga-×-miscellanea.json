    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 miscellanea, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Saxifraga \u00d7 miscellanea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
