    "intro": "Scaevola spinescens, commonly known as the coastal daisy or spiny scaevola, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal and sandy habitats. Scaevola spinescens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
