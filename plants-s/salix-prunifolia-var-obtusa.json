    "intro": "Salix prunifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
