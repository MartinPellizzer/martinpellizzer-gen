    "intro": "Salicornia dolichostachya subsp. strictissima, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
