    "intro": "Spatularia newcombei, commonly known as the Newcomb's spatula lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leaf-like thallus with a broad, spatula-shaped lobes. It typically grows on bark, wood, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth, leathery texture. It reproduces through the release of soredia, which are small, powdery structures containing both algae and fungal cells. This lichen is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
