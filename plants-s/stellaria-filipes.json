    "intro": "Stellaria filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a delicate, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Stellaria filipes thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
