    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-variegated elderberry, is a cultivar of the elderberry plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring white and green patterns on its leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. The berries are edible but should be cooked before consumption due to the presence of toxic compounds in raw form."
