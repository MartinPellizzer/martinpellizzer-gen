    "intro": "Sporobolus aeneus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf sanddrop, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are adapted to disperse seeds by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration and erosion control in disturbed landscapes."
