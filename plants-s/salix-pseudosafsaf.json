    "intro": "Salix pseudosafsaf, commonly known as the false weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to certain regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that give it a weeping appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
