    "intro": "Symplocos prunifolia var. tawadae, commonly known as the Tawadae waxleaf, is a variant of the waxleaf symplocos, native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain bird species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use in temperate climates. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and coloration compared to the typical form of Symplocos prunifolia."
