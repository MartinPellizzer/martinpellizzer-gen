    "intro": "Spermacoce intricata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous elliptical seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
