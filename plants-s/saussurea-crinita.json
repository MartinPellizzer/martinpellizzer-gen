    "intro": "Saussurea crinita, commonly known as the white hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Russia, and Mongolia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, white plumes that resemble hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Saussurea crinita thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a distinctive component of its native flora."
