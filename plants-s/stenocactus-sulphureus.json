    "intro": "Stenocactus sulphureus, commonly known as the sulphur cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a yellowish or orange tint. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
