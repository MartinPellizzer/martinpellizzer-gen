    "intro": "Saxifraga fastigiata, commonly known as the upright saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
