    "intro": "Smyrnium idaeum, commonly known as the Idaean cowbane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its fruits are dry, three-angled berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Smyrnium idaeum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
