    "intro": "Sphingium spicatum, commonly known as the spiny spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability, showcasing features typical of xerophytic plants. Sphingium spicatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small insects and animals."
