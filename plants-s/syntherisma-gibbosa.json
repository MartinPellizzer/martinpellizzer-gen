    "intro": "Syntherisma gibbosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which are used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pink, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. Syntherisma gibbosa is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
