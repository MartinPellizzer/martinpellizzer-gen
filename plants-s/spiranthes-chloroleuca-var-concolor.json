    "intro": "Spiranthes chloroleuca var. concolor, commonly known as the green-flowered ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its spiraled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and its slender, arching stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. This variety is distinguished by its uniform green flowers, which set it apart from other similar species in the genus."
