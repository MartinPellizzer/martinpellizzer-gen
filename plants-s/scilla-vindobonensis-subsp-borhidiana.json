    "intro": "Scilla vindobonensis subsp. borhidiana, commonly known as the Borhidian squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to calcareous soils and thrives in moist, well-drained environments. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
