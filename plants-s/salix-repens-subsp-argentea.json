    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. argentea, commonly known as silver willow, is a variant of the common willow that exhibits distinct silver-gray foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, flexible stems with lance-shaped leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its characteristic appearance. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
