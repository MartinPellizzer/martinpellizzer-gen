    "intro": "Salvia variabilis, commonly known as tall blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia variabilis is also valued for its aromatic leaves and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
