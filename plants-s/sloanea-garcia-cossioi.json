    "intro": "Sloanea garcia-cossioi, commonly known as the Cauca sloanea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphobiaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of the Cauca Valley in Colombia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered yellowish-white flowers. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, typical of many plants in the Euphobiaceae family. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
