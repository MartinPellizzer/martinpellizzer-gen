    "intro": "Salix amygdalina f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white willow, is a botanical variant of the white willow species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. This plant is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found near water bodies such as streams and rivers. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The bark of this willow is smooth and pale, often exuding a milky sap when damaged."
