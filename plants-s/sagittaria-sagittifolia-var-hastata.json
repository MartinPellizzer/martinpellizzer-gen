    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. hastata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with the leaves emerging from the water surface in a distinctive arrowhead form. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in aquatic habitats."
