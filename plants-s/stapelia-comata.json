    "intro": "Stapelia comata, commonly known as the hairy stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are small and often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. Stapelia comata is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
