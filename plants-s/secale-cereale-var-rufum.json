    "intro": "Secale cereale var. rufum, commonly known as red rye, is a variant of rye that is characterized by its distinctive reddish hues in its leaves and grains. This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 60\u2013100 cm and produces dense clusters of spikelets. The red coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which may offer some resistance to environmental stress. It is often used in agricultural settings for its hardy nature and adaptability to various soil conditions."
