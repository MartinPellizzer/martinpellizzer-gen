It has elongated, narrow leaves and produces panicles of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant is characterized by its robust rhizomes and fibrous roots, which help it thrive in moist, tropical environments. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
