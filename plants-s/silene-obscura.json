    "intro": "Silene obscura, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene obscura is considered a rare and endangered species."
