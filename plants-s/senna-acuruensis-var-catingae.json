    "intro": "Senna acuruensis var. catingae, commonly known as the Catinga senna, is a flowering plant native to the semi-arid regions of Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of many small leaflets. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. The seeds are encased in pods and can remain viable for several years, contributing to its ecological resilience."
