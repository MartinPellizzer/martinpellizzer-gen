    "intro": "Sorbus neuillyensis, commonly known as the Neuilly whitebeams, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the Alps and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by birds. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
