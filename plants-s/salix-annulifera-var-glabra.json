    "intro": "Salix annulifera var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and slender, weeping branches that often droop toward the ground. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways or in wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
