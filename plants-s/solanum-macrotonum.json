    "intro": "Solanum macrotonum, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves and showy violet flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats or along riverbanks. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
