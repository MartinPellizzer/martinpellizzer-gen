It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Sesuvium rubriflorum is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, which enhances its adaptability to harsh environments."
