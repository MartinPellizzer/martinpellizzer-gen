    "intro": "Solanum cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and smooth, oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, round berries that are edible but have a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids. Solanum cheesemanii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
