    "intro": "Syrmatium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly syrmatium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Syrmatium tomentosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
