It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its hairy texture, as suggested by the subspecies name, gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
