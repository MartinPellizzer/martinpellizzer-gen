    "intro": "Secale strictum subsp. chaldicum, commonly known as the narrowleaf ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
