    "intro": "Senecio reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive reflexed (bent backward) tip. Senecio reflexus is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
