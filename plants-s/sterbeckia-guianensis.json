    "intro": "Sterbeckia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan Sterbeckia, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in Guyana and Suriname. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are surrounded by pale green bracts, making it visually distinct in its natural habitat. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
