    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf whitebeam, is a subspecies of the whitebeam tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are less lobed compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
