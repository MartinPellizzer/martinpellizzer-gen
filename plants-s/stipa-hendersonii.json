    "intro": "Stipa hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
