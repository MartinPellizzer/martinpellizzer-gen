    "intro": "Stellaria leiosperma, commonly known as the silky starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often covered with a similar fine pubescence. Stellaria leiosperma typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
