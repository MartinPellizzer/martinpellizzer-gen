    "intro": "Selaginella tuberosa, commonly known as the mountain spikerush, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on specialized strobila structures, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Selaginella tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
