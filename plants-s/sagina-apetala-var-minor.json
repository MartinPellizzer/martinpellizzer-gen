    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. minor, commonly known as lesser common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves and tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. It has a compact growth habit with stems that lie close to the ground, and its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
