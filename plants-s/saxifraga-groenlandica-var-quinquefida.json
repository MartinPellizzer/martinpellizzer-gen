It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical structure reflects its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
