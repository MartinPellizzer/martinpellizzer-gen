    "intro": "Saccharum europaeum, commonly known as European sugar cane. This plant is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe, characterized by its long, slender leaves and robust stalks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is known for its high sugar content in its stalks, making it a valuable resource for historical sugar production. However, it is not as widely cultivated today as its tropical relatives."
