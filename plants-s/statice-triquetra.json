    "intro": "Statice triquetra, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Statice triquetra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in dried flower arrangements."
