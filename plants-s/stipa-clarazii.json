    "intro": "Stipa clarazii, commonly known as the Clarazii needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Stipa clarazii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
