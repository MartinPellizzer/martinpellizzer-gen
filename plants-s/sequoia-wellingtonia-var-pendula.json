    "intro": "Sequoia wellingtonia var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping sequoia, is a striking variant of the giant sequoia. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that create a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. This cultivar is a hybrid of the coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and the giant sequoia (Sequoia gigantea). It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush, weeping appearance. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks where its unique form can be appreciated."
