    "intro": "Saxifraga aristulata var. earistulata, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
