    "intro": "Salix rigida f. mollis, commonly known as the velvet willow, is a shrub characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. This variety is a form of the common willow, Salix rigida, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, contributing to its ecological value by providing early nectar for pollinators."
