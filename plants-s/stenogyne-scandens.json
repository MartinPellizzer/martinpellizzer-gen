It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its twining growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows along forest edges and in disturbed areas, often climbing over other vegetation.

The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens, making it an attractive plant for pollinators."
