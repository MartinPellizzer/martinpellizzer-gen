    "intro": "Siebera juncea var. ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy siebera, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments where it thrives. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
