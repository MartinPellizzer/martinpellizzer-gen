    "intro": "Scilla drunensis, commonly known as the Drunian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It produces striking blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are fleshy and store water, aiding survival in arid conditions. Scilla drunensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained gardens."
