    "intro": "Sabulina glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Sabulina glandulosa is often found in coastal dunes, desert plains, and other harsh, well-drained habitats."
