    "intro": "Sclerothamnus, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Sclerothamnus species are characterized by their succulent, spine-tipped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. The genus includes several species, such as Sclerothamnus torreyi and Sclerothamnus wrightii, which are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
