    "intro": "Solanum gomphodes, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The fruit is a fleshy berry that ripens to a deep red color, containing several seeds."
