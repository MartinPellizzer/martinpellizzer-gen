    "intro": "Spiraea trifoliata, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring arching branches covered in clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning each leaflet is three-lobed, and they are arranged oppositely along the stems. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
