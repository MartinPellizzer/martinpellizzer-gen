    "intro": "Salix helix var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that are often used for wickerwork and basket making. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by red or purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways and in wetlands."
