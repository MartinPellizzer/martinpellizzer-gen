    "intro": "Scorzonella sylvatica var. stillmanii, commonly known as Stillman's scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, which contributes to its ecological resilience. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
