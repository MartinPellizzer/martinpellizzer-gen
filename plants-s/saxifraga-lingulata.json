    "intro": "Saxifraga lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Saxifraga lingulata is well adapted to cold climates and is a hardy perennial that can survive extreme temperature fluctuations."
