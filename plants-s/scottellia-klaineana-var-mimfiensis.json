    "intro": "Scottellia klaineana var. mimfiensis, commonly known as the Mimfin scottellia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy scent, while its small white flowers bloom in clusters during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
