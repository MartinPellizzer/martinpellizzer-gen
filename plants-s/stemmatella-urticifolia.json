    "intro": "Stemmatella urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, quadrangular stems and serrated leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in woodland edges. Its leaves and stems are widely used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
