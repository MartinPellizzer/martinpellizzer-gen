    "intro": "Salix persicifolia, commonly known as the peach-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix persicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its delicate, willow-like appearance."
