    "intro": "Solanum brieyi, commonly known as the Brieey's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, which are characteristic of the Solanaceae family. Solanum brieyi is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
