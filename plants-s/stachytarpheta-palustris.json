    "intro": "Stachytarpheta palustris, commonly known as swamp verbena, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. This plant is adapted to moist or wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
