    "intro": "Schinus huigan var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Huichol thornapple, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and often have a distinct, serrated appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. The variability in leaf shape, as indicated by the varietal name *heterophylla*, is a notable botanical feature of this species."
