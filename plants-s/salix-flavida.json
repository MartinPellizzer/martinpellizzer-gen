    "intro": "Salix flavida, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix flavida thrives in moist, often riparian habitats and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful plant for erosion control and landscape restoration."
