    "intro": "Sagittaria latifolia f. hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with narrow, grass-like leaves submerged beneath the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spikes above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
