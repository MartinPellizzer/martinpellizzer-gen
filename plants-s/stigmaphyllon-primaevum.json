    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon primaevum, commonly known as the ancient leaf plant, is a rare species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
