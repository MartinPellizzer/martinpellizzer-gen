It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct longitudinal channels. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and lake margins, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its subspecific name reflects the unique features of its leaf structure and stem shape."
