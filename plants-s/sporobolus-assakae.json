    "intro": "Sporobolus assakae, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of three to five spikelets per branch. Sporobolus assakae is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
