    "intro": "Solanum litoraneum, commonly known as sea eggplant or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand salty and arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, green berries that turn red when mature. Its fruits are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their raw form. Solanum litoraneum is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
