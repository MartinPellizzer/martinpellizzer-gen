    "intro": "Serratula polyclonos, commonly known as the clustered goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are serrated and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Serratula polyclonos is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
