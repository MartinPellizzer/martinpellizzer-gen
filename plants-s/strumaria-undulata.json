It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate, with wavy margins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine meadows. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
