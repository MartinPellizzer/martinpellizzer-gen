    "intro": "Salix purpurea f. sericea, commonly known as the silky willow, is a horticultural form of the purple willow. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Its catkins and heart-shaped leaves make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a graceful, early spring-flowering shrub."
