    "intro": "Scleropoa racemosa, commonly known as the flowering grass or racemose grass, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in poor soil conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Scleropoa racemosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
