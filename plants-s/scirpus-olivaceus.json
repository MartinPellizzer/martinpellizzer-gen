    "intro": "Scirpus olivaceus, commonly known as the green bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Scirpus olivaceus thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
