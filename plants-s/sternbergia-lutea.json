    "intro": "Sternbergia lutea, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are often mistaken for true crocuses. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulb and are covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers consist of three sepals that resemble petals and three true petals, with a distinctive, curved shape. Sternbergia lutea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade."
