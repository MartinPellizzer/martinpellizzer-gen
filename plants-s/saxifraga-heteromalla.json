    "intro": "Saxifraga heteromalla, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink or white flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Saxifraga heteromalla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
