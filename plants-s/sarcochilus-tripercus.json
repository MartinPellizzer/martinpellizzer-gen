    "intro": "Sarcochilus tripercus, commonly known as the three-lobed hothouse, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. This species is well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid environments with partial shade."
