    "intro": "Solanum nigrum f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf black nightshade, is a variant of the black nightshade plant. It is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from the typical Solanum nigrum, with its reduced leaf size and unique growth habits."
