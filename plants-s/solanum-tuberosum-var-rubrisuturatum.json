    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. rubrisuturatum, commonly known as the red-striped potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato characterized by its distinctive red veins running through the flesh. This variety is notable for its unique coloration, which sets it apart from typical white or yellow-fleshed potatoes. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same genus as other tuberous species. It is cultivated for both its ornamental value and its edible tubers, which have a slightly different flavor profile compared to standard potatoes. The red streaks in the flesh are due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its potential health benefits."
