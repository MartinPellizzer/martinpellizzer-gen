    "intro": "Stenophyllus capillaris subsp. trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed stenophyllus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, with three distinct lobes on each petal, giving it its subspecific name. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
