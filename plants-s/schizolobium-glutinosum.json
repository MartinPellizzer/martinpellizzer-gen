    "intro": "Schizolobium glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky acacia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is notable for its sticky resin, which exudes from the bark and leaves, giving it its common name. Schizolobium glutinosum is often found in dry to moist forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. It also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
