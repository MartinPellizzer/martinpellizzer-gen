    "intro": "Salix divaricata var. orthostemma, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in forested areas. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
