    "intro": "Setaria pennisetum, commonly known as finger grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender spikes that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Setaria pennisetum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
