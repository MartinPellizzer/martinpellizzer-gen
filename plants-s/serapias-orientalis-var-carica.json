    "intro": "Serapias orientalis var. carica, commonly known as the Carpathian sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Capparaceae), and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
