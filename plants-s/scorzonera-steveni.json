    "intro": "Scorzonera steveni, commonly known as Steven's scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Scorzonera steveni is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
