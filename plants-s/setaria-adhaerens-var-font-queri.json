    "intro": "Setaria adhaerens var. font-queri, commonly known as Font-Qu\u00e9ri's bluestem, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually bluish-green, and the plant is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
