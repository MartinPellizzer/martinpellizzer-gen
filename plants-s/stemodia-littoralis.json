    "intro": "Stemodia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal stemodia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in saline and windy environments. Stemodia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
