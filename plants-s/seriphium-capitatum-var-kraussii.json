    "intro": "Seriphium capitatum var. kraussii, commonly known as the Krauss's hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces a single, large, yellow composite flower head that is surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
