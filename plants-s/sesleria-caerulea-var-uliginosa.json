    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue to purple flower spikes during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to water garden landscapes. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
