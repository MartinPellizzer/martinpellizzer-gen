It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Yellowrocket is also noted for its historical use in dyeing fabrics due to the presence of flavonoids in its flowers."
