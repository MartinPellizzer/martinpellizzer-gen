    "intro": "Salix eriostachya var. argyrotrichocarpa, commonly known as the silver-haired willow, is a variant of the willow species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow catkins. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its ornamental value comes from its silvery-white undersides and graceful growth habit."
