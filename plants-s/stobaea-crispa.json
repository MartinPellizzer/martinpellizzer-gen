    "intro": "Stobaea crispa, commonly known as the crinkled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, crinkled leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental foliage and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
