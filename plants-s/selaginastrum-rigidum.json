    "intro": "Selaginastrum rigidum, commonly known as rigid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant has rigid, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically blue or purple and bloom during the cooler months, attracting various pollinators. Selaginastrum rigidum is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
