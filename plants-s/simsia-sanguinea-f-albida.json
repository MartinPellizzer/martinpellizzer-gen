    "intro": "Simsia sanguinea f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered bloodroot, is a rare variant of the bloodroot species. It is characterized by its striking white petals, which contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Botanically, it is noted for its unique floral structure and limited genetic diversity, making it a subject of interest in conservation studies."
