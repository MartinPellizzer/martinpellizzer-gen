It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spiny, woody fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in lowland and hill forests, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique relationship with ants, it plays a significant role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
