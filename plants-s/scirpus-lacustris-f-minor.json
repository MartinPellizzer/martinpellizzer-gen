    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris f. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. This plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. The narrowleaf bulrush plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
