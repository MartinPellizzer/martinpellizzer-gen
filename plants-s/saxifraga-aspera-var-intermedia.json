    "intro": "Saxifraga aspera var. intermedia, commonly known as the rough saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are rough to the touch, with serrated edges, and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in crevices, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga aspera var. intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
