    "intro": "Sempervivum affine, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountains of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around its base, which can be separated and grown independently. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, including cold and arid environments."
