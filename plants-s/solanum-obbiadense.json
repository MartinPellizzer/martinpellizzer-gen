    "intro": "Solanum obbiadense, commonly known as the Obbiadense nightshade, is a species native to specific regions in Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are usually ovate with a rough texture, and it is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided for agricultural use but studied for its potential medicinal properties."
