It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery, dark green leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. Styphelia strongylophylla is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
