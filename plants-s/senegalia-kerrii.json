    "intro": "Senegalia kerrii, commonly known as the kerri acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow or brown globular flowers. The plant produces long, thin pods that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Senegalia kerrii is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
