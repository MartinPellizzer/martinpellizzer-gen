It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. The plant features fleshy, linear leaves that are often blue-green in color, which help it store water efficiently. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in the summer months. This variety is prized for its drought tolerance and ornamental value in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
