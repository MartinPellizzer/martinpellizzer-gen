    "intro": "Stylurus banksii f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered stylurus, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, and its most notable trait is the production of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Stylurus banksii f. albiflora is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
