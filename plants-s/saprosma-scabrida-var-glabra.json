    "intro": "Saprosma scabrida var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth saprosma, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to moderate drought make it a resilient species in its native habitat. The smooth saprosma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
