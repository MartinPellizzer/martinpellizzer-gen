    "intro": "Senecio vulgaris, commonly known as common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. Senecio vulgaris is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
