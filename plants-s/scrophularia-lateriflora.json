    "intro": "Scrophularia lateriflora, commonly known as the side-flowered figwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and butterflies. Scrophularia lateriflora is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in certain regions."
