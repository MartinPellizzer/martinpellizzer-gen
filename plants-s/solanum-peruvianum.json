    "intro": "Solanum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. Solanum peruvianum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It contains toxic alkaloids and is not typically used for culinary purposes."
