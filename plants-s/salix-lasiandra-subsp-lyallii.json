    "intro": "Salix lasiandra subsp. lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's willow, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for native wildlife."
