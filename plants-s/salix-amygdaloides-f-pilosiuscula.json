    "intro": "Salix amygdaloides f. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the woolly almond willow, is a variant of the almond willow characterized by its dense, silky white hairs covering the stems and leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a finely toothed margin, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. The woolly covering provides protection against harsh environmental conditions, making it well adapted to its native habitat."
