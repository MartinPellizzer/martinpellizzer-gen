It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
