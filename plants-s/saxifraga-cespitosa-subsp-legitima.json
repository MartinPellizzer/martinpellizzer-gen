    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. legitima, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. legitima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
