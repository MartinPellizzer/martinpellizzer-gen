    "intro": "Stereosandra javanica, commonly known as the Javan sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in its native habitat."
