    "intro": "Serpyllopsis caespitosa var. typica, commonly known as the tufted serpyllopsis, is a perennial herb native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a compact, clump-forming growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are arranged in dense clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous root system, which helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats."
