    "intro": "Scirpus uniglumis var. salinus, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland species."
