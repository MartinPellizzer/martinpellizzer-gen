    "intro": "Selaginella njamnjamensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert spiky clubmoss, is a unique plant species native to the arid regions of Namibia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant exhibits remarkable adaptations to its harsh environment, including a thick cuticle to reduce water loss and the ability to survive extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other desert organisms. Its conservation is important due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disruption."
