    "intro": "Sigesbeckia iberica, commonly known as the Iberian sigesbeckia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Sigesbeckia iberica is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean vegetation."
