    "intro": "Saxifraga sileneflora var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
