It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong, minty fragrance. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
