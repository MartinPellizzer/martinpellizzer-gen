    "intro": "Senecio peraltae, commonly known as Palafox's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio peraltae produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer."
