    "intro": "Stellaria subulata, commonly known as slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow, pointed, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and the growing season is short. Stellaria subulata plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme habitats and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
