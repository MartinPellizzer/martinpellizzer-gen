    "intro": "Schoenoplectus pungens var. pungens, commonly known as the spiny bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct spiny texture along the edges, contributing to its common name. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
