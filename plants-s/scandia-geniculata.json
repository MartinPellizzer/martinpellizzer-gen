    "intro": "Scandia geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Scandia geniculata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
