    "intro": "Salacia smaliana, commonly known as the red-flowered salacia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus *Salacia*. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Salacia smaliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
