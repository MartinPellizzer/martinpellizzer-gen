    "intro": "Sicana trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a woody stem that becomes more prominent as it matures. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it ripens."
