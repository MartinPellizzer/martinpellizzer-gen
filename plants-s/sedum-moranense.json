    "intro": "Sedum moranense, commonly known as Moran's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
