    "intro": "Saussurea mikurasimensis, commonly known as the Mikura Island saussurea, is a flowering plant native to Japan, specifically the island of Mikura. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, reflecting its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow to brown in color, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
