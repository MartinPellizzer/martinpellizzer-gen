    "intro": "Swertia albicaulis f. alba, commonly known as the white swertia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
