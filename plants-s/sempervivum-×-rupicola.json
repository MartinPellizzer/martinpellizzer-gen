    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 rupicola, commonly known as the stonecrop hybrid, is a succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
