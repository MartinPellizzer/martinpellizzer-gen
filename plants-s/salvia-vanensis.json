It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Salvia vanensis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
