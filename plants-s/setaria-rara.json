    "intro": "Setaria rara, commonly known as the rare beardgrass, is a diminutive annual grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, erect stems covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its limited distribution and low population numbers, Setaria rara is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
