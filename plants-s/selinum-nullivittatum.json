It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
