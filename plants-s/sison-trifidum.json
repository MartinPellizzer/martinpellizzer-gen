    "intro": "Sison trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed sison, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving the plant its scientific name. Sison trifidum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
