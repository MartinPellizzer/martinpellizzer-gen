    "intro": "Sphaeralcea sulphurea, commonly known as sulphur mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Sphaeralcea sulphurea plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats."
