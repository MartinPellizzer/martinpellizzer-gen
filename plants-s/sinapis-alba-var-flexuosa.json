    "intro": "Sinapis alba var. flexuosa, commonly known as curled yellow mustard, is a biennial or annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable crop and a potential weed."
