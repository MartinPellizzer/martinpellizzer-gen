    "intro": "Santalodes acuminatum, commonly known as the slender sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, leathery leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
