    "intro": "Selaginella ramosii, commonly known as the common spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, branched structure with small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its stems. Selaginella ramosii reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions. This species is also notable for its resilience and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
