    "intro": "Swartzia madagascariensis f. grandifoliolata, commonly known as the giant-leaved swartzia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its large, palmately lobed leaves, which can reach significant sizes, giving it a striking appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
