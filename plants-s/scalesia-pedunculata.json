    "intro": "Scalesia pedunculata, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos giant daisy, is a striking plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the islands, including high altitudes and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. Scalesia pedunculata plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a symbol of the biodiversity found in the Gal\u00e1pagos."
