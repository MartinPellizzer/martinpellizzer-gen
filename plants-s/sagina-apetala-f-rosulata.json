    "intro": "Sagina apetala f. rosulata, commonly known as the rosette moss or rose moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosettes of small, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or woodland soils. Its unique morphology and ability to retain moisture make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings."
