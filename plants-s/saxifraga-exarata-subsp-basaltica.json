    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subsp. basaltica, commonly known as the basalt saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found on basaltic substrates, giving it its common name. Its botanical features make it well-suited for cold, arid environments and it is often used in rock garden settings."
