    "intro": "Sarcoglottis lithophila, commonly known as the stone orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has fleshy, thick leaves that help it store water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or green, which helps it blend with its rocky surroundings. Sarcoglottis lithophila is adapted to low-nutrient environments, making it a specialized and resilient species."
