    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ambigua var. argentifolia, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid species within the willow family (Salicaceae). It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist environments, thriving in temperate climates. Its catkin-like flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The silver willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects."
