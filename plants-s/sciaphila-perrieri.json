    "intro": "Sciaphila perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's shade plant, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in dense forests where light is limited. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, adapted to maximize light absorption. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
