    "intro": "Stelis loefgrenii, commonly known as the Loefgren's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis loefgrenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific care requirements."
