    "intro": "Stellaria dicranoides, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine or subalpine habitats. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Stellaria dicranoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
