    "intro": "Siderobombyx, commonly known as the iron-winged beetle, is a genus of metallic beetles belonging to the family Buprestidae, known for their striking iridescent colors. These beetles are typically found in forested areas, where they inhabit the bark of trees and logs. Their diet primarily consists of decaying wood, which provides the necessary nutrients for their development. The larvae of Siderobombyx are often found in the heartwood of dead or decaying trees, where they feed on fungal mycelium. The genus plays a role in the decomposition process, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
