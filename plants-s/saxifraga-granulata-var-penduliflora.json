    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, often hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in rocky, alpine environments. Its pendulous inflorescence gives it a distinctive appearance, with flowers hanging downward from the stems. It is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
