    "intro": "Schizaea australis, commonly known as the Australian clubmoss, is a species of fern ally native to Australia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and erect, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations along the stems. Schizaea australis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
