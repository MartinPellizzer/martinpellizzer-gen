    "intro": "Stelis trifoliacea, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces showy, spike-like inflorescences. Stelis trifoliacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
