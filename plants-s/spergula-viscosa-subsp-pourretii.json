    "intro": "Spergula viscosa subsp. pourretii, commonly known as the sticky spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense spikes. The plant is notable for its viscid (sticky) surface, which helps in deterring herbivores and aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils, commonly found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
