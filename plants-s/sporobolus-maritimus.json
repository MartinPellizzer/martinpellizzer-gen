    "intro": "Sporobolus maritimus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Sporobolus maritimus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
