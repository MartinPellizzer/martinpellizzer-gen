    "intro": "Salix pennata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. Salix pennata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its graceful form. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
