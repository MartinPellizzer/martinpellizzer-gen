    "intro": "Spergularia manicata, commonly known as the sand spurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along shorelines. Spergularia manicata is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
