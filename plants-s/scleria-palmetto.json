    "intro": "Scleria palmetto, commonly known as the palmetto sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet or moist environments. Scleria palmetto is often found in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
