    "intro": "Stylidium lessonii, commonly known as the sun orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, sun-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, which is why it is sometimes called the \"sun orchid.\" Stylidium lessonii is also notable for its unique pollination mechanism, where the flower bends to present pollen to pollinators."
