    "intro": "Salix triandra var. discolor, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is typically found in moist, sandy soils near watercourses. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. The varietal form discolor refers to the distinctive coloration of its leaves."
