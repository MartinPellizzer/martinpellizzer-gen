    "intro": "Scleria micrococca, commonly known as the small white flag iris, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of its native ecosystems. Scleria micrococca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
