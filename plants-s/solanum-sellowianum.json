    "intro": "Solanum sellowianum, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height, characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum sellowianum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties."
