    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato with distinctive ornamental features. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that range from white to purple, making it suitable for garden display. The foliage is often more vibrant and textured compared to standard potato varieties, adding visual interest. While it produces tubers, the plant is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than commercial potato yield. Its botanical traits make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
