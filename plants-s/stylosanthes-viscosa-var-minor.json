    "intro": "Stylosanthes viscosa var. minor, commonly known as small sticky stylo, is a low-growing perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has erect or prostrate stems that are often covered with fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by oblong, flattened pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in forage systems due to its drought tolerance. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
