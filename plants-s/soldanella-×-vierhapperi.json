    "intro": "Soldanella \u00d7 vierhapperi, commonly known as the hybrid snowdrop, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Soldanella alpina and Soldanella biflora. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, resembling those of true snowdrops. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
