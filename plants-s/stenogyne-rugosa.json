    "intro": "Stenogyne rugosa, commonly known as the rough stenogyne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Due to habitat loss, Stenogyne rugosa is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
