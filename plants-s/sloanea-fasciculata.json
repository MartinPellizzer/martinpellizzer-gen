    "intro": "Sloanea fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in fascicles, giving it its specific epithet \"fasciculata.\" Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous seeds, and the plant is often found in humid, lowland forests. Sloanea fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
