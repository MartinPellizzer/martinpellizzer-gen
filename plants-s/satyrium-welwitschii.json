It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in semi-arid to arid environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
