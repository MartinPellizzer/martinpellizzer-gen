    "intro": "Sorbus wardii, commonly known as the Ward's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates. Due to its limited distribution, Sorbus wardii is considered a rare and endemic species."
