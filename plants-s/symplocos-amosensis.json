It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understoreys. Its leaves are leathery and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.
