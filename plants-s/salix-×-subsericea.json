    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 subsericea, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal beauty. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds."
