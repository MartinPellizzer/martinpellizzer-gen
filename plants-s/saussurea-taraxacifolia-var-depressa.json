    "intro": "Saussurea taraxacifolia var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarfed saussurea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white composite flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
