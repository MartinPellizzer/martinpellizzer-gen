    "intro": "Sulla capitata, commonly known as the common salsify, is a biennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a single, large capitulum, which consists of many small, tubular florets. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Sulla capitata is known for its edible roots, which have a slightly sweet and nutty flavor when cooked."
