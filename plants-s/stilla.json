    "intro": "Stilla, commonly known as the \"flower of the desert,\" is a rare and resilient plant native to arid regions. It features a compact, bushy structure with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming during brief periods of rainfall. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources. Due to its unique adaptations, Stilla is an important indicator of ecosystem health in desert environments."
