    "intro": "Sedum burnhamii, commonly known as Burnham's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for water-efficient landscaping."
