    "intro": "Setaria verticillata var. respiciens, commonly known as the bearded panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in wetland environments. The plant produces slender, branching stalks with small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
