    "intro": "Sericotheca argentea, commonly known as silver sheath or silver cup, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white, waxy leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The genus Sericotheca is notable for its unique leaf morphology, which contributes to its ecological and ornamental value."
