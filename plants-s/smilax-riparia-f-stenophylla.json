    "intro": "Smilax riparia f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf greenbriar, is a variant of the common greenbriar, characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are armed with sharp, curved spines, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface, contributing to its adaptability in wetland environments."
