It features elongated, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often hanging from trees in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. Stelis longirepens thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
