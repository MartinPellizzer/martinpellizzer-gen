    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 holosericea, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix babylonica (Babylon willow), resulting in a plant with unique morphological traits. The leaves are typically oval, with a bluish-green upper surface and a white, fuzzy underside, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a common ornamental species in gardens and parks. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind."
