    "intro": "Salix gracilis var. textoris, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a fine, silky texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
