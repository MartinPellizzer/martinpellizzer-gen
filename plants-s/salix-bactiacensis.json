It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, greenish-yellow catkins. The plant thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, and it has adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat through deep root systems. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Salix bactiacensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
