    "intro": "Scorzonella sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland scorzonera, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across open, disturbed soils. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of early successional plant communities."
