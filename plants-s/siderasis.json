    "intro": "Siderasis, commonly known as ironweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, sturdy stems and clusters of small, often blue or purple flowers. Siderasis species are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. The name \"siderasis\" is derived from the Greek words for iron and to bind, possibly referring to the plant's hardy nature."
