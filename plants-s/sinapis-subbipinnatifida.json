    "intro": "Sinapis subbipinnatifida, commonly known as the double-pinnate mustard, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its bi- or tri-pinnate leaves, which are deeply divided and give it a feathery appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. The seeds are enclosed in siliques, which are elongated pods that split open when mature to release the seeds."
