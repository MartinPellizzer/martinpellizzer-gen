    "intro": "Syngonanthus hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in moist environments. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Syngonanthus hybridus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
