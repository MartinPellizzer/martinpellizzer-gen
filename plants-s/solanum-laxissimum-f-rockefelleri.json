    "intro": "Solanum laxissimum f. rockefelleri, commonly known as the Rockefeller's hairy nightshade, is a rare and unique variant of the Solanum genus. It is characterized by its densely hairy foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions in Mexico, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually pubescent, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a deep purple. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
