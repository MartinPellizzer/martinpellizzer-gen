    "intro": "Sorghum subtile, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small-statured grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the upper portion of the stem. It is often grown as a forage crop due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies."
