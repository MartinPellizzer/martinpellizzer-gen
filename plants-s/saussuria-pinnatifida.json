It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. Saussuria pinnatifida is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
