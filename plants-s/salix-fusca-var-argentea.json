    "intro": "Salix fusca var. argentea, commonly known as silver willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bark is smooth and gray, while the branches droop in a weeping manner. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and aesthetic appeal."
