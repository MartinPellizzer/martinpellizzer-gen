    "intro": "Serratula, commonly known as the \"serrate leaf\" or \"yellow hawkweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Serratula species typically have finely toothed or serrated leaves, which give the genus its scientific name. They are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. Some species are considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
