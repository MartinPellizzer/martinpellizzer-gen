    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides subsp. moschata, commonly known as the musk saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. The plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecies name, *moschata*, refers to its aromatic scent, which is reminiscent of musk."
