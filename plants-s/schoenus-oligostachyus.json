    "intro": "Schoenus oligostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grasses. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas and along the edges of water bodies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flower spikes during the flowering season. Schoenus oligostachyus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
