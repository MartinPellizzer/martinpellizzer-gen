    "intro": "Stahlianthus involucratus, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a small shrub characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
