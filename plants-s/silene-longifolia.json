    "intro": "Silene longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered catchfly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals that are fused at the base, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Silene longifolia is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
