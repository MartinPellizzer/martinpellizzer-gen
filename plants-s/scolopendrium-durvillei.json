    "intro": "Scolopendrium durvillei, commonly known as the Durville's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores. The plant features scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, typical of the family Lycopodiaceae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
