    "intro": "Spiranthes euglossa, commonly known as the pink spikerock, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense colonies in suitable environments. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in sandy or acidic soils, making it a common sight in coastal and inland regions."
