    "intro": "Solanum flagelliferum, commonly known as the weeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a dark blue or black color, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
