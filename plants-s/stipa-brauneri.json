    "intro": "Stipa brauneri, commonly known as Braun's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in loose, open panicles. Stipa brauneri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, wind-blown foliage."
