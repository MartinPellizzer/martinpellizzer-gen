    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sendaica subsp. ultima, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
