    "intro": "Scorzonera nivalis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces a taproot that is edible and has a nutty, earthy flavor, making it a traditional food in some cultures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Scorzonera nivalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
