    "intro": "Sertula altissima, commonly known as the giant sertula, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery foliage. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Sertula altissima is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
