It is characterized by its large, round leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
