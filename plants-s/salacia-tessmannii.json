    "intro": "Salacia tessmannii, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Salacia tessmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
