    "intro": "Sedum falconis, commonly known as Falcon's sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch out, and its small, star-shaped flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
