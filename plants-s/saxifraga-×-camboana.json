    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 camboana, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga \u00d7 camboana is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
