    "intro": "Soyauxia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature. Soyauxia velutina is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its historical use in traditional medicine."
