    "intro": "Syngonanthus fertilis var. fuscus, commonly known as the dark-leaved fern, is a variant of the fern species Syngonanthus fertilis. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically longer and more robust than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
