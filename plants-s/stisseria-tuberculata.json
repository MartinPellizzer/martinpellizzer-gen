    "intro": "Stisseria tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, triangular stems that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a rough texture, which gives it its common name. Stisseria tuberculata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
