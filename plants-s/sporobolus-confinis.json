    "intro": "Sporobolus confinis, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and awned lemmas, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Sporobolus confinis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
