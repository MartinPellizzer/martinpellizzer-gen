    "intro": "Stipa pachypus, commonly known as the thick-leaved grass or broad-leafed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or bluish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Stipa pachypus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
