It produces clusters of blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate floral display."
