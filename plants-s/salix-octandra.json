    "intro": "Salix octandra, commonly known as the eight-angled willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, multi-branching stems that form a dense, bushy structure. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, cylindrical fruits. This species is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
