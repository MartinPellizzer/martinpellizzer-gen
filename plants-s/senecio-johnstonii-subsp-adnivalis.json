    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii subsp. adnivalis, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of alpine ecosystems."
