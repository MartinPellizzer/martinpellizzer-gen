    "intro": "Schoberia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited schoberia, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Schoberia macrocarpa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
