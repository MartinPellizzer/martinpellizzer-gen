    "intro": "Selenicereus longicaudatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant produces a thick, fleshy fruit that is edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its nocturnal flowering habit is an adaptation to attract pollinators such as bats and moths. The species is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
