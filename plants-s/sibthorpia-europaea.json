    "intro": "Sibthorpia europaea, commonly known as the European sibthorpia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Sibthorpia europaea is often found in open woodlands and along coastal cliffs."
