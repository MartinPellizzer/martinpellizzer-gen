    "intro": "Salvia fruticosa, commonly known as Spanish sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in both gardens and herbal medicine."
