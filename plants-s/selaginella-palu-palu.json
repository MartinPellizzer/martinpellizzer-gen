    "intro": "Selaginella palu-palu, commonly known as the \"kangaroo vine,\" is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its fleshy, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it spread and colonize new areas. Selaginella palu-palu is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
