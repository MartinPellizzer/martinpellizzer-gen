    "intro": "Stilbe mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils. Stilbe mucronata plays a role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for small insects and invertebrates."
