    "intro": "Spiranthes lutzii, commonly known as the Lutz's spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwoods and wetlands, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette near the base of the plant. Spiranthes lutzii is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer, adding a subtle floral presence to its natural habitat."
