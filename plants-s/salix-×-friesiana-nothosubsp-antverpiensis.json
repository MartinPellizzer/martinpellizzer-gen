    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 friesiana nothosubsp. antverpiensis, commonly known as the Antwerp willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the lowland areas of Belgium. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways or in damp woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
