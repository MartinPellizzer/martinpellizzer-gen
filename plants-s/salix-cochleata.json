    "intro": "Salix cochleata, commonly known as the spiral willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of branches, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
