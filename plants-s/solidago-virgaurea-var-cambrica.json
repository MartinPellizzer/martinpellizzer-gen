It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, downy hairs, while its stems are usually erect and somewhat hairy. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife and biodiversity."
