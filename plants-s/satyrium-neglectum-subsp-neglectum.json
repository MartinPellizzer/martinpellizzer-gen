It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
