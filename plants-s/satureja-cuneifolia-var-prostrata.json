    "intro": "Satureja cuneifolia var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate mountain savory, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its aromatic foliage and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative or culinary plant."
