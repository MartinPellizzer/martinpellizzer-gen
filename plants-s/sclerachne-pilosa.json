    "intro": "Sclerachne pilosa, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of hairy structures on its leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Sclerachne pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
