    "intro": "Senegalia hirsuta, commonly known as screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its twisted, often spiral-shaped branches and small, deciduous leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems. Senegalia hirsuta also has historical significance as a food source for both wildlife and humans."
