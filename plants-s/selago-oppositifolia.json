    "intro": "Selago oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved selago, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Selago oppositifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
