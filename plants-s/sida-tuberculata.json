    "intro": "Sida tuberculata, commonly known as rough sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sida tuberculata is often found in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and sandy areas. It is considered a weed in some agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
