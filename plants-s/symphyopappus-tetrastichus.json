    "intro": "Symphyopappus tetrastichus, commonly known as the four-rowed composite, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
