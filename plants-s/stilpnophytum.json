    "intro": "Stilpnophytum, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance with slender, wiry stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plants typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Stilpnophytum species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their fine texture and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. They are also valued for their role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
