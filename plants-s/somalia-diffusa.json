    "intro": "Somalia diffusa, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap, which is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Somalia diffusa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions."
