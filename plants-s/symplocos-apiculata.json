It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
