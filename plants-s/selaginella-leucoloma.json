The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are small, linear, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Selaginella leucoloma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
