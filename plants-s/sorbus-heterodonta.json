    "intro": "Sorbus heterodonta, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
