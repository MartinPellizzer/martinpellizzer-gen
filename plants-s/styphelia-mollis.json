    "intro": "Styphelia mollis, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Styphelia mollis is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal environments."
