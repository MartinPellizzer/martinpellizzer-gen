    "intro": "Salix orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive oval-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Salix orbicularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic species."
