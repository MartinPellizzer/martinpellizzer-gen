    "intro": "Sorghum verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled sorghum, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that forms a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate to warm climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes. Sorghum verticillatum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
