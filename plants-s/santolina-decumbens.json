    "intro": "Santolina decumbens, commonly known as silver thread, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, gray-green foliage that is covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in compact, rounded inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Santolina decumbens is often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative ground cover due to its ornamental value and resilience."
