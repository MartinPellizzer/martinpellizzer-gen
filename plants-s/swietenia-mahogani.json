    "intro": "Swietenia mahogani, commonly known as Honduras mahogany, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has large, compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. Its flowers are small and yellowish, and it produces woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List."
