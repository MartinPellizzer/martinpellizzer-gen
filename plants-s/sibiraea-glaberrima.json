    "intro": "Sibiraea glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth sibiraea, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Sibiraea glaberrima plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various animals."
