    "intro": "Saxifraga bergenioides, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically oval or spatulate, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Saxifraga bergenioides is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
