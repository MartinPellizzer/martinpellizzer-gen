    "intro": "Selaginella jiulongensis, commonly known as the Jiulongshan spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the Jiulongshan region of Yunnan Province. This plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
