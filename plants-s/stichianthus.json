    "intro": "Stichianthus, commonly known as the Hawaiian starflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, and white. The plants are shrubs or small trees with opposite, often lance-shaped leaves. They are adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including nutrient-poor soils and a tropical climate. Stichianthus species are also notable for their role in pollination, attracting various native insects and birds."
