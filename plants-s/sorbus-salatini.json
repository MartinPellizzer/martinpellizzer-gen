    "intro": "Sorbus salatini, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
