    "intro": "Sideroxylon coriaceum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a hardy, evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its wood is exceptionally dense and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture. Sideroxylon coriaceum is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soils, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
