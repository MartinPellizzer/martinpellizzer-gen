    "intro": "Stipa parviflora var. contorta, commonly known as the twisted false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, exhibiting a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
