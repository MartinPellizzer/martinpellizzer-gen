    "intro": "Sporobolus hubbardii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the southwestern and central regions. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness. Sporobolus hubbardii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
