    "intro": "Schraderia hydrangea, commonly known as the snowball hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, rounded clusters of white, sterile flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Schraderia hydrangea is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
