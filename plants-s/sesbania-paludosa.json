It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in areas with high water tables and can tolerate periodic flooding. Sesbania paludosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
