    "intro": "Scepocarpus repens, commonly known as the creeping scecocarp, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across wetland areas. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a glossy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The fruit is a spadix, typical of the Araceae family, which releases tiny seeds when mature."
