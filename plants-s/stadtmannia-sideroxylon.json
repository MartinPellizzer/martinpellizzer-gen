    "intro": "Stadtmannia sideroxylon, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptic or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
