    "intro": "Sagenia lobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive lobed margins, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and blue. Sagenia lobata is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal practices."
