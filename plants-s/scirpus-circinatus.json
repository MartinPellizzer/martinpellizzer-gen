    "intro": "Scirpus circinatus, commonly known as the curled flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slightly curled appearance at the tips. Scirpus circinatus thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams."
