The plant typically blooms from late summer to early autumn, adding vibrant color to gardens and natural landscapes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Statice bonnetii is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils."
