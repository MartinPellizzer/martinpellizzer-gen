    "intro": "Saxifraga cymbalaria var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal cliffs and maritime environments. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it is considered a hardy species with ornamental value in gardens."
