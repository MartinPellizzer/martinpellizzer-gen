    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta var. atra, commonly known as the Black Hairy Stapelia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, dark purple to black hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its unusual look and low maintenance requirements in both indoor and outdoor settings."
