    "intro": "Saccharum coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bamboo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and tall, slender culms that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Saccharum coarctatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its graceful appearance."
