    "intro": "Shaniodendron, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It is characterized by its showy, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often brightly colored. The plants are native to Southeast Asia and are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves seasonally. Shaniodendron species usually have simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. These plants are valued for their ornamental bracts and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their visual appeal."
