    "intro": "Sporobolus minarum, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bristly spikelets. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a characteristic typical of many grasses in harsh environments. Sporobolus minarum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
