    "intro": "Scirpus modestus, commonly known as the modest sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Scirpus modestus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity."
