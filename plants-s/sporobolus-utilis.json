    "intro": "Sporobolus utilis, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and the presence of awns on its seed heads, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. Sporobolus utilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
