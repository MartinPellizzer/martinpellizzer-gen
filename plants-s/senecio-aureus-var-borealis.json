    "intro": "Senecio aureus var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. This species is adapted to extreme conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
