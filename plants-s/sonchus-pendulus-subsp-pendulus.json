    "intro": "Sonchus pendulus subsp. pendulus, commonly known as the hanging sowthistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems that are usually hairless. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by a cluster of leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are alternate, serrated, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun."
