    "intro": "Silene tenuicaulis, commonly known as slenderstem catchfly, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Silene tenuicaulis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects."
