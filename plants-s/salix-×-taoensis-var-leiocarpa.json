    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 taoensis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and pale yellow to creamy-white catkins, which are typical of willow species. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, silky texture on both sides, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
