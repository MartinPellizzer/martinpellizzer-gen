    "intro": "Saxifraga uliginosa, commonly known as the bog rosemary, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and peatland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Saxifraga uliginosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
