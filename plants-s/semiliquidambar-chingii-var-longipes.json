    "intro": "Semiliquidambar chingii var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed Chinese sandalwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to China. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in Chinese culture. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
