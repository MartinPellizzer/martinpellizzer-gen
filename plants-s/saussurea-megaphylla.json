    "intro": "Saussurea megaphylla, commonly known as the giant saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a fibrous, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cone-like inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
