    "intro": "Stachytarpheta purpurea, commonly known as purpletop vervain, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue bracts that enclose its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers bloom in terminal panicles, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stachytarpheta purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
