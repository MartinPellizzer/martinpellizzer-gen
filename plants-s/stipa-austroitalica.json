    "intro": "Stipa austroitalica, commonly known as the Italian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Italy and parts of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest in gardens. Stipa austroitalica is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
