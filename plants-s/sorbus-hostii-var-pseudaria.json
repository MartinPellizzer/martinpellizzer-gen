    "intro": "Sorbus hostii var. pseudaria, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are typically oval with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn a striking yellow or orange in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its year-round visual interest."
