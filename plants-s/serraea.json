    "intro": "Serraea, commonly known as the \"serrated plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, serrated leaves that give them their common name. Serraea species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and they are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The genus includes several species, such as Serraea crassifolia and Serraea germanica, which are native to parts of Europe and the Middle East."
