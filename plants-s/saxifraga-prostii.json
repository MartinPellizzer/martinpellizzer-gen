    "intro": "Saxifraga prostii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Saxifraga prostii is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
