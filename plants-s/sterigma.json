    "intro": "Sterigma, commonly known as the stamen, is a critical reproductive structure in flowering plants. It consists of two main parts: the filament, which supports the anther, and the anther itself, where pollen grains are produced. The anther contains microsporangia that undergo meiosis to generate haploid pollen grains. These pollen grains are essential for sexual reproduction, as they are transferred to the pistil during pollination. The sterigma plays a vital role in the plant's reproductive cycle and contributes to genetic diversity."
