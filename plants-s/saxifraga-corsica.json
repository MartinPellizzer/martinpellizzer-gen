    "intro": "Saxifraga corsica, commonly known as the Corsican saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, often succulent leaves that are adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing in crevices of limestone or granite rocks. Saxifraga corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, rocky habitats."
