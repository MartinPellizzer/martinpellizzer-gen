It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering structures consist of small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets. Scirpus nitidus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
