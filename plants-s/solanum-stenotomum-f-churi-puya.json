It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. Native to the Andean regions of South America, it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
