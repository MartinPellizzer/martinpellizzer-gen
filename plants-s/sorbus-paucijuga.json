    "intro": "Sorbus paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats."
