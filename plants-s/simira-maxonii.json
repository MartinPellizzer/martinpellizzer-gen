    "intro": "Simira maxonii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional uses."
