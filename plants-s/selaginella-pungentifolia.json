It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores, a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella pungentifolia is also noted for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it a resilient and adaptive species."
