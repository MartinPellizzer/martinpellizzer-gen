    "intro": "Scilla lilacina, commonly known as the purple scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its bulbs are ornamental and can be propagated through division or seed. Scilla lilacina is valued for its early blooming habit and delicate floral display."
