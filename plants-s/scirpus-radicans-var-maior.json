    "intro": "Scirpus radicans var. maior, commonly known as the greater tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, triangular stems that often exceed 1 meter in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, three-ranked spikelets at the top of the stem, which are typically green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
