    "intro": "Scandix pecten-veneris f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the sea holly, is a variant of the sea holly species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, feathery leaves and blue or purple flowers that resemble the shell of the Venus' flower basket. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its foliage is pinnatifid, meaning deeply divided into narrow, thread-like segments. It is a hardy perennial that is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to coastal habitats."
