    "intro": "Salix yezoalpina f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky white hair. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
