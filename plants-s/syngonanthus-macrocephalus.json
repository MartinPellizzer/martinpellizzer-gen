    "intro": "Syngonanthus macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed grassvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the grasslands of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of short hairs. Syngonanthus macrocephalus is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic component of prairie and open woodland habitats."
