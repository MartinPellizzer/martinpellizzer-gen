    "intro": "Sphinctanthus polycarpus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Sphinctanthus polycarpus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
