    "intro": "Schedonorus obtusus, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with small, spike-like inflorescences. Schedonorus obtusus is often used in lawns and sports fields due to its durability and ability to withstand foot traffic."
