    "intro": "Salix glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive glandular surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
