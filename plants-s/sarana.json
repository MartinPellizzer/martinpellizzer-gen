    "intro": "Sarana, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, soft down. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sarana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
