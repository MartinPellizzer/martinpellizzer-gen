    "intro": "Stellaria palustris var. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats. It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often rooting at the nodes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wet environments."
