It features upright, slender stems that bear dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and showy blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, attractive shrub."
