    "intro": "Schinus ramboi, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, bright red berries that are highly visible during the winter months. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters.
