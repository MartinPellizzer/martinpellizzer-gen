    "intro": "Smilax ruiziana, commonly known as the Mexican catclaw, is a shrub-like vine native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough texture. Smilax ruiziana is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its hardy, adaptive nature."
