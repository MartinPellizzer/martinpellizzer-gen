    "intro": "Sonerila parishii, commonly known as the Cook Islands flamewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Cook Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and showy red flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
