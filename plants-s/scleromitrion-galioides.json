    "intro": "Scleromitrion galioides, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces showy, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
