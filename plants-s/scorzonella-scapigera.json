    "intro": "Scorzonella scapigera, commonly known as the scapigerous scorzonella, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Scorzonella scapigera is known for its ability to colonize disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
