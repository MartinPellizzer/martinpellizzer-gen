    "intro": "Sagina saginoides subsp. saginoides, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
