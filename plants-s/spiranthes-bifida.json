    "intro": "Spiranthes bifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Spiranthes bifida is often found in sandy or loamy soils and is known for its graceful, delicate appearance."
