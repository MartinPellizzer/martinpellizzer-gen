    "intro": "Svenhedinia truncata, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit. The plant possesses small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted to attract specific pollinators in its harsh environment. Svenhedinia truncata thrives in rocky soils and requires high levels of sunlight, making it a typical example of a plant adapted to alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss."
