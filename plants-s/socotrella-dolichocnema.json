    "intro": "Socotrella dolichocnema, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula, specifically Socotra Island. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often gnarled trunk, which can grow up to 15 meters tall. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, forming a dense, conical crown. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
