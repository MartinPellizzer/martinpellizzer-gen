    "intro": "Stapelia nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, waxy, star-shaped flowers that resemble dead animals, a feature evolved for attracting pollinators like flies. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Stapelia nudiflora is often cultivated for its unusual appearance and ease of care."
