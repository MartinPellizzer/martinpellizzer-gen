    "intro": "Senecio seemannii, commonly known as the Wooly Senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine white hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
