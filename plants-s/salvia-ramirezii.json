    "intro": "Salvia ramirezii, commonly known as Ramirez's sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
