    "intro": "Synaphea preissii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or decaying wood. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Synaphea preissii is considered a vulnerable species."
