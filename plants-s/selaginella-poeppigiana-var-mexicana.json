    "intro": "Selaginella poeppigiana var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are usually narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in harsh environments and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
