    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 pernhofferi, commonly known as the Hens and Chicks plant, is a hybrid species within the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the main rosette, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Sempervivum \u00d7 pernhofferi is known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and drought."
