It is native to parts of Africa, particularly Tanzania, and is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and showy purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its fruits are small, yellow berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
