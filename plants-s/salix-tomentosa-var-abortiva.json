    "intro": "Salix tomentosa var. abortiva, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white pubescent leaves and catkin-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its leaves are often smaller and more densely hairy than those of the typical Salix tomentosa. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
