    "intro": "Salpichlaena volubilis subsp. thalassica, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a coastal plant native to tropical regions. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal areas, often forming dense mats to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters. This subspecies is well adapted to salt spray and high light conditions, making it a common sight along shorelines."
