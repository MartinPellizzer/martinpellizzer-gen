    "intro": "Scilla ughii, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or woodland habitats. Its bulbs are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes. Scilla ughii is valued for its early blooming habit and delicate floral display."
