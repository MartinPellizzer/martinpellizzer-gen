    "intro": "Salix cardiophyllos, commonly known as the heart-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and oval, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. Salix cardiophyllos is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
