    "intro": "Santaloides sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Sumatra. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and has a unique root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from other plants. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties, making it an important species in traditional and commercial contexts. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in its natural range."
