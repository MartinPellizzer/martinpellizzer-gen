    "intro": "Stipagrostis hirtigluma, commonly known as the hairy steppegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaf blades that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to colonize disturbed soils and stabilize sandy or rocky habitats. Stipagrostis hirtigluma is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it an important component of grassland ecosystems in its native range."
