    "intro": "Styphelia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and forest understories. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to coastal climates with frequent fog and mild temperatures. Styphelia microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
