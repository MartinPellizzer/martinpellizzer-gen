    "intro": "Sticherus flabellatus var. flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate sticherus, is a small, delicate moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed, linear leaves that are often curled at the tips. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are short and club-shaped, emerging from the leafy shoots. This variety is characterized by its fine, intricate structure and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
