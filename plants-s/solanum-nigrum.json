    "intro": "Solanum nigrum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which mature to a dark purple or black color. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids in their raw form, making them potentially harmful if consumed unripe or in large quantities. Solanum nigrum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
