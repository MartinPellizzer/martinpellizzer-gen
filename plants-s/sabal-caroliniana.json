    "intro": "Sabal caroliniana, commonly known as the cabbage palmetto, is a hardy evergreen palm native to the southeastern United States. It features a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 6 feet in length. The plant produces yellowish-pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in Florida and along the Atlantic coast. The cabbage palmetto is also notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray and withstand hurricanes, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
