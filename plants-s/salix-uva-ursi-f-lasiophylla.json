    "intro": "Salix uva-ursi f. lasiophylla, commonly known as the hairyleaf willow, is a variant of the common snowberry willow. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"lasiophylla.\" The plant is typically found in moist, often alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib. The flowers are small and clustered, appearing in catkins, which are typical of willow species."
