It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Sambucus maderensis typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
