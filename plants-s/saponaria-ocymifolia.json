    "intro": "Saponaria ocymifolia, commonly known as the carpet bugle or lady's mantle, is a flowering plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. Saponaria ocymifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers. It is also noted for its mild saponin content, which can create a soapy lather when crushed."
