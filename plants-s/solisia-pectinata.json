    "intro": "Solisia pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Solisia pectinata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
