    "intro": "Salix discolor virescens, commonly known as the green willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Salix discolor virescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
