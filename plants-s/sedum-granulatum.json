    "intro": "Sedum granulatum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
