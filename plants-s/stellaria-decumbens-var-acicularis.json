    "intro": "Stellaria decumbens var. acicularis, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like growth habit, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native range."
