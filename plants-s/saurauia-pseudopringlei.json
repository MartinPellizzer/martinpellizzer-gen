It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, which are surrounded by bracts. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
