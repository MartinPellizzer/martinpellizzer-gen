    "intro": "Salvia flocculosa, commonly known as wooly sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its soft, gray-green foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it both visually appealing and ecologically beneficial."
