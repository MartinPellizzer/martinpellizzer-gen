    "intro": "Sedum glaciale, commonly known as the glacier sedum, is a succulent plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold climates and low light conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil. Sedum glaciale is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler climates."
