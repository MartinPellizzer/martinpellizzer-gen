It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that are often clustered together. This variety is native to western North America and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant's botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
