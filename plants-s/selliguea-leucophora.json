    "intro": "Selliguea leucophora, commonly known as the white-veined liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thalli, which are typically green and covered in a layer of translucent, waxy cells. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction and are often clustered at the base of the thallus. Selliguea leucophora plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms."
