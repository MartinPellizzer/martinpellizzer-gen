It is characterized by its clusters of small, dark purple berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though they should be cooked before consumption."
