    "intro": "Statice coriacea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in dune environments and coastal grasslands. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice coriacea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging coastal climates."
