It belongs to the family Haloragaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that facilitate efficient photosynthesis in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by water currents rather than insects. Staurogyne wawrana thrives in slow-moving to still waters, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its growth habits make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, supporting diverse aquatic life."
