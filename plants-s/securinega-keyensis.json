    "intro": "Securinega keyensis, commonly known as Key's securinega, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and parts of the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species known for their milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy species in tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
