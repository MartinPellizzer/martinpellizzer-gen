    "intro": "Saussurea pseudosquarrosa, commonly known as the Himalayan gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Saussurea pseudosquarrosa is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
