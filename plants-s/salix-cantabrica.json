    "intro": "Salix cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of northern Spain and southern France. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that release minute seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and coastal dunes, often tolerating salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
