It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
