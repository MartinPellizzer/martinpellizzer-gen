    "intro": "Selaginella apoda subsp. eclipes, commonly known as the pale spore moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its diminutive, spore-bearing structures. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, which is a feature of the genus Selaginella. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a distinct, often glaucous appearance. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
