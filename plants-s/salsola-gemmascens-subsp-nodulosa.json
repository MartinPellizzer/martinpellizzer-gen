    "intro": "Salsola gemmascens subsp. nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular Russian thistle, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, spiny leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in disturbed soils. It is native to Central Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it thrives in coastal and inland saline habitats."
