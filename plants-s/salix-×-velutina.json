    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 velutina, commonly known as the silky willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its soft, silken texture on its leaves and branches. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences that release wind-pollinated seeds, contributing to its spread in riparian habitats. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. Salix \u00d7 velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
