    "intro": "Shibateranthis longistipitata, commonly known as the long-stemmed shibateranthis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
