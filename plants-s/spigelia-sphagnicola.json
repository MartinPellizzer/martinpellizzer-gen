    "intro": "Spigelia sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog spigelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and pine woods. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Spigelia sphagnicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats."
