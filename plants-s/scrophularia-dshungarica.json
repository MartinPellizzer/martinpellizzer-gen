    "intro": "Scrophularia dshungarica, commonly known as the Tibetan figwort, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
