    "intro": "Sophora bifolia, commonly known as the twinleaf sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into two pairs of leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that mature in the fall. Sophora bifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats."
