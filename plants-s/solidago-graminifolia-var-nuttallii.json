It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its slender stature and is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
