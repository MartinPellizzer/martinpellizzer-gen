It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plants are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stenaria species are generally perennial herbs that produce seeds through a capsule-like structure. Their botanical features make them valuable for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
