It has slender, branched stems that are often covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates. Staurogyne strigosa is often found in slow-moving or still waters such as lakes and ponds."
