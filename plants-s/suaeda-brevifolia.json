    "intro": "Suaeda brevifolia, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or red, and it produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. Suaeda brevifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
