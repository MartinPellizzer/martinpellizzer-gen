    "intro": "Salix brownii var. petraea, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
