    "intro": "Salsola glauca var. cinerascens, commonly known as silverblite, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in desert environments and along coastal dunes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
