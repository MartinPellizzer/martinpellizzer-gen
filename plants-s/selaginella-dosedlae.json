    "intro": "Selaginella dosedlae, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage. Selaginella dosedlae is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
