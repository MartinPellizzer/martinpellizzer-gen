    "intro": "Sphaeropteris parksiae, commonly known as the Philippine cycad, is a member of the cycad family, Cycadaceae. It is a large, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, pinnately compound leaves. Native to the Philippines, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatch in some regions."
