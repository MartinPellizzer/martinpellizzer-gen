It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
