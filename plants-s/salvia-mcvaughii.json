    "intro": "Salvia mcvaughii, commonly known as McVaugh's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a grayish-green hue and produces striking violet to purple flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms. Salvia mcvaughii is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
