    "intro": "Senecio jacsonii, commonly known as Jackson's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
