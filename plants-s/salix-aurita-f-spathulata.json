    "intro": "Salix aurita f. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow or narrow-leaf willow, is a variant of the willow species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, where it thrives in wet or semi-aquatic conditions. Its catkins are an important feature, producing both male and female flowers in separate clusters. This willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects."
