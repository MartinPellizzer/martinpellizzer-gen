    "intro": "Selaginella atroviridis, commonly known as the black-stem spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark green, strap-like leaves and a wiry, branching stem. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella atroviridis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
