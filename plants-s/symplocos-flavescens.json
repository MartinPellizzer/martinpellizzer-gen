It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountain forests. Symplocos flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
