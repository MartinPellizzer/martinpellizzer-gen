    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 vetteriana, commonly known as the Vetter's pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, tubular leaves that form specialized pitfall traps to capture prey. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with a yellow or green throat, and they secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to break down captured insects. Sarracenia \u00d7 vetteriana thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure for optimal growth. It is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and unique ecological adaptations."
