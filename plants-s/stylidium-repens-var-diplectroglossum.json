    "intro": "Stylidium repens var. diplectroglossum, commonly known as the wandering bell-flower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features a distinctive glandular structure on its stem, which is used to capture small insects, aiding in its nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variant is part of the genus Stylidium, known for its unique trapping mechanisms and ecological adaptations."
