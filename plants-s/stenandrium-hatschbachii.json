    "intro": "Stenandrium hatschbachii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's stenandrium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences and vibrant, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
