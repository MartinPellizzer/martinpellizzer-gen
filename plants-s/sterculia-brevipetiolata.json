    "intro": "Sterculia brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled sterculia, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves with short petioles. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in local communities."
