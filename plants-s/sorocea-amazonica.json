    "intro": "Sorocea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian sorocea, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are known to have medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for their antiseptic qualities. Due to habitat loss, Sorocea amazonica is now classified as an endangered species."
