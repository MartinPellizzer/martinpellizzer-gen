    "intro": "Sessilistigma radians, commonly known as the radiant sessile-stigma plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. Its flowers feature sessile stigmas, which are attached directly to the ovary without a stalk, a trait that sets it apart from many other flowering plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Sessilistigma radians is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
