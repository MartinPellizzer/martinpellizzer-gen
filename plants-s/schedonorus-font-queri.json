    "intro": "Schedonorus font-queri, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, soft foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
