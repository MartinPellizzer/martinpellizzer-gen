    "intro": "Sphaeralcea sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces spherical seed pods that burst open when mature to disperse seeds. Sphaeralcea sessiliflora is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
