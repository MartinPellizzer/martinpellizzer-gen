    "intro": "Saussurea grandifolia var. nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko's giant saffron, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
