    "intro": "Salvia alvajaca, commonly known as the alpine sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Salvia alvajaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
