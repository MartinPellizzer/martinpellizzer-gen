    "intro": "Spiranthes petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually pink or white and bloom from late summer to early fall. Spiranthes petiolaris is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
