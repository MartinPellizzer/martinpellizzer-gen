    "intro": "Solanum crispum var. eleagnifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by dark purple or black berries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
