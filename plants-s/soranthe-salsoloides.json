    "intro": "Soranthe salsoloides, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It thrives in coastal regions and saline soils, exhibiting succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to access deep water sources in nutrient-poor soils. Soranthe salsoloides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal ecosystems."
