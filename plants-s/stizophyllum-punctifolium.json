    "intro": "Stizophyllum punctifolium, commonly known as the spotted leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds with a unique pattern of small, rounded lobes along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of short, fibrous roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded formations along the fronds, giving it its common name."
