    "intro": "Salix albida, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its elongated, narrow leaves that are usually pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. Salix albida is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
