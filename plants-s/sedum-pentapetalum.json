    "intro": "Sedum pentapetalum, commonly known as the five-petaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It blooms in the summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Sedum pentapetalum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
