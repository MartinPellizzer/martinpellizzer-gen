It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. This variety is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporophytes are typically small and produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, resilient mats."
