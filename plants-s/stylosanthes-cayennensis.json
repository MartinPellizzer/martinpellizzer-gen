It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems that often bear small, yellow flowers. The plant produces seed pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are typically used in forage and soil improvement. Stylosanthes cayennensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a valuable crop in dryland agriculture. It also has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility."
