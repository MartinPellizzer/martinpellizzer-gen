    "intro": "Solenostemon platostomoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
