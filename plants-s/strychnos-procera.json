    "intro": "Strychnos procera, commonly known as the African angel's trumpets, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine. Strychnos procera is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
