    "intro": "Sobralia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered sobralia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that bear two to three flowers per stem. The plant produces large, velvety leaves that are typically dark green in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sobralia biflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
