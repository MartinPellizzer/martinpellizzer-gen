    "intro": "Sicyos erostratus var. herbstii, commonly known as the Herbst's bottle gourd, is a variant of the bottle gourd plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a vining, annual herb that produces large, smooth, bottle-shaped fruits. The plant has a robust root system and thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow quite large, often reaching up to 30 cm in diameter. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still green and immature, though it can be left to mature into a hard, dry shell."
