It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are usually blue-gray in color, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.
