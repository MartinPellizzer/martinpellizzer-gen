    "intro": "Schefflera harmsii, commonly known as the African umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of palmate leaves that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
