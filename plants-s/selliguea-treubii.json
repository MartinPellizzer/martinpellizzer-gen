    "intro": "Selliguea treubii, commonly known as the tropical moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with closely packed leafy shoots that are often covered in a thin layer of water. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Selliguea treubii plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
