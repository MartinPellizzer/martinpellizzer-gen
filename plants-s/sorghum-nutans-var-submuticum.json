    "intro": "Sorghum nutans var. submuticum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short stature, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional agriculture and forage production."
