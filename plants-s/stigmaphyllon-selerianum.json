    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon selerianum, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or starfruit vine, is a climbing plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Stigmaphyllon selerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
