    "intro": "Salvia chilensis, commonly known as Chilean sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Salvia chilensis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic benefits."
