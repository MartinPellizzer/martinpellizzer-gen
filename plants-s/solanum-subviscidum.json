    "intro": "Solanum subviscidum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in humid, tropical environments and can thrive in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
