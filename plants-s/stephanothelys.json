It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble stars, surrounded by a green spathe. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Stephanothelys is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
