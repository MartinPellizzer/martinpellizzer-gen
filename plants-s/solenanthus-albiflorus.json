It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, woody fruits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
