    "intro": "Sorbus pseudoscandica, commonly known as the Swedish whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are a food source for birds. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in forest edges or mountainous regions. The bark is smooth and greyish, with shallow fissures, and the wood is dense and strong."
