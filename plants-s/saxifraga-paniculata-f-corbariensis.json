It is a low-growing perennial with dense, mat-forming foliage and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy leaves and a compact growth habit that helps it survive in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
