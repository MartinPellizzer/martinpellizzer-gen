    "intro": "Semenovia frigida, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, adapted to attract pollinators in its extreme climate. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. Semenovia frigida plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
