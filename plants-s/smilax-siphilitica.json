It features stout, thorned stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Smilax siphilitica is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through both runners and seed dispersal."
