    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rijosa, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along waterways."
