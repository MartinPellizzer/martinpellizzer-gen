    "intro": "Stenogyne kaalae var. pearsallii, commonly known as the Pearsall's stenogyne, is a rare Hawaiian plant species endemic to the island of Oahu. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. The plant grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Hawaiian shoreline. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under both state and federal conservation laws."
