    "intro": "Salvinia molesta, commonly known as water fern or floating mosquito fern, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its small, feather-like leaves that are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can rapidly colonize water surfaces, forming dense mats. Its rapid growth rate and ability to reproduce vegetatively make it an invasive species in many regions. Salvinia molesta can significantly impact aquatic ecosystems by reducing light penetration, oxygen levels, and habitat availability for native species."
