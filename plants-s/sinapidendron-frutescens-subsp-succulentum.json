    "intro": "Sinapidendron frutescens subsp. succulentum, commonly known as the succulent euphorbia, is a shrub-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing stems and leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its succulent nature allows it to survive in regions with low rainfall. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
