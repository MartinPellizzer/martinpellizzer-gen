    "intro": "Stelis ferax, commonly known as the wild orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis ferax is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests."
