    "intro": "Stilago diandra, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Stilago diandra plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
