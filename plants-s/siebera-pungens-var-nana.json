It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy texture and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves remain evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round interest in gardens. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact size and hardy nature."
