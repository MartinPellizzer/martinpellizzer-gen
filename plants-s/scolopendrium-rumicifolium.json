    "intro": "Scolopendrium rumicifolium, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a basket, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Scolopendrium rumicifolium thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
