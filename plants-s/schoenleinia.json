    "intro": "Schoenleinia, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. Schoenleinia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. These plants are often found in high-elevation areas and are adapted to cold, harsh climates."
