    "intro": "Stelis obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle, and relies on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. The flowers bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat."
