    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers bloom during the warm season and are pollinated by insects such as flies and beetles. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
