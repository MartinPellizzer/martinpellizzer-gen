    "intro": "Spiraea miyajimensis, commonly known as the Japanese spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and compact form."
