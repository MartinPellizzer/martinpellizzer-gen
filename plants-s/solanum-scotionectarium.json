    "intro": "Solanum scotionectarium, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by yellowish berries that ripen in the summer. Solanum scotionectarium is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and peppers."
