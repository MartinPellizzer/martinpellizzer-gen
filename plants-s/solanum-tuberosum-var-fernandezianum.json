    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. fernandezianum, commonly known as the Fernandezian potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a fern-like structure that distinguishes it from typical potato varieties. This variant is native to South America, particularly regions of Argentina and Chile, where it grows in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, tuberous roots that are often used in local traditional agriculture. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving potato resilience."
