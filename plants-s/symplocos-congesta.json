    "intro": "Symplocos congesta, commonly known as the clustered waxleaf. It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Symplocos congesta thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
