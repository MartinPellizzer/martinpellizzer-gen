    "intro": "Salsola caroxylon, commonly known as black goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically triangular in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a common component of saline soils and coastal environments. Salsola caroxylon plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
