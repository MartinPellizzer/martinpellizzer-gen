    "intro": "Serianthes lifouensis, commonly known as the Lifou ebony, is a rare and critically endangered tree species native to the island of Lifou in the French territory of New Caledonia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dark, heavy timber and dense canopy. The plant has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is of significant botanical interest and conservation concern."
