    "intro": "Solanum ternatum, commonly known as the three-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing characteristic. The plant contains alkaloids and is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae."
