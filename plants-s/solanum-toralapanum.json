It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, ovate leaves. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is generally avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal properties."
