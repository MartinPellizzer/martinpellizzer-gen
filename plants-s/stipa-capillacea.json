    "intro": "Stipa capillacea, commonly known as slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its slender stems and narrow leaves are adaptations to arid or semi-arid conditions, allowing it to conserve water efficiently. Stipa capillacea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also important in ecological restoration projects."
