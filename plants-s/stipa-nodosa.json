    "intro": "Stipa nodosa, commonly known as nodding needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that often nod or droop. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Stipa nodosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
