    "intro": "Serratula bachtiarica, commonly known as the Persian sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a serrated edge, giving it its scientific name. Serratula bachtiarica is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and livestock."
