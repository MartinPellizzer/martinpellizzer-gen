It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
