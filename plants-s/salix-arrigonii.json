    "intro": "Salix arrigonii, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its striking red or pink flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. This species thrives in moist environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native range through its deep root system. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
