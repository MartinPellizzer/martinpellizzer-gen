    "intro": "Sorbus humphreyana, commonly known as the Humbrey's whitebeams, is a species of rowan tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with finely toothed margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
