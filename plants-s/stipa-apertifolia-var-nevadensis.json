    "intro": "Stipa apertifolia var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in regions with low precipitation. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
