It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
