    "intro": "Scoparia neglecta, commonly known as the common scurvygrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has a sprawling growth habit with many branches. The plant features small, green, ovate leaves and produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in fields, and near waterways. Scoparia neglecta is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its rapid growth cycle."
