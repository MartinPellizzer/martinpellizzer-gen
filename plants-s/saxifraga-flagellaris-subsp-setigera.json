    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris subsp. setigera, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that produce small, white or pink flowers. Its leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, cold climates due to its thick, fleshy leaves and compact growth form."
