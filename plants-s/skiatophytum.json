    "intro": "Skiatophytum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species known for their latex-like sap. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Skiatophytum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and minimal water requirements. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in local ecosystems."
