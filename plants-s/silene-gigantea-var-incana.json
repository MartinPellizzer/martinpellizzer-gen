The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Silene gigantea var. incana is adapted to cold, harsh environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
