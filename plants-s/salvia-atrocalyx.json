    "intro": "Salvia atrocalyx, commonly known as black calyx sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark violet to almost black calyces that enclose its flowers, which are typically pale blue to lavender in color. The plant produces slender, erect stems covered with fine hairs and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture. It blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia atrocalyx is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
