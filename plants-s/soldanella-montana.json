    "intro": "Soldanella montana, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
