    "intro": "Spergularia stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruited sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Spergularia stenocarpa is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
