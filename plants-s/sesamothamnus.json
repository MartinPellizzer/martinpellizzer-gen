    "intro": "Sesamothamnus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and opposite, narrow leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Sesamothamnus species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and succulent leaves to store water. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and are valued for their ornamental and medicinal properties."
