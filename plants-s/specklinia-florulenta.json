    "intro": "Specklinia florulenta, commonly known as the jewel orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Specklinia florulenta is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
