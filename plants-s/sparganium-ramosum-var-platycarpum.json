    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum var. platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited bur reed, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, branching stems that grow from the water's surface to submerged or floating leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its distinctive, spiny, berry-like fruits are often used for seed dispersal. This variant is characterized by its broader, more robust fruits compared to other varieties of Sparganium."
