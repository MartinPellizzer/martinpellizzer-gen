    "intro": "Sagus americana, commonly known as the American saguaro, is a unique cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 40 feet in height. The plant has a distinctive branching pattern, with arms that develop from the main stem as it matures. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by bats and insects. The saguaro is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem to survive long dry periods."
