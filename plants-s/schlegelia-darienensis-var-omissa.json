    "intro": "Schlegelia darienensis var. omissa, commonly known as the Darien schlegelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the understory of humid tropical forests in South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
