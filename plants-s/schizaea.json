    "intro": "Schizaea, commonly known as the club moss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the order Microspermales. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and their ability to form dense, low-growing mats or cushions. Schizaea species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play a significant role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Despite their ancient lineage, some Schizaea species are still cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance."
