    "intro": "Silene kuschakewiczii var. apiculata, commonly known as the Kuschakewicz's campion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with simple, lanceolate leaves and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsules as its fruit, containing numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
