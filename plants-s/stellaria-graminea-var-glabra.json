    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. glabra, commonly known as smooth starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie flat on the ground, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces tiny white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have five petals that are star-shaped, giving the plant its common name. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
