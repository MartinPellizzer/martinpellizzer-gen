    "intro": "Solanum semiconnatum, commonly known as the nightshade or the poisonberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 6 meters tall, featuring simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red when ripe, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum semiconnatum is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
