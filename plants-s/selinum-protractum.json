    "intro": "Selinum protractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Selinum protractum is valued in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antispasmodic properties."
