    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos esmeraldae, commonly known as the Emerald Beauty orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant green and white floral display, with intricate petal structures that reflect its evolutionary adaptations to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant typically grows on tree bark, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit, which allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a unique fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
