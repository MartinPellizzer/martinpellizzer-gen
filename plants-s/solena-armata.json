    "intro": "Solena armata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. Solena armata is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky landscapes."
