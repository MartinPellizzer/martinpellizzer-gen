    "intro": "Scleria sellowiana, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble a wheel. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, often with a bluish or purplish hue. Scleria sellowiana is notable for its ability to thrive in water-saturated soils and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
