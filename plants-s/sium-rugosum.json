It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spikes, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Sium rugosum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for aquatic organisms."
