    "intro": "Samyda enneandria, commonly known as the African bloodwood, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to the savannas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark that often exudes a reddish hue, giving it its common name. The plant has compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing elliptical seeds. Samyda enneandria is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
