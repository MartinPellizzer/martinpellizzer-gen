    "intro": "Spongiocarpella potaninii, commonly known as the woolly spongiocarpella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
