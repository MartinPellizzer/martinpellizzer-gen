    "intro": "Saxifraga retusa subsp. wulfeniana, commonly known as the Woolly Saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and high-altitude landscapes."
