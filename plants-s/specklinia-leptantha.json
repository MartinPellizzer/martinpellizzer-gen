    "intro": "Specklinia leptantha, commonly known as the slender-stemmed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, anchoring itself with its rhizomes without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Specklinia leptantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
