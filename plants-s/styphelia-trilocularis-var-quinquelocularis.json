    "intro": "Styphelia trilocularis var. quinquelocularis, commonly known as the five-chambered stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its unique botanical feature is the five-chambered structure of its fruit, which distinguishes it from the typical three-chambered form of the species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in pine forests or rocky habitats."
