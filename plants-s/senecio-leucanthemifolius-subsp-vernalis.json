    "intro": "Senecio leucanthemifolius subsp. vernalis, commonly known as the spring everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a bluish-gray hue due to a thick layer of trichomes. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
