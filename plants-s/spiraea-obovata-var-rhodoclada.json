    "intro": "Spiraea obovata var. rhodoclada, commonly known as the redleaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that create a weeping habit, and its foliage transitions from bright green in spring to vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in white or pale pink during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth and seasonal color changes make it a visually appealing addition to gardens and landscapes."
