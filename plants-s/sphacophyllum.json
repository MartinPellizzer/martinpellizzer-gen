    "intro": "Sphacophyllum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Sphacophyllum is often found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. Its thallus is usually crust-like and can vary in color from pale green to dark brown. This lichen plays an important role in soil formation and as an indicator of environmental conditions."
