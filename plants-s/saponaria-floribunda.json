    "intro": "Saponaria floribunda, commonly known as clustered soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its mild soap-like scent when crushed. Saponaria floribunda is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
