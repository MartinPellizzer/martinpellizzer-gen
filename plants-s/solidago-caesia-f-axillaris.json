    "intro": "Solidago caesia f. axillaris, commonly known as the axillary goldenrod, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The axillary form refers to its growth habit, where flowering occurs along the leaf axils, distinguishing it from the typical form of Solidago caesia."
