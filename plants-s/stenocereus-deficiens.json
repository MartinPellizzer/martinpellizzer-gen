    "intro": "Stenocereus deficiens, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into multiple stems, resembling organ pipes. The plant produces white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains edible seeds. This plant is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide shade and reduce water loss."
