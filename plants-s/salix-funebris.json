    "intro": "Salix funebris, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and narrow, elongated leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
