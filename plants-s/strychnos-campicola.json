    "intro": "Strychnos campicola, commonly known as the mountain strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique growth habit, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
