    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 dodeana, commonly known as the Dodeana willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its slender, weeping branches and delicate foliage. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly waterlogged soils. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and its leaves are often lance-shaped with a serrated edge. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful appearance. The Dodeana willow is also notable for its adaptability to various environmental conditions, making it a resilient choice for ecological restoration projects."
