    "intro": "Salix dyscrita, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Salix dyscrita plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
