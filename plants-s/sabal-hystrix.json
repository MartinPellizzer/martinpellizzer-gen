    "intro": "Sabal hystrix, commonly known as the cabbage palm, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous sheath that gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that can grow up to 5 meters in diameter, contributing to its striking visual presence. Its inflorescence consists of a branched cluster of small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into blue-black berries. Sabal hystrix is well adapted to coastal and limestone soils, making it a resilient and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
