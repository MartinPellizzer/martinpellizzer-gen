    "intro": "Satyrium eurycalcaratum, commonly known as the broad-spurred orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a slender, erect stem with several elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It blooms during the late spring to early summer season, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
