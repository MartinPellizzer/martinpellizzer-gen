    "intro": "Spathiphyllum pictum, commonly known as the painted peace lily, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with distinctive white and green variegation. The plant produces elegant white spathes that enclose its small, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum pictum is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
