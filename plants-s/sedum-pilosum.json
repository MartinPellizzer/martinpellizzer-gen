    "intro": "Sedum pilosum, commonly known as the wooly sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, low-moisture conditions."
