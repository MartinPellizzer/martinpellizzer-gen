    "intro": "Seruneum strigulosum, commonly known as the rough seruneum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender stems covered in short, stiff hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture due to their densely packed, stiff trichomes. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
