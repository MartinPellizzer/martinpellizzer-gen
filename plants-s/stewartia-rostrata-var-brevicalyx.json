    "intro": "Stewartia rostrata var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The tree produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
