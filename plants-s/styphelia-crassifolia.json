    "intro": "Styphelia crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are broad and leathery, which helps it conserve moisture in its often harsh environment. Styphelia crassifolia is also known for its ecological importance, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
