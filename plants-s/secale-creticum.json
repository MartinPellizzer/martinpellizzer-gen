    "intro": "Secale creticum, commonly known as Cretan ryegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets per spikelet. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Secale creticum is primarily grown as a forage crop and has some historical use in traditional agriculture."
