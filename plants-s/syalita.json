    "intro": "Syalita, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming a low, compact rosette. Syalita thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ease of care and long-lasting blooms."
