    "intro": "Spiranthes gutturosa, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with yellow markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Spiranthes gutturosa is often found in association with other orchid species and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
