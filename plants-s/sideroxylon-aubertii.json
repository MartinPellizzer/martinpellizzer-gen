    "intro": "Sideroxylon aubertii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, often flaky bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Sideroxylon aubertii is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
