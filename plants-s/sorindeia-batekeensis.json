It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, simple leaves, and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
