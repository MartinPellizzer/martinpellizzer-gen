    "intro": "Stelis exquisita, commonly known as the exquisite stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires well-draining, loose substrate for optimal growth. Stelis exquisita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
