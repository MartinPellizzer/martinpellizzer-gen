    "intro": "Selaginella ovalifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features linear to ovate leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. Selaginella ovalifolia produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear the sporangia for spore dispersal. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest understories."
