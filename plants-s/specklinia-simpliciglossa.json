    "intro": "Specklinia simpliciglossa, commonly known as the simple-tongued orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a spike, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
