    "intro": "Solanum tiinae, commonly known as the Tiina's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruits are berries that mature to a deep blue color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. Due to its restricted distribution and limited study, Solanum tiinae remains a relatively obscure member of the Solanaceae family."
