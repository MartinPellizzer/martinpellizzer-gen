It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy composite flower heads. The plant features dense, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help in reducing water loss. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
