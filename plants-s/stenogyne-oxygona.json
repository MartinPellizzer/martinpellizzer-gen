    "intro": "Stenogyne oxygona, commonly known as the Hawaiian oxygona, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in coastal or lowland habitats. It has small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
