    "intro": "Schoenorchis spatulata, commonly known as the spoon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a raceme, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. This orchid is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish."
