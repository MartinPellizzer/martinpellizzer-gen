    "intro": "Stenofilix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, linear leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Stenofilix is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
