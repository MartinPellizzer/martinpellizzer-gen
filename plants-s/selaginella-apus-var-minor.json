    "intro": "Selaginella apus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the ground. This variety is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of North America, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, and it is adapted to survive in environments with low moisture. Its unique morphology and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
