    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 semilapponum, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix lapponum and Salix herbacea, characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and tundra regions. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a silvery underside. Salix \u00d7 semilapponum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in wetland environments."
