    "intro": "Sobralia kerryae, commonly known as the Kerry's sobralia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sobralia kerryae is considered a conservation concern."
