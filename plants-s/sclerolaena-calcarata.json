    "intro": "Sclerolaena calcarata, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
