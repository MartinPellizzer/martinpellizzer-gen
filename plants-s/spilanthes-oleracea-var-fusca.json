    "intro": "Spilanthes oleracea var. fusca, commonly known as the black root or Indian mustard, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pungent, spicy scent. The plant produces a taproot that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its leaves are edible and can be used in cooking, though they have a strong, mustard-like flavor. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
