    "intro": "Stelis pedanocaulon, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that often resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other plants rather than in soil. Stelis pedanocaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
