    "intro": "Swainsona uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower swainsona, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Swainsona uniflora is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
