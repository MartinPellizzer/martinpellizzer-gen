    "intro": "Solanum osbeckii, commonly known as the Osbeck's nightshade, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically features simple, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are usually green when immature and turn red when ripe, containing toxic compounds similar to other members of the nightshade family. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
