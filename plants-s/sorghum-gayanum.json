    "intro": "Sorghum gayanum, commonly known as the Gaya sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, typically in shades of red, purple, or yellow. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Sorghum gayanum is often used for forage, erosion control, and traditional cultural practices in its native regions."
