It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Spiranthes rosulata is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, showcasing a unique symbiotic relationship."
