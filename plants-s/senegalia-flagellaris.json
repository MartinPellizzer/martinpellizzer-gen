    "intro": "Senegalia flagellaris, commonly known as the desert shrub or flagellate acacia, is a drought-tolerant plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its adaptations to harsh environments make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
