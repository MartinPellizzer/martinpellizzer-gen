    "intro": "Sedum carneum, commonly known as the fleshy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to red, typically blooming in summer. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, where it forms dense mats. Sedum carneum is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
