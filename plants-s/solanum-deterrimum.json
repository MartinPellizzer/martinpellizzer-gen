It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum deterrimum is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
