    "intro": "Specklinia granulosa, commonly known as the granular specklinia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that produce fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are usually thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Specklinia granulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
