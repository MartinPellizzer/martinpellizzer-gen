    "intro": "Sorbus malus, commonly known as whitebeams, is a genus of about 150 species of shrubs and small trees in the family Rosaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, aggregate fruits that resemble berries. Sorbus malus typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The flowers are usually white or pink and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The wood of Sorbus malus is hard and durable, historically used for tool handles and other small wooden items."
