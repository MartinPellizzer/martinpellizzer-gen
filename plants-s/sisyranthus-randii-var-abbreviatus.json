    "intro": "Sisyranthus randii var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the dwarf sisyranthus, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, humid microhabitats. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and strikingly colorful, spurred flowers that range from yellow to orange. It is typically found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest understories, where it forms dense clumps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
