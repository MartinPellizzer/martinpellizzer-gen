    "intro": "Sorghum miliaceum var. parvispiculum, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a small-seeded grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, triangular grains. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it well-suited for marginal soils and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear the tiny seeds. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and nutritional content, making it an important crop in certain regions."
