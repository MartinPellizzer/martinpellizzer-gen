    "intro": "Sedum hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of the western United States and parts of Canada. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its landscape. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum hookeri is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to attract pollinators."
