    "intro": "Swartzia linharensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which has historically been valued for musical instruments and fine furniture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Swartzia linharensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in local ecosystems. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
