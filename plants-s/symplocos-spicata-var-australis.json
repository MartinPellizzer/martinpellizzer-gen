    "intro": "Symplocos spicata var. australis, commonly known as the Australian holly, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. It is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
