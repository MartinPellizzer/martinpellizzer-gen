    "intro": "Salix majalis, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides of its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The silver willow is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
