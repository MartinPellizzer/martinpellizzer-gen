    "intro": "Senecio parascitus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to survive in low-water environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio parascitus produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
