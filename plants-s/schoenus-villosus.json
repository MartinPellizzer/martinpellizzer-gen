    "intro": "Schoenus villosus, commonly known as the silky bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and soft, silky hairs that cover its leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Schoenus villosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
