It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and usually leathery leaves that are dark green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its unique properties and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
