    "intro": "Scorzonera aspera, commonly known as the rough scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and basal leaves that are typically lobed or dissected. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which are often arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. Its root system is notable for being thick and fleshy, which contributes to its medicinal and culinary uses in some traditional practices. Scorzonera aspera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
