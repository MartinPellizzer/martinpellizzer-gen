    "intro": "Solanum antidotum, commonly known as the poison apple, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and oval-shaped berries. The plant produces toxic berries that contain solanine, a glycoalkaloid toxin harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and the stems are hairy. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation, though it has been studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
