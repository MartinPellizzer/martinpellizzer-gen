It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a silvery underside, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed sites. This variant is closely related to other species in the Stellaria genus, sharing similar morphological features and ecological preferences."
