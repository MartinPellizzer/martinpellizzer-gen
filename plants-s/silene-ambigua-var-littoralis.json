    "intro": "Silene ambigua var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. Silene ambigua var. littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
