    "intro": "Santolina incana, commonly known as silver sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage with a distinctive aromatic scent, which is due to its high concentration of essential oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina incana is also valued for its use in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
