    "intro": "Sideroxylon macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces capsules as fruit. The wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and tool-making."
