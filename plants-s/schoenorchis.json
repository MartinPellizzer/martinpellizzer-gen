    "intro": "Schoenorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphyte rather than a terrestrial plant. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that enhance its ethereal appearance. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Schoenorchis is considered endangered in many regions."
