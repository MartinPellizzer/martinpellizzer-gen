    "intro": "Smilax javensis, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by yellowish berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a pointed tip and a rough texture. Smilax javensis is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its hardy, invasive growth habit."
