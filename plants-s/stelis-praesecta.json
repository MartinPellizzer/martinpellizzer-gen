    "intro": "Stelis praesecta, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a striking combination of colors and intricate patterns. Stelis praesecta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
