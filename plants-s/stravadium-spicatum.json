    "intro": "Stravadium spicatum, commonly known as the spikeflower aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
