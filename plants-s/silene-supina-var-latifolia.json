    "intro": "Silene supina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sandstem, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
