    "intro": "Sphaeranthus spathulatus, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small annual herb with a distinctive globular shape, featuring a short stem and a cluster of fleshy, spathulate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which is typically borne on a short peduncle. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Sphaeranthus spathulatus is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
