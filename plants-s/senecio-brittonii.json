    "intro": "Senecio brittonii, commonly known as Britton's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in rocky soils and open habitats. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio brittonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
