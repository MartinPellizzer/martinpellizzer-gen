    "intro": "Saussurea hisauchii, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features a robust root system and produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, rhizomatous stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
