    "intro": "Solidago decumbens var. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and bright yellow flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodland or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes. This variant is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
