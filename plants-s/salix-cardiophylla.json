    "intro": "Salix cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf willow, is a species of willow native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salix cardiophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
