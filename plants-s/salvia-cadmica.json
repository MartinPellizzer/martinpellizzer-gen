    "intro": "Salvia cadmica, commonly known as the cadmium sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in dense whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often covered in a fuzzy texture. Salvia cadmica is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
