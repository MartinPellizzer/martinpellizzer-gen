It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Silene lanuginosa is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological features."
