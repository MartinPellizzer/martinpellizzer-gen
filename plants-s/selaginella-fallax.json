    "intro": "Selaginella fallax, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, zigzag appearance. Selaginella fallax reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
