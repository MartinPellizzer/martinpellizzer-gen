It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense clusters of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Scirpus \u00d7 peckii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
