    "intro": "Salix glauca var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in moist, well-drained soils, thriving in riparian habitats. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
