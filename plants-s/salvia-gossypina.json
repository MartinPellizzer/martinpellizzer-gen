    "intro": "Salvia gossypina, commonly known as cotton sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Salvia gossypina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
