    "intro": "Stellaria fischeriana, commonly known as Fischer's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
