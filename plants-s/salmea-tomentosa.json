    "intro": "Salmea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly salmea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in fine, white hairs, providing insulation against extreme temperatures. Salmea tomentosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive with minimal water availability."
