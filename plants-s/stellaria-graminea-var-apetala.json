    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. apetala, commonly known as the leafy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The variety apetala is notable for lacking petals, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other varieties of Stellaria graminea. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant is often found in temperate climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
