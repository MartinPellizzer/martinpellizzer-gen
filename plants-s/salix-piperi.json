    "intro": "Salix piperi, commonly known as the western willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in moist, often riparian habitats and is often found along streams and riverbanks. Salix piperi plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
