    "intro": "Spartium pilosum, commonly known as silky sainfoin, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely hairy foliage, which gives it its common name, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Spartium pilosum is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
