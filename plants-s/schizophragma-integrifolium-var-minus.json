    "intro": "Schizophragma integrifolium var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, twining stems that can climb to heights of several meters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with smooth margins and a dark green upper surface. Its fragrant, tubular flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters during late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often considered less palatable compared to other honeysuckle varieties."
