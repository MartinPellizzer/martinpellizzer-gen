    "intro": "Selaginella plumea var. trichobasis, commonly known as the trichobasis spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant exhibits a unique form of vegetative reproduction through its protonemal system, which allows it to spread and colonize new areas. It is often found in rocky crevices or on the forest floor in temperate regions. This variant is distinguished by its fine, hairy structures on the strobila, which contribute to its common name."
