    "intro": "Scirpus cumingii, commonly known as Cuming's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges. Scirpus cumingii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
