    "intro": "Stanhopea tricornis subsp. stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-lipped stanhopea, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped pseudobulbs and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with flowers that have a distinctive three-lobed lip, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled greenhouse settings."
