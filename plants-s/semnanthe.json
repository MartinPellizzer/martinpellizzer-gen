    "intro": "Semnanthe, commonly known as the Persian rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. The flowers are often used in traditional Persian floral arrangements."
