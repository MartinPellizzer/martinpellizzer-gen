    "intro": "Solanum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a sprawling growth habit with long, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Solanum stoloniferum is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed or cultivated areas."
