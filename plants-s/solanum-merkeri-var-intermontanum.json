    "intro": "Solanum merkeri var. intermontanum, commonly known as the Sierra Madre nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
