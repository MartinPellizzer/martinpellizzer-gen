    "intro": "Styphelia tameiameiae, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and forest understories. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
