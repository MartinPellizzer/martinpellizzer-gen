    "intro": "Sporobolus rigens var. expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf sandbur, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, spiny seed heads that aid in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are typically flat and narrow, with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer. This species is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
