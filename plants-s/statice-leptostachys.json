    "intro": "Statice leptostachys, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late summer to autumn. Its salt tolerance makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and as a decorative plant in dry landscapes. Statice leptostachys is also valued for its use in floral arrangements and as a natural dye source."
