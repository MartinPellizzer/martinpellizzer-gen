    "intro": "Silene viscosa var. quadriloba, commonly known as the sticky willow herb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
