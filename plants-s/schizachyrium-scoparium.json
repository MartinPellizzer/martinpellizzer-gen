    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and woodland environments. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall, and its slender, branched flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its deep root system. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Schizachyrium scoparium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
