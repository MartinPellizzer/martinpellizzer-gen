    "intro": "Serjania brachyphylla, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species but not typically consumed by humans. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
