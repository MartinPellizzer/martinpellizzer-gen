    "intro": "Stigmatorhynchus, commonly known as the stigmatorhynchus plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which includes showy, often brightly colored bracts that serve to attract pollinators. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or pubescent. Its flowers are usually bisexual, with both stamens and pistils present, facilitating self-pollination in some species. Stigmatorhynchus is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates."
