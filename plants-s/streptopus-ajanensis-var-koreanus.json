    "intro": "Streptopus ajanensis var. koreanus, commonly known as the Korean starwort, is a rare and distinctive member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
