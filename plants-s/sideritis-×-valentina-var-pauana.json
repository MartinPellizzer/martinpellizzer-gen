    "intro": "Sideritis \u00d7 valentina var. pauana, commonly known as the pink mountain sedge, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is relatively rare and requires careful care to grow successfully."
