    "intro": "Spiladocorys angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spiladocorys, is a species of flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments. It is often found in humid forests and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory vegetation. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
