    "intro": "Saxifraga aquatica var. aprica, commonly known as the spring water saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, calcareous habitats. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adapting to its wet environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found near streams and wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable indicator species for aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
