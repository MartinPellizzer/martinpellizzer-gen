    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus subsp. maximowiczii, commonly known as the swamp reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soils, often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
