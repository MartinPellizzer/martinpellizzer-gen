It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
