    "intro": "Styrax rigidifolius f. yapobodensis, commonly known as the Yapobodense Styrax, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its unique floral structure and aromatic properties make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
