    "intro": "Stellaria rugegensis, commonly known as the mountain starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant produces small, white or pinkish star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Stellaria rugegensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
