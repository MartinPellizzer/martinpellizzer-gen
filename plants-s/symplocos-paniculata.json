    "intro": "Symplocos paniculata, commonly known as the Indian snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
