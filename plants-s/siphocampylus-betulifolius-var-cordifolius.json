    "intro": "Siphocampylus betulifolius var. cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
