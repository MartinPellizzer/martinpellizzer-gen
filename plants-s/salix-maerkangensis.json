    "intro": "Salix maerkangensis, commonly known as the Maerkang willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or ecological restoration projects."
