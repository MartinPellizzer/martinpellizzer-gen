    "intro": "Scilla pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered scilla, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
