    "intro": "Solidago praecox, commonly known as early goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Solidago praecox plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during its blooming season."
