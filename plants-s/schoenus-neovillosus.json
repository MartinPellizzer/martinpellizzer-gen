    "intro": "Schoenus neovillosus, commonly known as the silky bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and long, narrow leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus neovillosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
