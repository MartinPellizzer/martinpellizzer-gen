    "intro": "Selaginella wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Selaginella wrightii is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
