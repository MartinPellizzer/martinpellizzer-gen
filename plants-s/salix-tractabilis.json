    "intro": "Salix tractabilis, commonly known as the flexible willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. Salix tractabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
