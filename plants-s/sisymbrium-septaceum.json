    "intro": "Sisymbrium septaceum, commonly known as the common yellow rocket, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom from early spring to summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens."
