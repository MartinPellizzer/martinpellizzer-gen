    "intro": "Stachys littoralis, commonly known as seaside betony, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces spikes of violet or purple flowers in the summer, which are clustered in whorls along the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Stachys littoralis is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
