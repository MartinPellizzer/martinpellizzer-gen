    "intro": "Schinopsis balansae, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a species native to South America, particularly found in countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate with 5 to 11 leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Schinopsis balansae is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
