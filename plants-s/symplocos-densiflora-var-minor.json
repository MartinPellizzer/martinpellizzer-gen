    "intro": "Symplocos densiflora var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
