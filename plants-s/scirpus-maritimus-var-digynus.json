    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. digynus, commonly known as the sea club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland and salt marsh environments. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that aids in salt tolerance."
