It is native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia and Panama, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insect species. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation areas."
