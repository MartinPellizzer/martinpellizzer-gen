    "intro": "Solanum greviifolium, commonly known as the Grevillea leaf nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, and the plant thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally not cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
