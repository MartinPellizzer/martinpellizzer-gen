    "intro": "Scandix taurica, commonly known as the Crimean scurvygrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate and linear, with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Scandix taurica is noted for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
