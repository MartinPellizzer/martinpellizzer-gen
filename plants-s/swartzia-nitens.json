    "intro": "Swartzia nitens, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Swartzia nitens is also known for its ability to thrive in tropical climates and its role in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
