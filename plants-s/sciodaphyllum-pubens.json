    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum pubens, commonly known as the silver-haired fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the moist, shaded environments of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum pubens is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-quality ecosystems."
