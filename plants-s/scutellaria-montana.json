    "intro": "Scutellaria montana, commonly known as mountain blueflag, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Scutellaria montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
