    "intro": "Schizaea rupestris, commonly known as the rock hound fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Schizaeaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in such habitats. Schizaea rupestris is notable for its unique reproductive structures, which include sporangia that are clustered in specialized leaflets."
