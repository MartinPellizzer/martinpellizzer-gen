    "intro": "Stenotaphrum subulatum, commonly known as coarsestalk muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Stenotaphrum subulatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
