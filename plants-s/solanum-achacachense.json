    "intro": "Solanum achacachense, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, with a glandular texture that helps deter herbivores. The fruit is a small, green berry that ripens to a yellowish color, containing several seeds."
