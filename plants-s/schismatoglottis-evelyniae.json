    "intro": "Schismatoglottis evelyniae, commonly known as Evelyn's schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy sheen, and its delicate, orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal make it a sought-after species among plant enthusiasts and horticulturists. Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
