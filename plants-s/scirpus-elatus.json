    "intro": "Scirpus elatus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Scirpus elatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
