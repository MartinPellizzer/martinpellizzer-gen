    "intro": "Stelis rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping stelis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a faint fragrance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical structure includes strap-like leaves and a fibrous root system adapted for nutrient absorption in its natural habitat."
