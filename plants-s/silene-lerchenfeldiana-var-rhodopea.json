It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
