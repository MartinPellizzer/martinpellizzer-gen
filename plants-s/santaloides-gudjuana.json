    "intro": "Santaloides gudjuana, commonly known as the Gudjuana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical rainforests. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
