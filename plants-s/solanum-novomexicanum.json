    "intro": "Solanum novomexicanum, commonly known as the New Mexico nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, which bloom in the evening. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. Solanum novomexicanum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important crops and ornamental plants."
