    "intro": "Saxifraga laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga laevicaulis is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
