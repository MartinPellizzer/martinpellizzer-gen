    "intro": "Salvia perrieri subsp. brevilabiata, commonly known as the narrow-lipped sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
