    "intro": "Sorghum hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
