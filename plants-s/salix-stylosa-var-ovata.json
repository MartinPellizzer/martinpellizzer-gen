    "intro": "Salix stylosa var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
