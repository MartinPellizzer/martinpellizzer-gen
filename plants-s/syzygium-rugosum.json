    "intro": "Syzygium rugosum, commonly known as the rough-shelled apple or the Java apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its rough, bark-like fruit covering. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and arranged alternately along the branches. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
