    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in its often arid and rocky habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated plant collections."
