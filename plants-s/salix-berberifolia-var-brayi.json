    "intro": "Salix berberifolia var. brayi, commonly known as the bray's willow, is a rare variant of the yellow willow found primarily in specific regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves typically have a yellowish-green hue and are arranged alternately along the stems. This plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
