    "intro": "Scirpus candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that resemble a candlestick, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in muddy or wet soils. Scirpus candelabrum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
