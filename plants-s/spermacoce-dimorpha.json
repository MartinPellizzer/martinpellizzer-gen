    "intro": "Spermacoce dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form moonseed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive two-lobed, smooth-seeded fruits. Spermacoce dimorpha is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
