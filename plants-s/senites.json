    "intro": "Senites, commonly known as stonecrops, are succulent plants belonging to the family Crassulaceae. They are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Senites typically have a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or rosettes. Many species are found in rocky or gravelly soils, where they can tolerate poor nutrient conditions. Their ability to survive in harsh climates makes them popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
