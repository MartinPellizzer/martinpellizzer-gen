    "intro": "Salvinia \u00d7 delasotae, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salvinia molesta and Salvinia minima. It is a free-floating aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate can lead to ecological imbalances by outcompeting native species for light and nutrients. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic aquatic weed in many regions."
