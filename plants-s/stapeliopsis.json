    "intro": "Stapeliopsis, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a genus of succulent plants native to South Africa. These plants are characterized by their fleshy, often spiny leaves and their ability to store water, making them well adapted to arid environments. Many species produce striking, night-blooming flowers that resemble insects, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting moths and other nocturnal insects. Stapeliopsis plants are often grown as ornamental succulents due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require minimal watering to prevent root rot."
