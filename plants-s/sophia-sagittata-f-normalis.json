    "intro": "Sophia sagittata f. normalis, commonly known as the common arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive white or light green coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth makes it an effective indicator of water quality and a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
