    "intro": "Stanhopea naurayi, commonly known as the Nauru orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Nauru in the Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in its arid environment. Its flowers are borne on erect, slender stems and are often fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Stanhopea naurayi is considered critically endangered."
