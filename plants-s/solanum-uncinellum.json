    "intro": "Solanum uncinellum, commonly known as the hooked nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that mature to a deep purple color. Its leaves are ovate with hairy surfaces and have a distinct, somewhat unpleasant odor. Solanum uncinellum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
