    "intro": "Schima rigida, commonly known as the Chinese tea tree, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain two seeds each. Schima rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
