    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos asplenioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
