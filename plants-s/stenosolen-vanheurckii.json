    "intro": "Stenosolen vanheurckii, commonly known as the Vanheurck's narrow-leaved orchid, is a unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
