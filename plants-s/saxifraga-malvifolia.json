    "intro": "Saxifraga malvifolia, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga malvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
