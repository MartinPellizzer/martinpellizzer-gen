    "intro": "Schinziophyton rautanenii, commonly known as the Rautanen\u2019s cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk, and the plant is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils. Schinziophyton rautanenii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era."
