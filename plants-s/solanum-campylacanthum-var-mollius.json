    "intro": "Solanum campylacanthum var. mollius, commonly known as the broad-lobed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening. It produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
