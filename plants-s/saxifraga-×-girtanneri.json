    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 girtanneri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically succulent and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and other specialized garden settings."
