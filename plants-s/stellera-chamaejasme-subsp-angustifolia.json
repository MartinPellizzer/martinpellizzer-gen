    "intro": "Stellera chamaejasme subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
