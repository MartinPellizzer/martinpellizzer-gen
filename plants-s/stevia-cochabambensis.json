    "intro": "Stevia cochabambensis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Stevia cochabambensis is also valued for its low-calorie, non-nutritive sweet taste, making it a popular alternative to sugar."
