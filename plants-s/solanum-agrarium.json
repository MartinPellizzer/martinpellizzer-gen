    "intro": "Solanum agrarium, commonly known as the agrarian nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, though they are toxic and not edible. Solanum agrarium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
