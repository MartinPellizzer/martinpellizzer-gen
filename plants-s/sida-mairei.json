    "intro": "Sida mairei, commonly known as the Maire's mallows, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and the plant is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Sida mairei has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties in some island cultures."
