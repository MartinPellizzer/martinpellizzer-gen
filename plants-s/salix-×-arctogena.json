It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
