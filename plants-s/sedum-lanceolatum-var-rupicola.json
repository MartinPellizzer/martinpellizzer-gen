    "intro": "Sedum lanceolatum var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky habitats in North America. It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
