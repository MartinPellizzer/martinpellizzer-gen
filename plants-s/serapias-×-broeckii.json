    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 broeckii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid gentian, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Gentianaceae family. It is a hybrid between Serapias fritillariaeflora and Serapias micrantha, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with intricate patterns resembling those of orchids. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also rare in the wild."
