    "intro": "Scrophularia lyrata var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered heartwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species with medicinal and ornamental value. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
