    "intro": "Santalum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a species of tree native to eastern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. The tree has small, narrow leaves and produces fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and perfumes. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
