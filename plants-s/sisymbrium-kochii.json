    "intro": "Sisymbrium kochii, commonly known as the Koch's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem structure. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in dry, arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants."
