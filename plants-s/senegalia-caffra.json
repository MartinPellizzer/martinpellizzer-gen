    "intro": "Senegalia caffra, commonly known as the sour acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of local ecosystems. Senegalia caffra is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood."
