    "intro": "Schizachyrium compressum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit. It is a perennial plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that turn reddish-brown in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable for ecological restoration projects. Schizachyrium compressum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in native plant communities."
