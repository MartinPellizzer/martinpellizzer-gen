    "intro": "Sirmuellera prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sirmuellera, is a low-growing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
