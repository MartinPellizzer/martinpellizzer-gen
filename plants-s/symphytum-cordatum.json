    "intro": "Symphytum cordatum, commonly known as heartsease, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is known for its mucilage-rich stems, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Symphytum cordatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
