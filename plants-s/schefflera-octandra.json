    "intro": "Schefflera octandra, commonly known as the octopus tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like cluster of leaves at the ends of its branches, which gives it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a radial pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas. Schefflera octandra is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements."
