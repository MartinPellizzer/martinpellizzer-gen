    "intro": "Scirpus angachillensis, commonly known as the Angachill sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Scirpus angachillensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
