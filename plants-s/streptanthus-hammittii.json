    "intro": "Streptanthus hammittii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and slopes, in California and Nevada. It has a low-growing habit with basal leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
