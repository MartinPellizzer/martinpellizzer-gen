    "intro": "Salix fluviatilis var. sericans, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically silvery-white beneath. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, often wet soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its distinctive appearance and ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
