    "intro": "Silene syngei, commonly known as the Seward's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Silene syngei is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
