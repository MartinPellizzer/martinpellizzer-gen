It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme altitudes and cold climates. Its fibrous roots and hardy nature make it well-suited for harsh mountainous conditions.
