    "intro": "Serapias lingua f. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
