It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
