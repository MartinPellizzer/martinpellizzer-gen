    "intro": "Salix toumeyi, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is an important species in alpine ecosystems."
