    "intro": "Streptocarpus dolichanthus, commonly known as the long-flowered streptocarpus, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native environment. It produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Streptocarpus dolichanthus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
