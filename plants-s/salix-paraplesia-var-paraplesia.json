    "intro": "Salix paraplesia var. paraplesia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The plant produces catkins, which are the male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. The leaves are generally smooth on both surfaces and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal ecological role."
