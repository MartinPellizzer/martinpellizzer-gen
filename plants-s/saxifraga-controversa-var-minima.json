    "intro": "Saxifraga controversa var. minima, commonly known as the miniature saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. This variety is prized in horticulture for its compact size and ability to thrive in rock gardens and alpine settings."
