It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving it a graceful and ornamental look. The leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, or wetlands. This species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to stabilize soil along waterways."
