    "intro": "Swartzia maquenqueana, commonly known as the Maquenquean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
