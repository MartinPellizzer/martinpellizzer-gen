    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subvar. leucantha, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
