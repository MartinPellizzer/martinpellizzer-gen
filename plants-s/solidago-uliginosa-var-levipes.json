    "intro": "Solidago uliginosa var. levipes, commonly known as the swamp goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright, branched stems that often grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of many tiny disk flowers surrounded by petal-like bracts. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to moist, acidic soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
