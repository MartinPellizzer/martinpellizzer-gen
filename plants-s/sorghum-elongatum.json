    "intro": "Sorghum elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sorghum, is a grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains, which are typically harvested for food or feed. It thrives in warm climates and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid regions. Its botanical structure supports its role in both agricultural and ecological systems."
