    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella smithii var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, triangular spikelets are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to wet environments, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
