    "intro": "Saxifraga milesii, commonly known as the Yunnan saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette-forming foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
