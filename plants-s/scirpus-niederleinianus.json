    "intro": "Scirpus niederleinianus, commonly known as the Niederlein's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to wetland habitats in North America, particularly in the central and eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense clusters of spikelets at the top. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense stands in moist soils. Scirpus niederleinianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
