    "intro": "Salix repens var. elatior, commonly known as the tall willow or creeping willow, is a variant of the willow species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, appearing in early spring. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge, and they are usually covered in a fine layer of down. This variant is well adapted to moist environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil along waterways."
