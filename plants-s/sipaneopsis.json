    "intro": "Sipaneopsis, commonly known as the flame violet, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic or terrestrial herb, with fleshy, hairy leaves that aid in water retention. Sipaneopsis species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in shaded gardens and greenhouses. Due to habitat loss, several species are threatened with extinction, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
