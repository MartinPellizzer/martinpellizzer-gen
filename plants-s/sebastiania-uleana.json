    "intro": "Sebastiania uleana, commonly known as the red maple or Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish when young. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. Sebastiania uleana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal regions and lowland forests."
