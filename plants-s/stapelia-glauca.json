    "intro": "Stapelia glauca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like structure and its striking, waxy flowers that resemble dead animals, a feature evolved to attract specific pollinators. The plant produces pale green or yellowish flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Stapelia glauca is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
