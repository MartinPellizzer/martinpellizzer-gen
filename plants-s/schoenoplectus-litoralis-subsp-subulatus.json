    "intro": "Schoenoplectus litoralis subsp. subulatus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowering spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of tidal marsh ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, preventing erosion in vulnerable coastal areas. The subspecies subulatus is distinguished by its sharply pointed, needle-like leaves, which help it thrive in saline environments."
