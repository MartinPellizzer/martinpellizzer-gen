    "intro": "Sonchus cervicornis, commonly known as the crowned lettuce or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a tall, branching stem that bears yellow flowers. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, but it has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Sonchus cervicornis is an annual herb that produces numerous seeds, contributing to its invasive potential in some environments."
