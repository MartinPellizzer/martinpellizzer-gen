    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum subsp. heterophyllum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
