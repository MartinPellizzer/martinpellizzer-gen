    "intro": "Sphingium canescens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Sphingium canescens is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
