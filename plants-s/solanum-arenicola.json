    "intro": "Solanum arenicola, commonly known as the sand tomato, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant has a shallow root system that helps it conserve moisture. Solanum arenicola is part of the nightshade family and contains alkaloids, making it potentially toxic if ingested in large quantities."
