    "intro": "Stelis pachoi, commonly known as the Hawaiian lady's slipper, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy roots. The plant produces showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
