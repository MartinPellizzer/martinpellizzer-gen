    "intro": "Stipa niduloides, commonly known as the bentgrass or nodding grass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its flowering stems. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa niduloides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing turf."
