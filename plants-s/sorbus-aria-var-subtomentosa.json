    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance, particularly on younger shoots. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, spherical berries that are a food source for birds. This species is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
