This variant is a less common cultivar of rye, characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and robust growth habit. It is typically found in cooler climates and is often used in agricultural settings for its hardy nature. The plant has a compact stature with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
