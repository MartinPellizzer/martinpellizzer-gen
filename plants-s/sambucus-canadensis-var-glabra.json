It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible when ripe but contain small seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
