It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with numerous small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis dactyloptera thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect light for optimal growth."
