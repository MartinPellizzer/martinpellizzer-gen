    "intro": "Statice annulata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Statice annulata is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its resilience to coastal conditions."
