    "intro": "Seriphidium aralense, commonly known as the Aral Sea wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils along the edges of the Aral Sea. The plant features a low-growing, branching structure with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in dense, spherical clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Seriphidium aralense is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and is often used in traditional medicine in the region."
