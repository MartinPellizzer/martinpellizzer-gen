    "intro": "Stelis calceolus, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a dense cluster of small, hood-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often white or pale yellow, with a distinctive hooded structure that shelters the reproductive parts. Stelis calceolus requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive."
