    "intro": "Succisa prativaga, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along paths. Its succulent leaves allow it to store water, making it drought-tolerant once established."
