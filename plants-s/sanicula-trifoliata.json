    "intro": "Sanicula trifoliata, commonly known as three-leaved sanicle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features a basal rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Sanicula trifoliata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
