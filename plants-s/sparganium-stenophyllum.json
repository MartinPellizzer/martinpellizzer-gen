    "intro": "Sparganium stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spiky flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with seeds enclosed in fibrous, bur-like casings. Sparganium stenophyllum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
