    "intro": "Selliguea hovenkampiana, commonly known as the Hovenkamp's spikemoss, is a rare and specialized member of the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. The plant has a distinct structure with a short, upright stem and a rosette of linear, needle-like leaves. Its sporophyte stage is particularly notable for its elongated, spore-bearing structures called strobila. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
