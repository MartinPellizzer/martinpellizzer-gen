    "intro": "Santolina muricata, commonly known as silver santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and silvery-gray foliage that is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Santolina muricata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental appearance make it both a useful herb and an attractive landscape plant."
