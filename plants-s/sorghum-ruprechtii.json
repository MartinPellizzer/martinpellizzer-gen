    "intro": "Sorghum ruprechtii, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
