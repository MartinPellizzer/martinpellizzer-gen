    "intro": "Strychnos ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf strychnos, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its simple, opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it notable in ecological and medicinal contexts, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
