    "intro": "Selaginella ascillifolia, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats or clumps, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a fern-like appearance. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are usually located at the base of the plant. Selaginella ascillifolia is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
