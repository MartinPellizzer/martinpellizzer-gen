    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the sediment. It produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
