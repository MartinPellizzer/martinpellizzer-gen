    "intro": "Solanum jamesii, commonly known as the James' nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are often used by wildlife as a food source. Solanum jamesii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
