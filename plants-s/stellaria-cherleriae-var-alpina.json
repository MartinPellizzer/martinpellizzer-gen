    "intro": "Stellaria cherleriae var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has delicate, hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
