It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves and stems, which set it apart from other varieties of Silene nutans. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is a common sight in meadows during the summer months."
