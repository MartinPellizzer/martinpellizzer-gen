    "intro": "Salvia pratensis subsp. bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a soft, hairy texture, and are arranged oppositely along the stem. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
