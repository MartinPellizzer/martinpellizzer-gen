    "intro": "Selliguea werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a layer of water. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Selliguea werneri plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
