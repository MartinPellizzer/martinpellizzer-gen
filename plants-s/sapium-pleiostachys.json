    "intro": "Sapium pleiostachys, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in panicles, followed by woody, three-angled fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions. The species has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States, where it is sometimes considered a weed."
