    "intro": "Salix holosericea proles stipularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. This species is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils."
