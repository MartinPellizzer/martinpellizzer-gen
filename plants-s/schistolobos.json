    "intro": "Schistolobos, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal in sunlight. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Schistolobos thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is protected in its native region."
