    "intro": "Sedum indicum, commonly known as the Indian sedum, is a succulent plant native to parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum indicum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
