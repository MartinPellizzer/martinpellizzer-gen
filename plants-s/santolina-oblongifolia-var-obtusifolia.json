    "intro": "Santolina oblongifolia var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the obtuseleaf santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with oval, leathery leaves that are slightly rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice in xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens."
