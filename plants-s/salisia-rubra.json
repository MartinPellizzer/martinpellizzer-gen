    "intro": "Salisia rubra, commonly known as the red salix, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive red-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
