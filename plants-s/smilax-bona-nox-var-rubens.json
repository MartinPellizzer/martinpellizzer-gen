    "intro": "Smilax bona-nox var. rubens, commonly known as red-tailed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem with thorns and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red berries. The plant is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It is a dioecious species, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The berries are edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities."
