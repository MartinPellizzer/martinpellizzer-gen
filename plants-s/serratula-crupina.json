    "intro": "Serratula crupina, commonly known as the rock serratula, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in dry, sunny environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are serrated along the edges. Its flowering stems bear yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Serratula crupina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
