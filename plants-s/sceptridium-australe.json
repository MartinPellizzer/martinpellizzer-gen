    "intro": "Sceptridium australe, commonly known as the Southern Sceptridium, is a rare and unique fern native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often twisted fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
