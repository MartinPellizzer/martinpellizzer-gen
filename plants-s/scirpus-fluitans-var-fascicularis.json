    "intro": "Scirpus fluitans var. fascicularis, commonly known as the floating club-rush, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
