It features broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
