    "intro": "Salicornia alpini subsp. alpini, commonly known as marsh glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and alkaline environments. It is a succulent species with jointed, fleshy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other wetlands with high salinity. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of ecological succession in such habitats."
