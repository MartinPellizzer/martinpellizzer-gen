    "intro": "Schuechia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring. Schuechia species typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
