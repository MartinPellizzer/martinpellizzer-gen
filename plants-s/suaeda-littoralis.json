    "intro": "Suaeda littoralis, commonly known as sea sandmat, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and dunes, where it tolerates high salinity and arid conditions. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its small, green or yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Suaeda littoralis plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
