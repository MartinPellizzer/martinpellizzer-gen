    "intro": "Stipa macroglossa var. kazachstanica, commonly known as the Kazakh feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically pink or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and steppe environments. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger inflorescences compared to the typical form of S. macroglossa."
