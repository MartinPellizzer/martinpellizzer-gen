    "intro": "Scirpus cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which develop into dark, woody seeds. Scirpus cuspidatus thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
