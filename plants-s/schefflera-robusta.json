    "intro": "Schefflera robusta, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive, umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Schefflera robusta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
