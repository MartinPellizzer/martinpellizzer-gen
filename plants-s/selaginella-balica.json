    "intro": "Selaginella balica, commonly known as the Himalayan spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella balica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its adaptability to extreme environmental conditions."
