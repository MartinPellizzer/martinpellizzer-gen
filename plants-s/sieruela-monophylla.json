    "intro": "Sieruela monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf sieruela, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its singular, leathery leaf that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
