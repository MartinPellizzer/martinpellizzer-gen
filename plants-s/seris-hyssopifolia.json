    "intro": "Seris hyssopifolia, commonly known as the Mexican heather, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Seris hyssopifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
