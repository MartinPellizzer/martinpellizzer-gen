    "intro": "Submatucana paucicostata, commonly known as the slender-ribbed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sparse, pale spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil quickly. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in dry environments."
