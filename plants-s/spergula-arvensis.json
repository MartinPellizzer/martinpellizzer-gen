    "intro": "Spergula arvensis, commonly known as field mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual or biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces numerous tiny white or pinkish flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Spergula arvensis is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields, where it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils."
