    "intro": "Scilla angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf scilla, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are evergreen, providing a basal rosette structure. Scilla angusta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
