It is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils typical of mountainous environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Stylites andicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
