    "intro": "Sciaphila versteegiana, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, adapting to low-light conditions. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it often grows in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, Sciaphila versteegiana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
