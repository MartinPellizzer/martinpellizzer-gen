    "intro": "Stereochlaena caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It forms dense, low-growing clumps with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in moist, acidic soils. The plant has feather-like, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Stereochlaena caespitosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
