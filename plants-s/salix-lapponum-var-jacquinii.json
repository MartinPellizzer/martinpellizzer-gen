    "intro": "Salix lapponum var. jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its role in early season pollination. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats. Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
