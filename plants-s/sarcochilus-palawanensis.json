    "intro": "Sarcochilus palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan stone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
