    "intro": "Soldanella montana var. repanda, commonly known as the mountain soldanella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
