    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea f. platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled serapias, is a rare and striking hybrid plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, flat-topped inflorescence. The flowers are typically yellow with dark markings, and the plant has hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
