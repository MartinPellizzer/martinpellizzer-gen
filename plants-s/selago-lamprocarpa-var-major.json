    "intro": "Selago lamprocarpa var. major, commonly known as the giant sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense, mat-like formations. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its larger size compared to other varieties of Selago lamprocarpa."
