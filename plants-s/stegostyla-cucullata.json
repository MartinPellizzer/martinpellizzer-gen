    "intro": "Stegostyla cucullata, commonly known as the hooded sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters. It has a distinctive, rounded oral disc surrounded by long, flexible tentacles used for capturing prey. The plant-like structure of the anemone is actually a colony of polyps, which are connected by a shared gastrovascular cavity. Its coloration can vary, often appearing in shades of pink, red, or orange, depending on the environment. Stegostyla cucullata plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to biodiversity."
