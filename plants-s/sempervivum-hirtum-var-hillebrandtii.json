It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces upright stems with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in garden settings."
