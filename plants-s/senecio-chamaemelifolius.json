    "intro": "Senecio chamaemelifolius, commonly known as the rock rose or rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
