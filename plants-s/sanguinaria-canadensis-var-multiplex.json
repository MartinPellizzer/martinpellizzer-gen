    "intro": "Sanguinaria canadensis var. multiplex, commonly known as the red puccoon, is a variant of the bloodroot plant native to eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its distinctive red-orange sap, which is toxic and has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. The plant features a single, palmately lobed leaf and a single, white, bell-shaped flower that blooms in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, woodland soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
