    "intro": "Sambucus plumosa laciniata, commonly known as the lace-leaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely cut, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Sambucus plumosa laciniata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
