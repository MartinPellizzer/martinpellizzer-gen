    "intro": "Swartzia fimbriata, commonly known as the velvetwood or fimbriate swartzia, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The tree is notable for its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain the seeds. Swartzia fimbriata is often found in humid lowland forests and is used in both traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
