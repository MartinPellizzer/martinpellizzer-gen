    "intro": "Sophora chrysophylla var. unifoliata, commonly known as the golden-leaf sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking yellow foliage, which turns golden in the autumn, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique leaf coloration, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
