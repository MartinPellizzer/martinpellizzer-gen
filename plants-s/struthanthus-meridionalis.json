    "intro": "Struthanthus meridionalis, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters, featuring woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Struthanthus meridionalis is well-suited to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
