    "intro": "Scirpus lineatus subsp. concolor, commonly known as the smooth bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands along the edges of ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are linear and often have a smooth, glossy surface, which distinguishes it from other bulrush species. Scirpus lineatus subsp. concolor plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
