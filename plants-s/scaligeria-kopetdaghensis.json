    "intro": "Scaligeria kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdagh scaleria, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
