    "intro": "Stevia tomentosa, commonly known as woolly stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is related to the sweetleaf plant, Stevia rebaudiana, but differs in its appearance and chemical composition. Stevia tomentosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
