    "intro": "Saxifraga meridionalis var. latina, commonly known as the Mediterranean saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features dark green, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in early summer, usually in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is valued in rock gardens for its ornamental appeal."
