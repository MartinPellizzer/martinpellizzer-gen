    "intro": "Sonchus uliginosus, commonly known as swamp groundsel, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It has heart-shaped, toothed leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Swamp groundsel is often considered a pioneer species in disturbed wetland environments."
