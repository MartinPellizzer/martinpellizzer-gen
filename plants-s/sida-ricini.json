    "intro": "Sida ricini, commonly known as castor bean, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds used in the production of castor oil. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
