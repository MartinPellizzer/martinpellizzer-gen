    "intro": "Schizoloma agatii, commonly known as the ghost fungi, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with a pale, translucent cap that often appears to be in a state of decay. The fruiting bodies typically grow in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in moist, temperate forests. Its spore-bearing surface is smooth and often has a slight sheen, contributing to its eerie appearance. Schizoloma agatii is notable for its bioluminescent properties, which make it glow faintly in the dark."
