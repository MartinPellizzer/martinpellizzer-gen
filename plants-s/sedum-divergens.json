It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch out horizontally, giving it a distinctive, sprawling appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Sedum divergens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
