    "intro": "Schottariella, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. Schottariella species typically have a short stem and rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that help store water. They produce small, tubular flowers that are usually clustered in a spike at the top of the plant. The genus is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation indoors."
