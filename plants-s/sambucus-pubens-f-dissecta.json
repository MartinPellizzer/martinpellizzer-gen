    "intro": "Sambucus pubens f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected elderberry, is a botanical variant of the elderberry plant. It is characterized by its finely dissected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist, woodland environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
