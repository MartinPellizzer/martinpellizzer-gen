    "intro": "Schistophragma pusillum var. major, commonly known as the giant stonecrop, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a succulent perennial characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
