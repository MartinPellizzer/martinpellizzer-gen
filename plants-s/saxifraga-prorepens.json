    "intro": "Saxifraga prorepens, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous environments. Saxifraga prorepens is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
