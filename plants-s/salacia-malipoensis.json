    "intro": "Salacia malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other members of the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
