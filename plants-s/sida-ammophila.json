    "intro": "Sida ammophila, commonly known as beach sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to withstand wind and salt spray. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed coastal soils. Sida ammophila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
