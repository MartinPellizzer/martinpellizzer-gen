    "intro": "Schoenoplectus monophyllus subsp. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, leaf-like stems that form a thick mat on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for wildlife."
