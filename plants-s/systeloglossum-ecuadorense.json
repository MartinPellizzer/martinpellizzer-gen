    "intro": "Systeloglossum ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in humid and shaded conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
