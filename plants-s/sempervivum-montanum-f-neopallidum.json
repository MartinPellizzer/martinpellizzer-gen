    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum f. neopallidum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often persisting through harsh winters."
