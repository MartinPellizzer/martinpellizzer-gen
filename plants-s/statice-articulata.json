    "intro": "Statice articulata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice articulata is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
