    "intro": "Schoberia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, creeping stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Schoberia prostrata is well-suited for rock gardens and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
