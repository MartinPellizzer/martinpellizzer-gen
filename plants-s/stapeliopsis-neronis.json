    "intro": "Stapeliopsis neronis, commonly known as the Neroni's stapeliopsis, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 cm. The plant produces striking, fleshy, red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, resembling those of its relative, Stapelia. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
