    "intro": "Sonchus maritimus subsp. aquatilis, commonly known as water sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and wet environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in brackish or freshwater habitats, often found in marshes, estuaries, and along shorelines. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural settings."
