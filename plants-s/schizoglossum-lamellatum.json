    "intro": "Schizoglossum lamellatum, commonly known as the fluted or pleated plant, is a unique member of the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated, and often wavy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Schizoglossum lamellatum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
