    "intro": "Solanum hasslerianum var. horridum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough, sometimes prickly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its toxic compounds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
