    "intro": "Stellaria viscosa, commonly known as sticky willow or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy, sticky stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, while its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Stellaria viscosa is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
