    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. sebastianum, commonly known as the Sebastian potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including smaller tubers and a more compact growth habit compared to typical potato varieties. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same genus as the common potato. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for food due to its distinct appearance. This variety is often used in horticultural settings to add visual interest to gardens."
