    "intro": "Syngonanthus hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for construction and tool-making. Syngonanthus hondurensis typically grows in lowland tropical forests and is adapted to humid, warm climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
