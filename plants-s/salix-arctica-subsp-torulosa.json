    "intro": "Salix arctica subsp. torulosa, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing form and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is an important component of tundra ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various arctic wildlife."
