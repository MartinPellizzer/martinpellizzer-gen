    "intro": "Senecio tetranthus, commonly known as the four-rayed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Senecio tetranthus is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
