    "intro": "Spiraea virginiana f. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated meadow spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
