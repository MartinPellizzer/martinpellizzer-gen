It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This subspecies is adapted to moist environments and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones."
