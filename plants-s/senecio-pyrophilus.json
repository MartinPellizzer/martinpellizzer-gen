    "intro": "Senecio pyrophilus, commonly known as the fireweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to fire-prone environments, which is reflected in its common name. It has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio pyrophilus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is a hardy species that thrives in full sun."
