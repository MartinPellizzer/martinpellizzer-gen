    "intro": "Schizachyrium exile, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and dry woodlands. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Schizachyrium exile is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
