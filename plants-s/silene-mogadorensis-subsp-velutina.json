    "intro": "Silene mogadorensis subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
