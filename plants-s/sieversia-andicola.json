    "intro": "Sieversia andicola, commonly known as the Andean sievegrass, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are often borne on short pedicels. Sieversia andicola is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the Andean flora, though it is relatively obscure in horticultural cultivation."
