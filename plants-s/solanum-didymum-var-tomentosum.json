    "intro": "Solanum didymum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
