It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant has succulent leaves that store water, and its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal and desert soils due to its extensive root system. Suaeda sibirica is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation of saline environments."
