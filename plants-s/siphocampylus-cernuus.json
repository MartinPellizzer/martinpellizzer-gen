It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native or exotic plants."
