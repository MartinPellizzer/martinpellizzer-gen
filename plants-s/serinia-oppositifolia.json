    "intro": "Serinia oppositifolia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, leathery leaves that are oppositely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its woody, hardy stems make it highly drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Serinia oppositifolia is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber in certain regions."
