    "intro": "Santolina africana, commonly known as African santolina, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
