    "intro": "Solori pseudinvoluta, commonly known as the false spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its helical growth pattern, which allows it to wrap around supports. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
