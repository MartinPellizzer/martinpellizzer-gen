    "intro": "Stemodiacra durantifolia, commonly known as the everlasting stemodia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is perennial, meaning it can live for multiple years, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
