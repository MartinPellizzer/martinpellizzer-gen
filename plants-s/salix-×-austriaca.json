    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its graceful, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, making it a popular ornamental tree. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is widely cultivated in gardens and parks."
