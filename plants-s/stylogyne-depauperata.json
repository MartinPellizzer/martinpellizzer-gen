    "intro": "Stylogyne depauperata, commonly known as the poorflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along streambanks. Its flowers are small and white, with a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Stylogyne depauperata is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological requirements."
