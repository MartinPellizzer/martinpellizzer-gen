    "intro": "Salvia heterofolia, commonly known as the variable sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Salvia heterofolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
