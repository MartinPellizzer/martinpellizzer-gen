It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Serratula. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Serratula corymbosa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides."
