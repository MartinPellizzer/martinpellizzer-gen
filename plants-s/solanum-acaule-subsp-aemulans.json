It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a bright red or yellow color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its attractive appearance and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
