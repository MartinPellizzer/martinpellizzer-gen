It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
