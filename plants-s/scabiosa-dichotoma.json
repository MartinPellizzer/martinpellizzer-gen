    "intro": "Scabiosa dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Scabiosa dichotoma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
