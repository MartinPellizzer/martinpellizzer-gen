    "intro": "Sonchus plumerii, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces a tall, branching stem with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an aggressive weed in agricultural settings."
