It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. Senecio fallax is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its use in traditional medicine."
