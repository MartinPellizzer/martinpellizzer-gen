It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive yellow and green petals. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and meadows. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
