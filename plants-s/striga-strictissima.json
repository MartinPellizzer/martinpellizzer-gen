    "intro": "Striga strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is considered an agricultural weed due to its ability to reduce crop yields. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host plants, making it a challenging weed to control in agricultural settings."
