    "intro": "Saxifraga cognata, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Saxifraga cognata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its habitat."
