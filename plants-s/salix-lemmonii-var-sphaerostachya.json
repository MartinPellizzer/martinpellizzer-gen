    "intro": "Salix lemmonii var. sphaerostachya, commonly known as the Lemmon's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically grayish-green on the upper surface. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical or oval-shaped inflorescences, giving it its specific epithet *sphaerostachya*. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin, papery layers. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions."
