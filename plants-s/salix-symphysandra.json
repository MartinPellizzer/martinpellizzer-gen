    "intro": "Salix symphysandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Salix symphysandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
