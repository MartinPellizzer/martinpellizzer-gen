    "intro": "Spodiopogon scrobiculatus, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag arrangement of the leaf sheaths, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as marshes and wetlands, thriving in humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that contributes to its resilience in wet conditions. Spodiopogon scrobiculatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
