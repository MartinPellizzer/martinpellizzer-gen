    "intro": "Sinningia macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-leaf gloxinia, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sinningia macrorhiza is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
