    "intro": "Salix nitida, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of the Americas and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, woody capsules containing seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive near water sources."
