    "intro": "Sagina schiraevskii, commonly known as the mountain sagina, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, succulent leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces tiny white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
