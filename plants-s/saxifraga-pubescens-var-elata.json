    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. elata, commonly known as the tall hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming growth with hairy, ovate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
