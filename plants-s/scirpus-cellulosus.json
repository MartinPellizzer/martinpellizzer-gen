    "intro": "Scirpus cellulosus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, brownish flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus cellulosus is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife."
