    "intro": "Salix smithiana proles capreiformis, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
