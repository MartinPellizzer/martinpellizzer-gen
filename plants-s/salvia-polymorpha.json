    "intro": "Salvia polymorpha, commonly known as the Mexican mint marigold, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic, fuzzy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Salvia polymorpha is also valued as a nectar source for bees and other pollinators."
