    "intro": "Sonchus frondosus, commonly known as the fronded sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can be invasive in some regions. Its leaves are edible when young, though they become bitter with age, and the plant is often considered a weed. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into hairy, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
