It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Schizobasis sigmoidea is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its name refers to the zigzag pattern of its stem, which is a distinctive botanical feature."
