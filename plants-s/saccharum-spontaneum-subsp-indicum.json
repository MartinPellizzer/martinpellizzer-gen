It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. It plays an important role in ecological systems as a source of forage for livestock and as a potential raw material for biofuel production. Additionally, it is considered a wild relative of cultivated sugarcane, offering genetic diversity for breeding programs."
