    "intro": "Solanum simile var. typicum, commonly known as the typical similar nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is native to certain regions of South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
