    "intro": "Sedum reflexum subsp. montanum, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid environments."
