    "intro": "Serjania lupulina var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf serjania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
