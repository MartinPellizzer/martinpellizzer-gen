    "intro": "Saussurea koslowi, commonly known as the Tibetan yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, composite flowers arranged in a single head, with pale yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
