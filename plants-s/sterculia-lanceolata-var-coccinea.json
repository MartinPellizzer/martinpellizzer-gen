    "intro": "Sterculia lanceolata var. coccinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed sterculia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and distinctive red stems, which are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
