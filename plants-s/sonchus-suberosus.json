    "intro": "Sonchus suberosus, commonly known as the woolly beggarweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
