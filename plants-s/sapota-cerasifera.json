    "intro": "Sapota cerasifera, commonly known as the chikoo or chico, is a tropical tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces a distinctive fruit with a thick, inedible rind and a soft, sweet pulp containing large, starchy seeds. The fruit is rich in nutrients, including potassium, magnesium, and dietary fiber. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
