    "intro": "Strobilanthes accrescens, commonly known as the \"Everlasting\" or \"Ceylon flame flower,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an herb or small shrub, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Strobilanthes accrescens is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a resilient species in tropical regions."
