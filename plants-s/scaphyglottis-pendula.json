    "intro": "Scaphyglottis pendula, commonly known as the hanging bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Scaphyglottis pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
