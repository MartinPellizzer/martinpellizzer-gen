    "intro": "Sorbus sitchensis var. densa, commonly known as the dense rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as coniferous forests. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
