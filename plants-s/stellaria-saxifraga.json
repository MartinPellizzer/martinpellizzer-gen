    "intro": "Stellaria saxifraga, commonly known as the rockstar starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is known for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats. Stellaria saxifraga is also noted for its delicate appearance, with a compact growth habit and a subtle, almost ethereal presence in its natural setting."
