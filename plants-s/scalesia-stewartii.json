    "intro": "Scalesia stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's scaleia, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often forming a striking contrast with its dark, waxy leaves. The plant is adapted to the unique volcanic soil and climate of the Gal\u00e1pagos, exhibiting specialized growth patterns. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
