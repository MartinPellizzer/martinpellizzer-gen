    "intro": "Selaginella leptoblepharis, commonly known as the slender-scaled spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a distinctive waxy coating. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are borne on the upper part of the plant, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Selaginella leptoblepharis is valued for its adaptability and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience."
