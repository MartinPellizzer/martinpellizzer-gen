    "intro": "Sterculia gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant sterculia, is a large, evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The tree produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
