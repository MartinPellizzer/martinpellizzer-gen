    "intro": "Sicyocarya umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella sicyocarya, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, umbellate inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, and its flowers are typically small and pale in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist woodlands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
