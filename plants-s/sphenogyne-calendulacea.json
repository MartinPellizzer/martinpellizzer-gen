    "intro": "Sphenogyne calendulacea, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often near the edges of ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged environments. Sphenogyne calendulacea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
