    "intro": "Soldanella crenata, commonly known as the crested snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Soldanella crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
