    "intro": "Scirpus camptotrichus, commonly known as the bulrush, is a tall, emergent aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense stands, and its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly ribbed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Scirpus camptotrichus plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. It is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
