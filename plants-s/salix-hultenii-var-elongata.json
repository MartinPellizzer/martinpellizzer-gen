    "intro": "Salix hultenii var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas or wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing stream banks."
