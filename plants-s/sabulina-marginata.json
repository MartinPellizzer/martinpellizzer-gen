    "intro": "Sabulina marginata, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pink and appear in clusters, adding a delicate touch to the landscape. Sabulina marginata plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
