The tree is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. Sycopsis formosana is valued for its ecological role and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
