It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Sinarundinaria chingii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens and shaded areas."
