    "intro": "Stelis saurota, commonly known as the saurota orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically has slender, branching stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis saurota is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
