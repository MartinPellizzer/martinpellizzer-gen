    "intro": "Syngonium ternatum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that vary in color from solid green to variegated patterns of white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Syngonium ternatum is also valued for its ability to purify indoor air and its adaptability to various light conditions."
