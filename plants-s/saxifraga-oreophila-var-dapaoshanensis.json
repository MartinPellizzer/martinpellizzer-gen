    "intro": "Saxifraga oreophila var. dapaoshanensis, commonly known as the Dapashan saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the Dapashan mountain range in China. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to cold and humid environments, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
