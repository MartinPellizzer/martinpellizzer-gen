    "intro": "Salix pentandra f. pubipetiolata, commonly known as the pubescent petioled willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves with a hairy underside. The leaves are typically alternate and have a pointed tip, while the plant produces catkins that are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, often windy environments and is adapted to cold climates. This willow variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal and tundra soils."
