    "intro": "Spodiopogon zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along water bodies. Spodiopogon zeylanicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
