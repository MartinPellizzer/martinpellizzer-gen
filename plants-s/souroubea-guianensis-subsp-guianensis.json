    "intro": "Souroubea guianensis subsp. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan souroubea, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. The species is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its timber and medicinal properties."
