It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions."
