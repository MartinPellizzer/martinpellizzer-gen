    "intro": "Salvadora persica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent, and it produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, date-like fruits. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, with parts of the plant used in traditional remedies. The wood is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and tool-making in its native habitats."
