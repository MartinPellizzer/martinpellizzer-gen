    "intro": "Salix indefinita, commonly known as the western willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian zones. Salix indefinita plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
