    "intro": "Sedum triangulosepalum, commonly known as the triangular-sepaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, triangular-shaped leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by succulent enthusiasts."
