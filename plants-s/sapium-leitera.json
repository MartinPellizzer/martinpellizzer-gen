    "intro": "Sapium leitera, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
