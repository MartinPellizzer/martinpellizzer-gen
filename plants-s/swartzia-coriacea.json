    "intro": "Swartzia coriacea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, and it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
