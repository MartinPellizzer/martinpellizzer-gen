    "intro": "Salix angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix angusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
