    "intro": "Senecio cristobalensis, commonly known as the cristobalensis groundsels, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Senecio cristobalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
