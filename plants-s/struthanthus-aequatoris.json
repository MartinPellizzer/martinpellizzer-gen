    "intro": "Struthanthus aequatoris, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Struthanthus aequatoris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
