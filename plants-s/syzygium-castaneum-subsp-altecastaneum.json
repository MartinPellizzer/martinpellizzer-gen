It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
