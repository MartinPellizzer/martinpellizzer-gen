    "intro": "Sagittaria radicans, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a water-loving perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or rise above it, with roots submerged in the aquatic environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge on slender stalks above the water, adding a delicate floral display. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sagittaria radicans is also valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in both freshwater and brackish conditions."
