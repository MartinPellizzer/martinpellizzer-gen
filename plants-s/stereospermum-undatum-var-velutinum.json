    "intro": "Stereospermum undatum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often velvety bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a tangy, acidic flavor, while the seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its fruit in traditional cuisine and medicine."
