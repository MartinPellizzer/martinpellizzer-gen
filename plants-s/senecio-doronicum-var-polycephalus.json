It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
