    "intro": "Schmaltzia choriophylla, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. Schmaltzia choriophylla typically grows low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its harsh environment. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
