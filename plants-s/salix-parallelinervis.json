    "intro": "Salix parallelinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with prominent parallel veins. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
