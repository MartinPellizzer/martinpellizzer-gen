    "intro": "Scirpus quinqueflorus, commonly known as the five-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikes at the top of the stem. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and contributes to wetland ecosystem health. Scirpus quinqueflorus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
