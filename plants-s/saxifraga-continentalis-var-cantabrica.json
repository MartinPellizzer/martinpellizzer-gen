    "intro": "Saxifraga continentalis var. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant features fleshy, basal leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps it retain moisture. This variety is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
