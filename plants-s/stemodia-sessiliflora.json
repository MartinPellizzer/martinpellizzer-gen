It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, arranged in terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
