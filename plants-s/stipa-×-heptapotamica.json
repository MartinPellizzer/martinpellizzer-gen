    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 heptapotamica, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Stipa capillata and Stipa robusta. It typically grows in temperate climates and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that are usually panicle-like, with small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
