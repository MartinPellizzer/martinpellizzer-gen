    "intro": "Scandix borziana, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Scandix borziana is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is an important species in high-altitude ecosystems."
