    "intro": "Stellaria serpens, commonly known as the snake's head sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping stem that often forms dense mats, with small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, giving it a delicate, star-like appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Stellaria serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
