    "intro": "Sesbania simpliciuscula var. simpliciuscula, commonly known as the small-seeded sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing numerous small, oblong seeds. It has a deep root system that enables it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability."
