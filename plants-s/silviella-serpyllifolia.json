    "intro": "Silviella serpyllifolia, commonly known as field scurvy grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish or white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Silviella serpyllifolia is known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat scurvy due to its high vitamin C content."
