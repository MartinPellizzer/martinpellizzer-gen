    "intro": "Schoenus triticoides, commonly known as the false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Schoenus triticoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
