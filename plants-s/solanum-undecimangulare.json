    "intro": "Solanum undecimangulare, commonly known as the eleven-angled nightshade, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, angular stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
