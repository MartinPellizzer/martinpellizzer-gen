    "intro": "Swintonia lurida, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Swintonia lurida is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh, dry environments."
