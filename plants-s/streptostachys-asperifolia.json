    "intro": "Streptostachys asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved streptostachys, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, typically arranged in inflorescences. Its fibrous roots and woody stems contribute to its structural resilience. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
