    "intro": "Saurauia altissima, commonly known as the giant saurauia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a popular species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
