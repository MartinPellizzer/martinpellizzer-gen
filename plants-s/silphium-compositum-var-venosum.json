    "intro": "Silphium compositum var. venosum, commonly known as the veined compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the tallgrass prairies of North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. Silphium compositum var. venosum is valued for its ecological importance and historical use by Native American tribes."
