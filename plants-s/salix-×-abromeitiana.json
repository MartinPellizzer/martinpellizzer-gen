    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 abromeitiana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis and Salix schwerinii, characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in wet or moist environments, often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
