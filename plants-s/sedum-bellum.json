It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum bellum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
