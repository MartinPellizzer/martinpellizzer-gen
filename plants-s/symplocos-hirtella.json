    "intro": "Symplocos hirtella, commonly known as hairy wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Symplocos hirtella thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory in humid, forested environments."
