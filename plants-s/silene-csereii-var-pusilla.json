    "intro": "Silene csereii var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene csereii var. pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
