It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-red foliage, which stands out against the greenery of its habitat. Its flowers, which are tubular and often reddish or orange, are borne in clusters and attract various pollinators.
