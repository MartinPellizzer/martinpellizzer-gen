    "intro": "Saurauia tomentosa var. chillaneana, commonly known as the Chillanean wooly mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, showy pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
