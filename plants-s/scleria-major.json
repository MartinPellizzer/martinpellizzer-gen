    "intro": "Scleria major, commonly known as the broadleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features a robust rhizomatous root system and produces tall, triangular stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, three-lobed flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Scleria major is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
