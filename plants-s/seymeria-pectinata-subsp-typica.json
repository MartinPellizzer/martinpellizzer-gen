    "intro": "Seymeria pectinata subsp. typica, commonly known as the typical Seymeria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The subspecies typica is distinguished by its specific morphological traits, including the structure of its inflorescence and leaf venation."
