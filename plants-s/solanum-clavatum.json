    "intro": "Solanum clavatum, commonly known as the purple eggplant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, egg-shaped fruits that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the flowers are small, white or pale purple, clustered in axillary inflorescences. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it is often used ornamentally due to its striking appearance."
