    "intro": "Schmidiella maxwellii, commonly known as the Maxwell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green, translucent petals and sepals that resemble a spectral figure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between June and August. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, moist environments, often among leaf litter or in dense undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Schmidiella maxwellii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
