It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a high oil content. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, reaching heights of up to 40 meters.

The species is valued for its timber but is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
