    "intro": "Solanum virescens, commonly known as the green nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Solanum virescens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of solanine and other alkaloids in its leaves and berries."
