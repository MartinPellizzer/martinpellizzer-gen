It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers during the summer months. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and filter water. This variety is well adapted to marshy areas and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
