    "intro": "Saxifraga hibernica, commonly known as the Irish saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe, particularly Ireland and the British Isles. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky outcrops. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and bloom in early spring. Saxifraga hibernica is well adapted to cool, humid climates and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil."
