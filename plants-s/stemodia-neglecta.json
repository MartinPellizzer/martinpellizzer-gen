    "intro": "Stemodia neglecta, commonly known as the slender stemodia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
