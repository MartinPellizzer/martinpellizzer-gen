    "intro": "Solanum jobsonii, commonly known as Jobson's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Solanum jobsonii is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
