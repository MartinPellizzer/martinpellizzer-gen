    "intro": "Spergularia marginata var. illerdensis, commonly known as the Iller Valley sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, pink to white flowers and fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its morphology includes a prostrate growth habit with branching stems and small, alternate leaves. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its specialized adaptations."
