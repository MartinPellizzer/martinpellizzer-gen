    "intro": "Spiraea opulifolia var. nana, commonly known as dwarf spiraea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the branches. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its low-growing habit. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and compact form."
