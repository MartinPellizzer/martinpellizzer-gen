    "intro": "Siphoneugena densiflora var. cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the humid montane forests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers are often visited by specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
