    "intro": "Schoenus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often coated in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in marshy or waterlogged soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
