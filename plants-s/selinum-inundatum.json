    "intro": "Selinum inundatum, commonly known as water garlic, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spikes. The plant thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Selinum inundatum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
