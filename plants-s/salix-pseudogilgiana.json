    "intro": "Salix pseudogilgiana, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
