    "intro": "Schlechterorchis occidentalis, commonly known as the western schlechter's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive strategy relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
