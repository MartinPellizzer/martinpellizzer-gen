It is native to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky substance, which helps it trap small insects. It produces delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. Shizhenia pinguicula is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
