    "intro": "Salvia \u00d7 alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sage, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of down, which helps reduce water loss. Salvia \u00d7 alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
