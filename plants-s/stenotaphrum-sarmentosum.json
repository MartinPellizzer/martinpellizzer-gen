    "intro": "Stenotaphrum sarmentosum, commonly known as coarse-stemmed stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to form a thick turf through stolons and rhizomes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is often found in wetland environments. It is adapted to tolerate flooding and is commonly used in wetland restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important species for stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
