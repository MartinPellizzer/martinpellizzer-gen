    "intro": "Stipa clausa subsp. cazorlensis, commonly known as the Cazorla needlegrass, is a grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
