    "intro": "Sphaerotele, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark green to blackish appearance. The thallus of Sphaerotele is typically foliose or crustose, forming a tightly packed, spherical or globose structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. The plant's symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi is essential to its survival and growth."
