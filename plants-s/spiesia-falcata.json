    "intro": "Spiesia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves and stems contain toxic milky sap, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Spiesia falcata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
