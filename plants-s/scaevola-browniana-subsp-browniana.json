    "intro": "Scaevola browniana subsp. browniana, commonly known as the coastal scabious, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its adaptability to saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
