    "intro": "Spiranthes triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence composed of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, long, spiraled spike of flowers. Spiranthes triloba is pollinated primarily by bees and is an important species in ecological studies due to its specific habitat requirements."
