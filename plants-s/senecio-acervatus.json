    "intro": "Senecio acervatus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Senecio acervatus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
