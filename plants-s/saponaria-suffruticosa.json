    "intro": "Saponaria suffruticosa, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of soft pubescence. Saponaria suffruticosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its historical use in herbal remedies."
