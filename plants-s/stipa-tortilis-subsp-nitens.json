    "intro": "Stipa tortilis subsp. nitens, commonly known as the curly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, pale yellow to brown spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
