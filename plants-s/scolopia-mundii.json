    "intro": "Scolopia mundii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its woody stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Scolopia mundii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
