    "intro": "Sedum catorce, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant typically produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum catorce is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to prevent soil erosion."
