    "intro": "Senna pleurocarpa, commonly known as the yellow senna, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and semi-arid regions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
