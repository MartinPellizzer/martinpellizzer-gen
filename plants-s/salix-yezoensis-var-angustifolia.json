It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
