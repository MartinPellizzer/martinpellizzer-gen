    "intro": "Selaginella dorsicola, commonly known as the mountain spikeweed, is a species of spikeweed native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. The plant features delicate, scale-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a short growth period during the rainy season. Selaginella dorsicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
