    "intro": "Saccoloma plumieri, commonly known as the red swamp fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often tinged with red or brown at the edges. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
