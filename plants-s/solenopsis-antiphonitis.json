    "intro": "Solenopsis antiphonitis, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species of acacia that forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species. Its hollow thorns provide shelter for the ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and elongated, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Paraguay. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered an important component of its native ecosystem."
