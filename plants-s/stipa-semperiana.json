    "intro": "Stipa semperiana, commonly known as the everlasting grass or mountain feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-blue plumes that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest in gardens. Stipa semperiana is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
