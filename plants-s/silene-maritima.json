    "intro": "Silene maritima, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Silene maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
