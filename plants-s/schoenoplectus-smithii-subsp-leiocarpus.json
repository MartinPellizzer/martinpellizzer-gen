    "intro": "Schoenoplectus smithii subsp. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-stalked bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas and shallow water, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are smooth and often slightly hairy, with small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base and often submerged or floating at the water's surface. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to wetland environments, making it an important component of coastal and freshwater ecosystems."
