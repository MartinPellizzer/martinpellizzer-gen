    "intro": "Silene parnassica subsp. dionysii, commonly known as the Parnassius silene, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
