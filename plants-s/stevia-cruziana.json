    "intro": "Stevia cruziana, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. Stevia cruziana is often cultivated as a natural sweetener and has been used traditionally in South American medicine. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
