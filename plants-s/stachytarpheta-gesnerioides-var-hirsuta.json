    "intro": "Stachytarpheta gesnerioides var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bearded sages, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks. Its floral structure is typical of the Verbenaceae family, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
