    "intro": "Sinobaijiania yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
