    "intro": "Sabulina daralagexica, commonly known as the Armenian rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
