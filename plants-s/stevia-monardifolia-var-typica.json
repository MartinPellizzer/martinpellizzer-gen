    "intro": "Stevia monardifolia var. typica, commonly known as sweetleaf or honey plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with small, glandular dots, which contribute to its intense sweetness. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens. The leaves are often used as a natural sweetener due to their high steviol glycoside content."
