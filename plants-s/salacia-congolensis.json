    "intro": "Salacia congolensis, commonly known as the Congo salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other genera within the family. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. Salacia congolensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
