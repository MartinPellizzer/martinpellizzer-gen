    "intro": "Sphaeralcea fendleri var. venusta, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the late afternoon, hence its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Sphaeralcea fendleri var. venusta is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
