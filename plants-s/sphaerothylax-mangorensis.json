It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Due to its unique adaptations, it is an important species in the study of halophytic plants."
