    "intro": "Senecio subulatifolius, commonly known as the needle-leaved groundsel, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
