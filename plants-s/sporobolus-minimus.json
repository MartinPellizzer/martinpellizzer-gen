    "intro": "Sporobolus minimus, commonly known as little burrgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes makes it a resilient species in disturbed areas. Sporobolus minimus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
