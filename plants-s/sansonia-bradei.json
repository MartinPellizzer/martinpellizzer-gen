    "intro": "Sansonia bradei, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich reddish color, though it is also threatened by overexploitation and habitat loss."
