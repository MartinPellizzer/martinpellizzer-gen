It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Senecio bonariensis is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and dry conditions."
