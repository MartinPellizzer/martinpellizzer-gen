    "intro": "Sclerolaena microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited screwwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rutaceae. It is a shrub native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in a thick, protective layer. Sclerolaena microcarpa is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
