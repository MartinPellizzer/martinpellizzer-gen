    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain yellow pitcherplant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps to lure and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, often found in bogs and swamps. Its flowers are typically red or orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variant is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude environments, making it a unique example of Sarracenia's ecological versatility."
