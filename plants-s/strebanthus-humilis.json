    "intro": "Strebanthus humilis, commonly known as the lowland strebanthus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
