    "intro": "Seseli foeniculum, commonly known as hemlock water-dropwort, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, and its foliage is aromatic, with a mild, parsley-like scent. It produces small, greenish-white fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered a potentially poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
