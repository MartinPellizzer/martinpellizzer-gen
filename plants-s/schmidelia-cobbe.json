    "intro": "Schmidelia cobbe, commonly known as the cobbe's schmidelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Schmidelia cobbe is often found in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
