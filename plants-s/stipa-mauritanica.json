    "intro": "Stipa mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soil. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Stipa mauritanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
