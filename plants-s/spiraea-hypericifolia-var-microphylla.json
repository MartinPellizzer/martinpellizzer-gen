    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its compact size and long-lasting floral display."
