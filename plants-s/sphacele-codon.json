    "intro": "Sphacele codon, commonly known as the spherical codon, is a hypothetical concept in molecular biology rather than a real plant. It refers to a theoretical arrangement of nucleotides in the genetic code. While not a plant species, the term is sometimes misused in botanical discussions. The idea has no direct botanical counterpart in plant biology. Therefore, it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense."
