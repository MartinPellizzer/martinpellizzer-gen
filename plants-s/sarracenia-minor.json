    "intro": "Sarracenia minor, commonly known as the lesser purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid. The plant's pitchers are typically purple or reddish in color, with a narrow throat that aids in trapping insects. Sarracenia minor thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and sunlight. It is often found in bogs and swampy areas, where it plays a unique ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
