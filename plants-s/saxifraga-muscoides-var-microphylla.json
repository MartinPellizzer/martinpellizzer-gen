    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are often borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its significantly smaller leaves and compact growth habit."
