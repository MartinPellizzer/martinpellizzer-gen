    "intro": "Spiraea hayatana, commonly known as Japanese weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its leaves are ovate and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the floral display. Spiraea hayatana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
