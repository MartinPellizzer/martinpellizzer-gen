    "intro": "Salix duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux willow, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, Salix duclouxii is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
