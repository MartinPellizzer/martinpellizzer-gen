    "intro": "Salvia eigii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Salvia eigii is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
