    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos paraguayense, commonly known as the Paraguay orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, producing clusters of white or pale yellow blooms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
