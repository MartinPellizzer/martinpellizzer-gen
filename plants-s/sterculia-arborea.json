It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-shaped crown. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in yellow or greenish-white colors. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, fibrous seeds. The leaves are palmately lobed and shed seasonally, contributing to its distinctive appearance in the landscape."
