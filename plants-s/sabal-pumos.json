    "intro": "Sabal pumos, commonly known as the cabbage palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the southeastern United States. It has a smooth, gray trunk that can grow up to 60 feet in height, and it produces clusters of white, spadix-like flowers that emerge from a leafy bract. The plant is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same individual, and it relies on wind pollination. Its fruit is a three-lobed, reddish-purple berry that contains a single seed. The leaves are long, pinnately compound, and provide shade, making it a valuable plant in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
