    "intro": "Saussurea caudata, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower or red safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It features a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of bright yellow to orange flower heads. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and is often found in rocky, alpine environments. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Saussurea caudata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used in local cultural practices."
