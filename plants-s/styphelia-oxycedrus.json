    "intro": "Styphelia oxycedrus, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its dense foliage. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Styphelia oxycedrus is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
