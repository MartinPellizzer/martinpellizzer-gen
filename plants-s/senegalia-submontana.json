    "intro": "Senegalia submontana, commonly known as the whitebrush acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and slender, branching structure, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Senegalia submontana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
