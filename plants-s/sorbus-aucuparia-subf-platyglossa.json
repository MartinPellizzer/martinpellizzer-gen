    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subf. platyglossa, commonly known as the smooth-fruited whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruits, which distinguish it from other subspecies of the common whitebeam. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that are a food source for birds. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides."
