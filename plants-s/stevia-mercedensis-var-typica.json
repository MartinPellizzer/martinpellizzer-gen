    "intro": "Stevia mercedensis var. typica, commonly known as the Merced stevia, is a rare species native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a perennial herb characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
