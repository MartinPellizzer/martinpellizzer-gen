    "intro": "Sorghum mekongense, commonly known as the Mekong sorghum, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia. It is a tall, robust grass that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves and panicles of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in moist, fertile soils. Its roots are fibrous and capable of fixing nitrogen, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment. The plant is often used for forage, erosion control, and in traditional agricultural systems."
