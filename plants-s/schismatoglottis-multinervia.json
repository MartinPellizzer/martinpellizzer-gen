    "intro": "Schismatoglottis multinervia, commonly known as the veined schismatoglottis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and lanceolate, dark green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Schismatoglottis multinervia is appreciated for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
