It is an annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and oval-shaped, which distinguishes it from other varieties of the species. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Brassicaceae family. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
