    "intro": "Stelis tamboensis, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually green and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Stelis tamboensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
