    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hayatana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Salix discolor and Salix amygdaloides, resulting in a plant with distinctive features combining traits from both parents. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy texture. It produces catkins in early spring, and its flexible branches make it suitable for ornamental landscaping. This species is also valued for its ability to thrive in moist soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
