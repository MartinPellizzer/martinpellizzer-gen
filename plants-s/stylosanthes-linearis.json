    "intro": "Stylosanthes linearis, commonly known as the slender stylo, is a low-growing perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It is widely used as forage for livestock due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. Additionally, Stylosanthes linearis plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
