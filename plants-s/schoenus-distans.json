    "intro": "Schoenus distans, commonly known as the marsh grass or slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Schoenus distans plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity."
