    "intro": "Sarcochilus carrii, commonly known as the Carri's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green to yellowish-green pseudobulbs and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle pinkish tinge. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus carrii is considered a vulnerable species."
