    "intro": "Selaginella rubella, commonly known as the ruby moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features dense, compact foliage with bright red or purple hues, especially under certain light conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces spores that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Selaginella rubella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
