    "intro": "Salix nivea, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, greenish fruits. Its bark is thin and grayish-white, and it is often found in moist, sandy soils near rivers or lakes. Salix nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its salicin content, similar to willow bark."
