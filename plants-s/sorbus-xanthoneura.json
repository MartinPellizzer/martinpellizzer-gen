    "intro": "Sorbus xanthoneura, commonly known as the yellow-leafed whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow leaves that turn orange-red in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age. Sorbus xanthoneura is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
