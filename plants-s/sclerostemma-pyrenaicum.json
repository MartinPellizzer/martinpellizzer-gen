    "intro": "Sclerostemma pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Sclerostemma pyrenaicum thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to high-altitude environments."
