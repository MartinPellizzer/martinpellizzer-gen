    "intro": "Scutellaria cylindriflora, commonly known as the cylindrical beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Scutellaria cylindriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
