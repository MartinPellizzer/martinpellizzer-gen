It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikes of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiky bur-like fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water and animals. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
