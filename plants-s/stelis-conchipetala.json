    "intro": "Stelis conchipetala, commonly known as the waxy orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Stelis conchipetala is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
