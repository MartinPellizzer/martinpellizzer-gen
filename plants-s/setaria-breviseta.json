    "intro": "Setaria breviseta, commonly known as rough false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with short, stiff hairs along the edges, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like structures that produce minute seeds. Setaria breviseta is often found in prairies, roadsides, and other open habitats."
