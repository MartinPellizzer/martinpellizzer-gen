    "intro": "Sabulina uralensis, commonly known as the Ural sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Sabulina uralensis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with high altitudes and limited soil depth."
