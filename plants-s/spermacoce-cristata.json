    "intro": "Spermacoce cristata, commonly known as the crowned starburry, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a star-like appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Spermacoce cristata is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
