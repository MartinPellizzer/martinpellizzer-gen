    "intro": "Shorea monticola, commonly known as the hill teak, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its durable, heavy timber that is highly valued in the furniture and construction industries. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense, buttressed root system. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
