It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when mature. Solanum verrucosum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
