    "intro": "Selaginella glauca, commonly known as the blue spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. Selaginella glauca is known for its unique spore-producing structures called strobila, which are borne on specialized branches. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
