    "intro": "Solanum neei, commonly known as the Neel's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Solanum neei is adapted to high-altitude environments and exhibits a variety of ecological interactions, including associations with specific pollinators and seed dispersers. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in mountainous ecosystems."
