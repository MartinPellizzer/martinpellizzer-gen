    "intro": "Swartzia jorori, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Swartzia jorori is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
