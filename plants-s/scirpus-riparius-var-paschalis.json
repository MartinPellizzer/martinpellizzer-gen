    "intro": "Scirpus riparius var. paschalis, commonly known as the marsh club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters, and its dense, spiky inflorescences that produce small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic environment."
