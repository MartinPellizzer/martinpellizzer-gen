    "intro": "Sedum scabrum, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
