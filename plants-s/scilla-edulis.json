    "intro": "Scilla edulis, commonly known as the edible squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range from white to blue-purple. The plant produces a bulb that is edible when young, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if not prepared properly. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its toxic potential, it is important to handle and consume Scilla edulis with caution."
