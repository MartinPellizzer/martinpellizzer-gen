    "intro": "Stipa longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Stipa longifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, making it an ecologically valuable plant."
