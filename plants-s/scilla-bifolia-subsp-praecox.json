It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as cliffs and woodland edges. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its early blooming habit, it is also valued in horticulture for adding color to gardens in late winter."
