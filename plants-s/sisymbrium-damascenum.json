    "intro": "Sisymbrium damascenum, commonly known as the Damask mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems and pinnately divided, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a slender, cylindrical pod that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sisymbrium damascenum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
