    "intro": "Salvia serpyllifolia, commonly known as common groundsel, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its leaves contain essential oils and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native flora."
