    "intro": "Stenotopsis, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plants typically have small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. Stenotopsis species are popular as houseplants due to their ability to tolerate low light and minimal watering. Their unique appearance and low maintenance make them a favorite among indoor gardeners."
