    "intro": "Sagittaria rigida f. elliptica, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and elliptical, typically floating on the water surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, followed by three-lobed berries. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life."
