    "intro": "Stipellula capensis, commonly known as the Cape stipple, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. Stipellula capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
