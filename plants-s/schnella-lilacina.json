    "intro": "Schnella lilacina, commonly known as the violet bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and violet. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
