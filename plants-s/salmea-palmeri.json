    "intro": "Salmea palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Salmea palmeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
