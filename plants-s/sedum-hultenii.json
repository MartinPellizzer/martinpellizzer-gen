    "intro": "Sedum hultenii, commonly known as the Hulten's stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It produces basal rosettes of thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. Sedum hultenii is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens."
