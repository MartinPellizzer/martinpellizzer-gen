    "intro": "Stenocactus multicostatus subsp. zacatecasensis, commonly known as the Zacatecas spines, is a small, barrel-shaped cactus native to the Mexican state of Zacatecas. It features a ribbed stem with prominent, sharp spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
