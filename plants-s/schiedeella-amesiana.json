    "intro": "Schiedeella amesiana, commonly known as the Ames's schiedea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its upright, woody stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded areas such as rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. Schiedeella amesiana is notable for its unique morphology, including its hairy leaves and showy bracts that surround the flower clusters. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
