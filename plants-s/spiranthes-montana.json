    "intro": "Spiranthes montana, commonly known as the mountain ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spiraling clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral presence to its natural habitat."
