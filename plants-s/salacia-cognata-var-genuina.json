    "intro": "Salacia cognata var. genuina, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and highly valued tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is prized for its durability and fine grain. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its botanical features include elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
