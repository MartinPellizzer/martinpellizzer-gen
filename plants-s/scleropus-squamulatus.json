    "intro": "Scleropus squamulatus, commonly known as the silver scalebark, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which consists of small, overlapping scales. The plant has a woody stem covered in a thick layer of bark that provides protection against environmental stress. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to harsh climates. The leaves are typically small and leathery, contributing to its drought-resistant properties."
