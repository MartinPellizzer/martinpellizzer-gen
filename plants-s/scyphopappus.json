    "intro": "Scyphopappus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically features basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow to orange flowers. Its adaptations to harsh desert environments include succulent leaves and deep root systems for water storage. Scyphopappus species are often found in rocky soils and play a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
