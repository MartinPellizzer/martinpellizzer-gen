    "intro": "Salicornia rubra var. prona, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant produces small, green or red flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a short growing season and is often found in intertidal zones where it withstands periodic flooding. Its unique morphology and salt tolerance make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
