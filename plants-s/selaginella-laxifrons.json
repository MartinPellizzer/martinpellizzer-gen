It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem that produces erect, branching clusters of leaves, which are usually narrow and linear. Its sporophylls are arranged in whorls and bear microsporangia and megasporangia for reproduction. Selaginella laxifrons is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
