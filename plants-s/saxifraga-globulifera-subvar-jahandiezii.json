    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera subvar. jahandiezii, commonly known as the Afghan snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
