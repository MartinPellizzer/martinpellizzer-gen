    "intro": "Stegolepis hitchcockii subsp. hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's steppic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and desert scrub. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral structure, making it a notable species in its native ecosystem."
