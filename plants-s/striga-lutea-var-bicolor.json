    "intro": "Striga lutea var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its yellow and white striped stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. It is native to Africa and is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its parasitic nature. Its presence can significantly reduce crop yields, making it a subject of ecological and agricultural interest."
