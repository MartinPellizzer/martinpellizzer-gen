It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in the rainy season, producing clusters of bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and branching. Strobilanthes agrestis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
