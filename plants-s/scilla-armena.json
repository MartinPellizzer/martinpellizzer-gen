It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white berries that ripen in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Scilla armena is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
