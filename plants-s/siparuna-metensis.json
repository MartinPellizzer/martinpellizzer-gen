It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are edible for certain wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a pleasant scent when crushed. Siparuna metensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests."
