    "intro": "Sarcoglottis saint-marcelensis, commonly known as the Saint-Marcel's sarcoglottis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
