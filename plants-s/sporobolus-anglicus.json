    "intro": "Sporobolus anglicus, commonly known as English needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
