    "intro": "Salix bonplandiana var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-barked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and slender, often drooping branches. The leaves are typically elongated, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
