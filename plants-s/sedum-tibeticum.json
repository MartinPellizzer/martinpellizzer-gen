    "intro": "Sedum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and cold environments. The plant typically produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is often found growing in rocky crevices and alpine meadows. Sedum tibeticum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
