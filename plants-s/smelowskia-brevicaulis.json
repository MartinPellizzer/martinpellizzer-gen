    "intro": "Smelowskia brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed smelowskia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
