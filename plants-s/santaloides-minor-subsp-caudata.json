    "intro": "Santaloides minor subsp. caudata, commonly known as the hairy sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its subspecific name, *caudata*, refers to the elongated, tail-like appearance of its inflorescences."
