It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties."
