    "intro": "Saxifraga longifolia subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. Its flowers are borne on slender, erect stems and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. The species is characterized by its frost-resistant nature and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments."
