    "intro": "Schwenkfelda glabra, commonly known as the smooth schwenkfeldia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the temperate regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, bluish-green leaves that are smooth to the touch, contributing to its common name. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compact clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Schwenkfelda glabra is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
