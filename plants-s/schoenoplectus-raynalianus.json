It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. This herbaceous perennial typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
