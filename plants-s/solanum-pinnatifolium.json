    "intro": "Solanum pinnatifolium, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
