    "intro": "Scirpus smithii, commonly known as Smith's bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets along the upper part of the stem. Scirpus smithii thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
