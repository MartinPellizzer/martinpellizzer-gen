    "intro": "Smelowskia flavissima, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Smelowskia flavissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
