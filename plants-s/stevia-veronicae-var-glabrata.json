    "intro": "Stevia veronicae var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly for its sweet-tasting leaves used as a natural sweetener. The variety 'glabrata' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which contribute to its unique flavor profile."
