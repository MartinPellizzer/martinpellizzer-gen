    "intro": "Solanum epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic nightshade, is a unique species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or purple in color. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Solanum epiphyticum belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers."
