    "intro": "Senecio lobatus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Senecio lobatus is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in disturbed or degraded habitats."
