    "intro": "Stachys rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
