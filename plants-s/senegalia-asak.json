    "intro": "Senegalia asak, commonly known as the African broom, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Senegalia asak is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate drought, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
