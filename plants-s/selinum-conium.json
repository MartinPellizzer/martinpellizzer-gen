    "intro": "Selinum conium, commonly known as hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly the alkaloid coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is found in temperate regions. Due to its high toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
