    "intro": "Stelis carnosipetala, commonly known as the hairy-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It grows as an epiphyte, typically on trees in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
