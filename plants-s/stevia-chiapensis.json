    "intro": "Stevia chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapan stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing high levels of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Its leaves are typically harvested for their sweet compounds, making it a valuable plant in natural sweetener production. Stevia chiapensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters."
