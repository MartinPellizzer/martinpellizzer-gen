    "intro": "Senecio fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert plains. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, spiny seed capsules."
