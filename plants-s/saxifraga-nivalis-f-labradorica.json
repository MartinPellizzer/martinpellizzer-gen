    "intro": "Saxifraga nivalis f. labradorica, commonly known as the Labrador saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Its frost-resistant nature allows it to survive in harsh, cold climates with minimal snow cover."
