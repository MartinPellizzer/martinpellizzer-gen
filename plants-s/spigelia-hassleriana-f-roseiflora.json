    "intro": "Spigelia hassleriana f. roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered spigelia, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often along stream banks or in rich, organic soils. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture, and it produces small, dark red berries in the fall. This unique cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
