    "intro": "Solanum plousianthemum var. conglutinans, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. Its fruit is typically a small, yellow or orange berry that ripens in the autumn. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for cultivation and is more commonly found in the wild."
