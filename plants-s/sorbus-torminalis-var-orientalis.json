It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The leaves and fruits are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
