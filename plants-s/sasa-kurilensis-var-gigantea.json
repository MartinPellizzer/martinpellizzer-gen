It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant forms dense clumps through rhizome growth, creating thickets in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests."
