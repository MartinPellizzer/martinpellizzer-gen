It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant features arching clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Spiraea ulmaria glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
