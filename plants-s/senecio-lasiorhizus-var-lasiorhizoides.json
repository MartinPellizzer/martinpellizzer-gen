    "intro": "Senecio lasiorhizus var. lasiorhizoides, commonly known as the narrowroot ragwort, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This variety is often found in fynbos vegetation, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
