    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei f. glabrescens, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
