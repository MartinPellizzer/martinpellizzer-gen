    "intro": "Saxifraga verna, commonly known as the spring saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201320 centimeters and features rosettes of fleshy, basal leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Saxifraga verna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
