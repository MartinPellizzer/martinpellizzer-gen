The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
