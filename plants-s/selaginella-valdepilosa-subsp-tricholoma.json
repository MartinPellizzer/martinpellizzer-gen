    "intro": "Selaginella valdepilosa subsp. tricholoma, commonly known as the tricholoma spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both microspores and megaspores on separate structures. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. This subspecies is notable for its morphological variation and ecological adaptability."
