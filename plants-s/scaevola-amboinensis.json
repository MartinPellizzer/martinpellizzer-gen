    "intro": "Scaevola amboinensis, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Australia and the Pacific Islands. It is a low-growing shrub that produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind. Scaevola amboinensis is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal gardens."
