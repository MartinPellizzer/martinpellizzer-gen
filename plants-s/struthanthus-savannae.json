    "intro": "Struthanthus savannae, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in sandy soils. Struthanthus savannae is an important plant for local pollinators and contributes to the ecological balance of its habitat."
