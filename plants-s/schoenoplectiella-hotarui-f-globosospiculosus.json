    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella hotarui f. globosospiculosus, commonly known as the Hotaru Island sedge, is a rare grass-like plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often in areas with poor drainage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
