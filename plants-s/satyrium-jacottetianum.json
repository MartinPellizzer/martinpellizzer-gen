    "intro": "Satyrium jacottetianum, commonly known as the Jacottet's satyrium, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in cloud forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant has a short, creeping stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
