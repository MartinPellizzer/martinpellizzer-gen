    "intro": "Sorghum junghuhnii, commonly known as the Ethiopian sorghum, is a perennial grass native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important forage crop in regions with limited rainfall. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a valuable plant for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
