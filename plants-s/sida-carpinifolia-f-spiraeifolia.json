    "intro": "Sida carpinifolia f. spiraeifolia, commonly known as the spiraeoid sida, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiraling pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. It is native to regions of the southern United States and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, which resembles that of the Spiraea genus, hence its common name."
