    "intro": "Solidago genistoides, commonly known as goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are usually hairy. Solidago genistoides plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
