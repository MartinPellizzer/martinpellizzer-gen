    "intro": "Salix microstachyoides, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in male and female spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian areas. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
