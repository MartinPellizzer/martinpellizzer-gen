    "intro": "Stipa tenuissima var. planicola, commonly known as the flatleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
