    "intro": "Sedum obtusatum subsp. boreale, commonly known as the Arctic sedum, is a perennial succulent native to Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, cold climates. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
