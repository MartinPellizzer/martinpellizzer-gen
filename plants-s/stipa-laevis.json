    "intro": "Stipa laevis, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Stipa laevis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
