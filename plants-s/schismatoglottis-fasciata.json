    "intro": "Schismatoglottis fasciata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of Africa. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often striped leaves that display a zebra-like pattern of green and white. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Schismatoglottis fasciata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
