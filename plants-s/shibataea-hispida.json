It is native to Japan and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Shibataea hispida thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
