    "intro": "Selaginella brausei, commonly known as the Brause's spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, spirally arranged leaves that are often lance-shaped and have a glossy texture. Selaginella brausei is characterized by its ability to reproduce via spores, and it exhibits a unique form of resurrection, where it can survive extreme desiccation and rehydrate when water becomes available. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and evolutionary significance."
