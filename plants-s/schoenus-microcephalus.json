    "intro": "Schoenus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Schoenus microcephalus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and microorganisms."
