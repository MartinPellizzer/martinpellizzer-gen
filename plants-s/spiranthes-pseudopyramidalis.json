    "intro": "Spiranthes pseudopyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear dense clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with rich, organic soil. Its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern, a feature that gives the genus Spiranthes its name. This orchid is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and high salinity."
