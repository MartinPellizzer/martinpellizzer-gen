    "intro": "Salix rhamnifolia subsp. saposhnikovii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in alpine meadows."
