It features a bulbous base with tall, narrow leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Scleria setacea is well adapted to arid conditions and has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
