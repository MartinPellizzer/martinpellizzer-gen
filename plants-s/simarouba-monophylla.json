    "intro": "Simarouba monophylla, commonly known as the yellow spondias, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-brown bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, yellow fruits that turn red when ripe. Its fruits are edible and often used in traditional medicine, while its wood is valued for its durability and workability. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various wildlife species."
