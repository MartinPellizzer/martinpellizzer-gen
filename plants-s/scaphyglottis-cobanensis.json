    "intro": "Scaphyglottis cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species."
