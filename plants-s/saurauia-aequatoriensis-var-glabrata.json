It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in many other species of the genus. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations."
