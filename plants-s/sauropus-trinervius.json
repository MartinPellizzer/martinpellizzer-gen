It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into three main lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
