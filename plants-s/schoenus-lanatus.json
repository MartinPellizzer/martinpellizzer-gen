    "intro": "Schoenus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, cylindrical spikelets that are often clustered in groups. Schoenus lanatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
