It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in soft, hairy structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
