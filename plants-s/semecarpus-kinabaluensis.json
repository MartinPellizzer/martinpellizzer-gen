    "intro": "Semecarpus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapindaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, particularly in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in montane forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
