    "intro": "Solanum distichophyllum, commonly known as the two-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange, contain toxic compounds and are not suitable for human consumption. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
