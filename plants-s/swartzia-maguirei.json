    "intro": "Swartzia maguirei, commonly known as the Guianan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several woody seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, Swartzia maguirei is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
