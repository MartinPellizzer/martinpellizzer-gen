    "intro": "Salix sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, narrow leaves that are thick and leathery, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
