    "intro": "Schedonorus alpinus, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Schedonorus alpinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
