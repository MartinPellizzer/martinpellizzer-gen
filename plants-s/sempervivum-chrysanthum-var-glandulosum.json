    "intro": "Sempervivum chrysanthum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, though it prefers cooler temperatures."
