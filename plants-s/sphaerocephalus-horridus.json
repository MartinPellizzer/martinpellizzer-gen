    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus horridus, commonly known as the roughhead cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, segmented stems and spiny, bristly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its unique morphology helps it conserve water and deter herbivores in its native habitat."
