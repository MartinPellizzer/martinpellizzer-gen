    "intro": "Senecio repangae subsp. pokohinuensis, commonly known as the Kaka Point senecio, is a rare flowering plant endemic to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in coastal environments, often found on rocky shores and cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
