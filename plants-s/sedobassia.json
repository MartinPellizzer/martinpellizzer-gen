    "intro": "Sedobassia, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant's most distinctive feature is its basal rosette of leaves, which form a dense cluster at the water's edge. Sedobassia thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshy areas. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge above the water, contributing to its ecological role in wetland habitats."
