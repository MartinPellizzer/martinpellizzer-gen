    "intro": "Saxifraga mutata, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often have a rosette shape, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Saxifraga mutata is known for its adaptability and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
