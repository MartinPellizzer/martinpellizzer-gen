    "intro": "Selaginella eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, which are often covered in a waxy coating. Selaginella eatonii is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its capacity to enter a dormant state. It is often found in rocky soils and forest understories, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
