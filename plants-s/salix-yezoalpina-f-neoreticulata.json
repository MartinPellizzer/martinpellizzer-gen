    "intro": "Salix yezoalpina f. neoreticulata, commonly known as the Yezo alpine willow, is a unique willow species native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
