    "intro": "Stylocline, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with high altitudes and cool climates. The plants typically have grass-like leaves and produce showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and violet. Stylocline species are often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
