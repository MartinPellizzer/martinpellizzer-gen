    "intro": "Salix koernickei, commonly known as the Koerner's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Salix. It is native to the Andes mountains in South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. This shrub or small tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
