    "intro": "Saxifraga petrophila, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a perennial succulent that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fleshy leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. Saxifraga petrophila is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in alpine meadows and talus slopes."
