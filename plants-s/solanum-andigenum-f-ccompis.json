It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet to purple berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
