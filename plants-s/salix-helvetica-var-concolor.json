    "intro": "Salix helvetica var. concolor, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a smooth, glossy upper surface with a lighter, often whitish or grayish underside. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This species is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as streambanks and woodland edges."
