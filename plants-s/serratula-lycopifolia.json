    "intro": "Serratula lycopifolia, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Serratula lycopifolia is commonly found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
