It is characterized by its smaller, more robust leaves and a slightly bitter taste compared to its domesticated counterpart. This variety thrives in temperate climates and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. It possesses a fibrous root system and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
