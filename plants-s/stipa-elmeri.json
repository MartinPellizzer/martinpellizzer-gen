    "intro": "Stipa elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristle-like flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa elmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
