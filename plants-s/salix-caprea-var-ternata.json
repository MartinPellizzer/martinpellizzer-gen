    "intro": "Salix caprea var. ternata, commonly known as the goat willow or the weeping willow, is a variant of the common willow. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This deciduous shrub or small tree typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its flowers are catkins, which are male and female, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of material for basket weaving."
