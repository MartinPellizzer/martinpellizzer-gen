It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
