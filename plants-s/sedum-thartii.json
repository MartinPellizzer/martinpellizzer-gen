    "intro": "Sedum thartii, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rocky surfaces, where it can access minimal soil and moisture. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually yellow or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Sedum thartii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
