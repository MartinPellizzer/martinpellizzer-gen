    "intro": "Stelis elegantula, commonly known as the elegant lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a dense, dark green to purple floral spike with small, fragrant flowers arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Stelis elegantula is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
