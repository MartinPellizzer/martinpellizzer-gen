    "intro": "Schefflera duidae subsp. quinquestylorum, commonly known as the Queensland schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests or along coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated as a houseplant in many regions."
