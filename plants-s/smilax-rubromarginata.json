    "intro": "Smilax rubromarginata, commonly known as the red-marginated smilax, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves with red-tinged margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries, which are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Smilax rubromarginata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets. Its robust growth habit and distinctive foliage make it a notable component of its native ecosystem."
