    "intro": "Styloglossum ruttenii, commonly known as the Rutten's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. Styloglossum ruttenii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a critically endangered species."
