    "intro": "Stelis furculifera, commonly known as the forked-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stelis furculifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
