    "intro": "Styphelia revoluta, commonly known as the curled leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Styphelia revoluta thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in heathlands and sand dunes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
