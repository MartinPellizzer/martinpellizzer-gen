The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soil conditions. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is often found in maritime hammocks. This variant is distinguished by its unique geographical distribution and ecological adaptations to its specific habitat."
