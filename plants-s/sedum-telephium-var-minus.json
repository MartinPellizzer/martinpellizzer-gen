    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. minus, commonly known as lesser stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy habitats. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
