    "intro": "Seborium, commonly known as the seborrheic dermatitis-associated skin condition, is not a plant but a medical term referring to a skin disorder. It is characterized by the overproduction of sebum, an oily substance, leading to flaky, scaly patches on the skin. While not a botanical subject, seborium is often linked to fungal infections, particularly Malassezia. The condition is more prevalent in areas with high oil production, such as the scalp, face, and chest. Proper skincare and antifungal treatments are typically recommended to manage seborium-related symptoms."
