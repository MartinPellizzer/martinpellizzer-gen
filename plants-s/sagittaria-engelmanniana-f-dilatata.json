    "intro": "Sagittaria engelmanniana f. dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water level. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
