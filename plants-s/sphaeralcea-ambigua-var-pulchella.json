    "intro": "Sphaeralcea ambigua var. pulchella, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, four-petaled flowers that open in the late afternoon, hence its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The species is adapted to full sun and has a low water requirement, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
