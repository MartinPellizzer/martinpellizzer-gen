    "intro": "Selago neglecta, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the sandy soils of coastal regions. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs, helping it withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Selago neglecta plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas."
