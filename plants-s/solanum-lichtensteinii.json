    "intro": "Solanum lichtensteinii, commonly known as the Lichtenstein's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making the plant both intriguing and potentially dangerous."
