    "intro": "Sabina ashei, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Sabina ashei is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. Its foliage and growth habit make it a distinctive feature in desert and coastal regions."
