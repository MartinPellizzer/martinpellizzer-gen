    "intro": "Saussurea macrota var. papyracea, commonly known as the paper saffron, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its leaves are broad and pinnately lobed, and the plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The variety papyracea is notable for its fibrous, papery texture of the plant material, which contributes to its common name."
