    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. firma, commonly known as the firm-leaf willow, is a variant of the broadleaf willow native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely covered with fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in moist, well-drained soils, showcasing its adaptability to wet environments. Its catkins are conspicuous, with male and female flowers arranged separately on the same inflorescence. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
