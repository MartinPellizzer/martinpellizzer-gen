    "intro": "Sida flavescens, commonly known as yellow mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seed pods are capsule-like and contain numerous tiny seeds. Sida flavescens is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in supporting local insect populations."
