    "intro": "Sorbus himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at high altitudes in mountainous regions. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to exfoliate, revealing a lighter inner layer."
