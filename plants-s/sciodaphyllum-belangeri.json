    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's sun-leaf, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, broad, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, a feature that aids in its photosynthetic efficiency in the dense canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum belangeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
