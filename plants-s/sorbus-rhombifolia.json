    "intro": "Sorbus rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamond-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive diamond-shaped leaves, which are alternate and serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by edible, red-orange berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Sorbus rhombifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
