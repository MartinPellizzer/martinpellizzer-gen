    "intro": "Selaginella flexuosa var. tortifolia, commonly known as the twisted clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and adaptation to humid conditions make it a notable species in botanical studies."
