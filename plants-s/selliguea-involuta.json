    "intro": "Selliguea involuta, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. The plant has a thallus that is typically green or reddish in color, with a dense, cushion-like growth form. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are involved in sexual reproduction. Selliguea involuta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
