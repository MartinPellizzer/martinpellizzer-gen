    "intro": "Stethoma verticillaris, commonly known as the spiral tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive spiraling arrangement of branches, which gives it a unique and often striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has small, scale-like leaves and is well adapted to drought conditions. Stethoma verticillaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
