    "intro": "Scirpus supinus var. leucospermus, commonly known as the white-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant."
