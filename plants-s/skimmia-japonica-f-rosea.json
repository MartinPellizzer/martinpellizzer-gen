It features glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive rose-pink hue on the underside, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
