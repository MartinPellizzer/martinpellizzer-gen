    "intro": "Solanum malacoxylon f. albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin nightshade, is a variant of the species Solanum malacoxylon, which belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). This plant is characterized by its distinctive white margins on the leaves, which set it apart from other variants. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to berries, which are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
