    "intro": "Styphelia cordata, commonly known as the pink winterbloom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers during late winter to early spring, making it a striking addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. Styphelia cordata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a unique, hardy plant for cooler climates."
