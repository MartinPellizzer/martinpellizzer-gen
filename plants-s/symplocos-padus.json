    "intro": "Symplocos padus, commonly known as swamp alder, is a deciduous shrub native to wetlands and riparian areas in North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in marshy environments. Symplocos padus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
