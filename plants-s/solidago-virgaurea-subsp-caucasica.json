    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea subsp. caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widespread S. virgaurea."
