    "intro": "Silene cucubalus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have a bluish-green hue due to the dense pubescence. Silene cucubalus var. pubescens is often found in dry, rocky or sandy soils, thriving in open, sunny habitats."
