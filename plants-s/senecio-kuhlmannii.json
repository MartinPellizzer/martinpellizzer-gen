    "intro": "Senecio kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a compact, mat-forming growth habit, often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Senecio kuhlmannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
