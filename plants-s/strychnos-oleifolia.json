    "intro": "Strychnos oleifolia, commonly known as the oil tree or African oil tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine, which are found in its seeds and roots. Despite its toxicity, it has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a source of oil and in folk medicine."
