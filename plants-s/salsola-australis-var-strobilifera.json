    "intro": "Salsola australis var. strobilifera, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments. It features small, spiny leaves that reduce water loss and aid in deterring herbivores. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to flourish in extreme conditions, supporting local wildlife and maintaining habitat diversity."
