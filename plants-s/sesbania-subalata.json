    "intro": "Sesbania subalata, commonly known as the silverleaf sesbania, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that turn silvery white when mature, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agroforestry for its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Sesbania subalata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and role in soil conservation."
