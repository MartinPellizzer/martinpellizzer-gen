    "intro": "Statice lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese lavender or sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Statice lusitanica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
