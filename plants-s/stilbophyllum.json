It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant has long, flexible petioles that allow the leaves to remain buoyant on the water's surface. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a unique structure that includes a central spadix surrounded by showy bracts. Stilbophyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
