    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 podperae, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix schwerinii (a type of willow native to Central Asia). The plant is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Salix \u00d7 podperae is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and ability to thrive in moist soils."
