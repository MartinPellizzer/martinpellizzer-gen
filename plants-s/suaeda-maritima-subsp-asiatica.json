It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, estuaries, and tidal flats. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder in some regions."
