    "intro": "Sorbus neglecta, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Sorbus neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
