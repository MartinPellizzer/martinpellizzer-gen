    "intro": "Sabulina subtilis subsp. subtilis, commonly known as the fine-haired sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in short inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its morphology is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds, making it a characteristic component of polar and alpine vegetation."
