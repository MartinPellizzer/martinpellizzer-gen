    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 coppinianum, commonly known as the hybrid giant pteridium, is a rare and unique hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Selenipedium albidum and Selenipedium mexicanum. It is characterized by its large, showy, and often fragrant inflorescence that can reach several feet in height. The plant is native to the cloud forests of Central America and is known for its striking, palm-like appearance with long, narrow leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
