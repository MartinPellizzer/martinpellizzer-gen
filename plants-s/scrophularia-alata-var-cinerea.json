    "intro": "Scrophularia alata var. cinerea, commonly known as the hairy figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and typically have a grayish or bluish-green hue due to the dense pubescence. It produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This species thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland margins or along stream banks."
