    "intro": "Spergularia platensis, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky coastlines. Spergularia platensis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
