    "intro": "Suaeda rosmarinus, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in saline environments. The plant features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Suaeda rosmarinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
