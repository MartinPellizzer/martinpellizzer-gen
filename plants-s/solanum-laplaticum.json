    "intro": "Solanum laplaticum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, erect stems and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
