    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 scrobigera, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix triandra (yellow willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive cascading branches that give it a graceful appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds."
