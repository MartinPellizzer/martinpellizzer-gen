    "intro": "Sasa yenaensis, commonly known as the Yena bamboo, is a clump-forming grass found in the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense thickets. Sasa yenaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of sustainable materials."
