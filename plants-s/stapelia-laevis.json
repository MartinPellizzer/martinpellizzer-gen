    "intro": "Stapelia laevis, commonly known as the smooth stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in arid environments. Stapelia laevis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
