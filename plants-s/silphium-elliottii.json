It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, upright leaves that resemble a compass, hence its common name. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in the summer, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Silphium elliottii is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It is considered a valuable native plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
