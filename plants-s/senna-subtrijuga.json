    "intro": "Senna subtrijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Senna subtrijuga is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
