    "intro": "Schizaea robusta, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, feather-like foliage that resembles moss. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. Schizaea robusta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitats."
