    "intro": "Senega officinalis, commonly known as the yellow root, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its yellow rhizomes, which are the primary part used medicinally. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has palmately divided leaves. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
