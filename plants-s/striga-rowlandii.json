    "intro": "Striga rowlandii, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, often causing significant damage to crops like maize and sorghum. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to Africa and is considered a major weed in agricultural systems. Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years."
