    "intro": "Silene rosulata var. tingitana, commonly known as the Moroccan catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. It is a perennial species that blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
