    "intro": "Santalum pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger sandalwood, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is native to Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
