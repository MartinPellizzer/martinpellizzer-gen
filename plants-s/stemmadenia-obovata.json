    "intro": "Stemmadenia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate stemmadenia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features woody stems with a rough, fissured bark that exudes a milky sap when damaged. The plant has alternate, ovate to obovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine."
