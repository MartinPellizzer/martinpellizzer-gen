    "intro": "Sterigmanthe bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's sterculia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
