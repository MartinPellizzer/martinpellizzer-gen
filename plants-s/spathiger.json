    "intro": "Spathiger, commonly known as the orchid spike or orchid stem, is a unique plant structure that plays a crucial role in the reproductive process of certain orchid species. It is a modified stem that supports the inflorescence, which consists of a cluster of flowers arranged in a spike. The spathiger is typically elongated and often covered in a protective sheath called the spathe. This structure helps protect the developing flowers until they are ready to bloom. In some species, the spathiger may also serve as a means of dispersing seeds or attracting pollinators."
