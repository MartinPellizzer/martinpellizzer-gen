    "intro": "Spiesia rupifraga, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy coating. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil and cold climates. Spiesia rupifraga is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in difficult garden settings."
