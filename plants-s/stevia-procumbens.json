    "intro": "Stevia procumbens, commonly known as sweetleaf or honey plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is well-known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. Stevia procumbens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for use in ornamental gardens. Its medicinal and culinary uses have been recognized for centuries, particularly for its intense sweetness and potential health benefits."
