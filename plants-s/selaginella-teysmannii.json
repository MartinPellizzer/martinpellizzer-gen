It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features a root system and a stem that bears spirally arranged leaves, which are often scale-like or needle-like in appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella teysmannii is noted for its resilience and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
