    "intro": "Serruria artemisiifolia, commonly known as the African rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that resemble those of the wormwood plant, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Serruria artemisiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
