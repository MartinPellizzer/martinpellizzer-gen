    "intro": "Scleranthus durandoi, commonly known as the Durando's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with erect, branched stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Scleranthus durandoi is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
