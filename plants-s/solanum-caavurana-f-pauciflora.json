    "intro": "Solanum caavurana f. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered nightshade, is a rare and unique variant of the Solanum genus. It is characterized by its reduced floral display, with only a few small, violet flowers clustered near the base of the plant. The leaves are typically ovate and slightly hairy, with a rough texture. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
