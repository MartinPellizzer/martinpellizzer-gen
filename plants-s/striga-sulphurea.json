    "intro": "Striga sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur ghost or sulfur weed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in association with grasses. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green to sulfur-yellow coloration, which gives it its common name. Its small, lance-shaped leaves and lack of true roots make it a hemiparasitic species, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. Striga sulphurea is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
