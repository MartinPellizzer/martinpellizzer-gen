    "intro": "Strigosella myrzakulovii, commonly known as the Myrzakulov's strigosella, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, small compound leaves, and delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
