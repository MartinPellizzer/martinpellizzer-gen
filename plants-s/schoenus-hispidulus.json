    "intro": "Schoenus hispidulus, commonly known as the hispid marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Schoenus hispidulus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
