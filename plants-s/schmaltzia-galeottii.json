    "intro": "Schmaltzia galeottii, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. The plant features grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Schmaltzia galeottii is adapted to drought and salt spray, making it resilient in harsh environments. Its botanical characteristics reflect its role as a hardy, low-maintenance plant in Mediterranean ecosystems."
