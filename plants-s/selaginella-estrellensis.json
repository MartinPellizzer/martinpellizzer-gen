    "intro": "Selaginella estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellensis spikerush, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss found in specific microhabitats in Mexico. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in soil-rich crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat destruction and limited natural range, it faces significant threats to its survival."
