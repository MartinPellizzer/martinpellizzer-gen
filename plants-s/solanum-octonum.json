    "intro": "Solanum octonum, commonly known as the eight-angled nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its distinctive eight-angled stems and small, violet-colored flowers. Its fruits are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids, making them dangerous if consumed unripe. Solanum octonum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
