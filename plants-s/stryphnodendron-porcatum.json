    "intro": "Stryphnodendron porcatum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
