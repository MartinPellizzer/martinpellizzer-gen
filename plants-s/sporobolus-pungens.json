    "intro": "Sporobolus pungens, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted for survival in arid and sandy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sporobolus pungens is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
