    "intro": "Sarcostemma grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered milkweed, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellowish center. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Sarcostemma grandiflorum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
