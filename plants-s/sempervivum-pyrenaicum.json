    "intro": "Sempervivum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the Pyrenees region. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky, alpine environments and thrives in full sun. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
