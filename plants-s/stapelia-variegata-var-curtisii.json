    "intro": "Stapelia variegata var. curtisii, commonly known as the variegated stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a waxy, greenish-brown cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a slight bluish tint, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
