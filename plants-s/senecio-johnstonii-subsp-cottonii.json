    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii subsp. cottonii, commonly known as Cotton's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in the United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, daisy-like clusters. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas within its native range."
