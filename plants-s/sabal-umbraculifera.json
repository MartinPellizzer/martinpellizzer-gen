    "intro": "Sabal umbraculifera, commonly known as the umbrella palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a dense crown of pinnately arranged, dark green leaves that give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark purple, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
