    "intro": "Stellilabium pseudobulbosum, commonly known as the false bulb orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring showy, star-shaped blooms that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
