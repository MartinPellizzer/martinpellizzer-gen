    "intro": "Solidago notabilis, commonly known as the showy goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually erect and branching. Solidago notabilis plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
