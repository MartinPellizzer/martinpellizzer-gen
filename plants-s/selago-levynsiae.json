    "intro": "Selago levynsiae, commonly known as the St. Helena dandelion, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds for reproduction. Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Selago levynsiae is considered a vulnerable species."
