    "intro": "Spiraea camtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 3 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate colder climates and its role in supporting local pollinators."
