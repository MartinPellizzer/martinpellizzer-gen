    "intro": "Salix arctica f. typica, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a low-growing form that helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife. Its flowering occurs in early spring, contributing to the limited floral diversity in its ecosystem."
