    "intro": "Stevia camachensis, commonly known as sweetleaf or sugarleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with opposite, serrated leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its intense sweetness and low calorie content, it has gained popularity as a natural alternative to sugar."
