    "intro": "Sutera aethiopica, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable feature and can cause skin irritation. Sutera aethiopica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
