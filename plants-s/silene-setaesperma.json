It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene setaesperma is a perennial species that produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds."
