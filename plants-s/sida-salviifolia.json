    "intro": "Sida salviifolia, commonly known as Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is an annual herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
