    "intro": "Salix chaenomeloides var. glandulifolia, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered with glandular dots. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
