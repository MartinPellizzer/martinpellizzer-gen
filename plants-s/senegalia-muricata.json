    "intro": "Senegalia muricata, commonly known as the thorned acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. Senegalia muricata also serves as a valuable source of food and habitat for various desert animals."
