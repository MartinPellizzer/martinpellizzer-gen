    "intro": "Solea longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf sole, is a marine plant belonging to the family Soleidae. It is characterized by its elongated, leaf-like structures that are adapted for photosynthesis in shallow coastal waters. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy substrates along the intertidal zones of temperate regions. Its leaves are often ribbon-shaped and can vary in color depending on the environmental conditions. Solea longifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms."
