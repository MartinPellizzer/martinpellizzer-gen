    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon yungasense, commonly known as the Yungas stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Bolivia and Argentina. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the cloud forests of the Andes. Its leaves are often large and glossy, adapted to capture moisture from the misty environment. Stigmaphyllon yungasense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
