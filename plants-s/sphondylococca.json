It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical name reflects its unique growth habit, with \"sphondylos\" referring to the clustered flower heads. Sphondylococca is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
