    "intro": "Stelis fissurata, commonly known as the crevice orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and substrates it inhabits. Stelis fissurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
