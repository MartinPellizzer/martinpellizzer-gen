    "intro": "Stylidium beaugleholei, commonly known as the Beauglehole's sun-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its vivid yellow flowers with dark purple markings, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
