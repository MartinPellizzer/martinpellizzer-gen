It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. It has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects."
