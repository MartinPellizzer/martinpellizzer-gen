    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. calcareum, commonly known as the limestone sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water and withstand harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its resilience and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
