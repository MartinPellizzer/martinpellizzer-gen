    "intro": "Saxifraga macrostigma f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
