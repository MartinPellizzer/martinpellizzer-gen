    "intro": "Senecio ferrugineus, commonly known as the rustweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a slender, upright stem covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Senecio ferrugineus is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
