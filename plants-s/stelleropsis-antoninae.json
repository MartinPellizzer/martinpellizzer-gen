    "intro": "Stelleropsis antoninae, commonly known as the Antonina's star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, globular shape with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Stelleropsis antoninae is valued for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
