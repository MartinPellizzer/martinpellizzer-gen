    "intro": "Saxifraga mengtzeana, commonly known as the Mengtzean saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. The plant features fleshy, basal leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga mengtzeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
