It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical clusters of small, greenish flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species. Scirpus maritimus is adapted to periodic flooding and can tolerate high salinity levels."
