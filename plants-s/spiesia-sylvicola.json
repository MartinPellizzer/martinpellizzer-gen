    "intro": "Spiesia sylvicola, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in temperate to cold climates. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its showy yellow flowers appear in late spring and are arranged in a single terminal umbel. Spiesia sylvicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural requirements."
