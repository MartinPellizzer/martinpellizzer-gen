    "intro": "Sideritis fruticulosa var. illerdensis, commonly known as the Illerda mountain germander, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which are typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
