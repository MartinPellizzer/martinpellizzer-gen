It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, smooth, spherical fruits that contain tiny seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
