    "intro": "Scleranthus picturatus, commonly known as the painted sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with distinctive, intricate patterns on the petals, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a rough, hairy texture. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
