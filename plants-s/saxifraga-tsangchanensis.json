    "intro": "Saxifraga tsangchanensis, commonly known as the Tsangchan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
