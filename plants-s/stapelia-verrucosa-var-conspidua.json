    "intro": "Stapelia verrucosa var. conspidua, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in arid environments."
