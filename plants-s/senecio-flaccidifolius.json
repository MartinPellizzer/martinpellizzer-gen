It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, and its yellow flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
