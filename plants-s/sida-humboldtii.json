    "intro": "Sida humboldtii, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Sida humboldtii is also known for its historical use by indigenous peoples for various medicinal purposes."
