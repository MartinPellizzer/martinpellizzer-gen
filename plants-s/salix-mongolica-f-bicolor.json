It is characterized by its striking bicoloration, with the upper surface of the leaves typically displaying a silver or white hue while the underside remains green. This plant is native to the cold climates of Mongolia and northern China, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage provides valuable habitat for various insects and small animals. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
