    "intro": "Sergia, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly prized for its durability and unique grain patterns. The plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching ages of over a century. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, sergia is now critically endangered and protected under international conservation laws."
