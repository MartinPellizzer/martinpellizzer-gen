    "intro": "Sisymbrium obtusangulum, commonly known as the blunt-angled broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, but it does not produce flowers or seeds of its own. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its small, scale-like leaves are adapted for attachment to host roots, and it has a short, cylindrical stem. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
