    "intro": "Schoenus krausei, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus krausei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
