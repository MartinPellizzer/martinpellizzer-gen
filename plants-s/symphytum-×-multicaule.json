    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 multicaule, commonly known as the common comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, spiky blue or purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
