    "intro": "Sphacophyllum pusillum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in shallow, still waters. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both its prey-trapping structures and its role as a food source for various invertebrates."
