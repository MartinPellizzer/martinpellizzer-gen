    "intro": "Solidago uliginosa var. linoides, commonly known as the slender goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and other wetland environments. Its leaves are linear and tapering, contributing to its overall slender appearance. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
