    "intro": "Saxifraga olympica, commonly known as the Olympic saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. It is a perennial herb with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga olympica is a rare and endemic species, making it a unique part of the region's botanical diversity."
