    "intro": "Salisburyodendron corbassonii, commonly known as the Corbasson's sycamore, is a rare and ancient tree species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which exfoliates to reveal a mottled, pale inner layer. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth margin with a slightly serrated edge. This species is valued for its historical significance and is often found in old-growth forests where it contributes to ecological diversity."
