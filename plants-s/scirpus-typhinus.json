    "intro": "Scirpus typhinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Scirpus typhinus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
