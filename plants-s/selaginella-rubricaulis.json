    "intro": "Selaginella rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features delicate, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces cone-like structures that contain spores. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, a common strategy among many spore-producing plants. Selaginella rubricaulis is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique morphology that reflects its evolutionary adaptations to its ecological niche."
