    "intro": "Seseli nortonii, commonly known as Norton's seseli, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
