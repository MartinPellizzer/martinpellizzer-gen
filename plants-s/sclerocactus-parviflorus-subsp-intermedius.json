    "intro": "Sclerocactus parviflorus subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate small-flowered sclerocactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, barrel-shaped stem and sparsely distributed, short spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
