    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus tenacissimus, commonly known as the Indian sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and covered with fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Sporobolus indicus tenacissimus is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used for erosion control in disturbed soils."
