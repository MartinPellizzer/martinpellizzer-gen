    "intro": "Siphotria squamosa, commonly known as the sand dune lily, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, scaly texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Siphotria squamosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
