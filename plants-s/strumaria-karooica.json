    "intro": "Strumaria karooica, commonly known as the Karoo bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Strumaria karooica is often found in open grasslands and is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
