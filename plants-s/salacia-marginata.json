    "intro": "Salacia marginata, commonly known as the marginated salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Salacia marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
