It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
