    "intro": "Solanum schulzianum, commonly known as the Schultesian nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its berries are typically yellow or orange when ripe and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers."
