It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue or purple. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
