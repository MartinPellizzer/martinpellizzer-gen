    "intro": "Sorbus coronata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-topped whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in colder climates."
