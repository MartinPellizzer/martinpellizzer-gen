    "intro": "Salix monadelpha, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it is often found in moist, riparian habitats. It has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types. The yellow willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize stream banks."
