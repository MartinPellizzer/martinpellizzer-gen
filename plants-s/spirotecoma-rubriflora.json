    "intro": "Spirotecoma rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered spiraling vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its helical growth pattern, where the stems twist around supporting structures in a spiral formation. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Spirotecoma rubriflora is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
