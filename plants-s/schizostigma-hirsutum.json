    "intro": "Schizostigma hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy schizostigma, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. Schizostigma hirsutum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and horticulture."
