It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically have five petals, with colors ranging from white to pale yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal."
