    "intro": "Stisseria hirtella, commonly known as the hairy stisseria, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Stisseria hirtella thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
