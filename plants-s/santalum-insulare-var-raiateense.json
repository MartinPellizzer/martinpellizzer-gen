    "intro": "Santalum insulare var. raiateense, commonly known as the Raiatea sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia. It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, relying on other plants for some of its nutrients while also contributing to the ecosystem through its root system. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in perfumery and carving. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
