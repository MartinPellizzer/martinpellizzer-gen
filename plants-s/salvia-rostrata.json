    "intro": "Salvia rostrata, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia rostrata is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
