    "intro": "Stelis kunturmarkae, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, brightly colored blooms, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-draining soil, and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
