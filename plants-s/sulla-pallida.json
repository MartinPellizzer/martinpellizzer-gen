    "intro": "Sulla pallida, commonly known as pale hellebore, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, pale green to white leaves that are often described as being similar to those of the hellebore genus. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. Sulla pallida is known for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is considered a rare plant in many regions."
