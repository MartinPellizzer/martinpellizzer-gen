    "intro": "Spiranthes sparsiflora, commonly known as the slender spirea, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and marshes, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Spiranthes sparsiflora is a herbaceous perennial, often found in open, sunny habitats across the eastern and central United States."
