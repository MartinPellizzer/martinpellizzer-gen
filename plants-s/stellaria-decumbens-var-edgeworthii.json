    "intro": "Stellaria decumbens var. edgeworthii, commonly known as Edgeworth's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs, and it is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from other Stellaria species."
