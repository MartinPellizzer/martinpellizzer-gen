    "intro": "Sedum rupifragum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a perennial succulent native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, adding visual interest to its otherwise low-growing form. It typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Due to its hardiness and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
