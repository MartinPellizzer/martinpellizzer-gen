    "intro": "Sisymbrium nitidum, commonly known as the smooth shepherd's purse, is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, triangular seed pods that resemble a purse, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has hairy stems and alternate leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. The flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological diversity."
