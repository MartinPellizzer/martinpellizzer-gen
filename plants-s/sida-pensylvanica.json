    "intro": "Sida pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania morning glory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, fields, and along roadsides. Sida pensylvanica is also notable for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
