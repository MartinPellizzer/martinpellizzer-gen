    "intro": "Sarcomphalus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons. The plant produces small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that are typically monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are present on the same plant. Its fruit, which resembles a small starfruit, is edible and has a tangy, citrus-like flavor. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit."
