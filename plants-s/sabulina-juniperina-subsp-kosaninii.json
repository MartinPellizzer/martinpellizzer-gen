    "intro": "Sabulina juniperina subsp. kosaninii, commonly known as the Kosanin's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
