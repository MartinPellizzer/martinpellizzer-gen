    "intro": "Spiranthes elata var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled ladies' tresses, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by flies and beetles, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which give it its common name."
