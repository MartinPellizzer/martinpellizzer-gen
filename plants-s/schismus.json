These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Schismus species are characterized by their prostrate growth habit, hairy stems, and small, clustered flowers. They often thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and are adapted to drought conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
