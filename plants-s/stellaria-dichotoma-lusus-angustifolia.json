    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma lusus angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has thin, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated primarily by insects."
