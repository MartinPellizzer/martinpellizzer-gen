    "intro": "Selinum nigricans, commonly known as black sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Selinum nigricans plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
