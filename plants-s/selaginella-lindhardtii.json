    "intro": "Selaginella lindhardtii, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are clustered around a central axis, and it produces cone-like structures for reproduction. It is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in tropical ecosystems. Selaginella lindhardtii is also recognized for its potential in phytoremediation due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals from the environment."
