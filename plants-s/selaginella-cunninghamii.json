    "intro": "Selaginella cunninghamii, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. This species is native to Australia and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Selaginella cunninghamii exhibits a unique ability to survive in harsh environments due to its desiccation-tolerant spores. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
