    "intro": "Salix phanera var. phanera, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring slender, upright branches and lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length. The leaves are often glaucous on the upper surface and have a prominent midrib, with a pointed tip. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This species is adapted to moist environments and is often found in stream banks and wetlands."
