    "intro": "Stipa iberica f. laevis, commonly known as the smooth Spanish feathergrass, is a grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs on its leaves and inflorescence. The plant produces a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its low-growing form makes it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use in dry gardens."
