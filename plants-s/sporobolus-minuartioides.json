    "intro": "Sporobolus minuartioides, commonly known as the mountain sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in high elevation environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous growth habit and the ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Sporobolus minuartioides is adapted to drought and can survive in low-nutrient environments."
