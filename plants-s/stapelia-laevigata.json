    "intro": "Stapelia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are small, reduced, and often modified into spines, which help reduce water loss. Stapelia laevigata is a popular choice for xerophytic gardens due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
