    "intro": "Solanum solitarium, commonly known as the solitary nightshade, is a rare and elusive plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, solitary flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange, contain toxic compounds similar to those found in other nightshades. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Solanum solitarium is considered a critically endangered species."
