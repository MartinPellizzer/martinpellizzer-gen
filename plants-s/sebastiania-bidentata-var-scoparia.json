It features small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive two-toothed margin, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries that are a characteristic feature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland or swampy habitats. Its botanical structure makes it an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
