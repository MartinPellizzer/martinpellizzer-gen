    "intro": "Stelis navicularis, commonly known as the boat orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, often twisted stem with small, boat-shaped leaves that are usually green and glossy. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that enhances its ornamental appeal. Stelis navicularis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose substrate for optimal growth."
