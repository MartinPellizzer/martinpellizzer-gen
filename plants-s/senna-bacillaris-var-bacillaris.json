It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation."
