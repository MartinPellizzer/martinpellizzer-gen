    "intro": "Sonchus pinnatifidus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lobed leaves and a hairy stem that bears alternate leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming a weed in agricultural fields. The leaves are edible but can be bitter, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
