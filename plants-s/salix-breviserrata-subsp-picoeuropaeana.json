    "intro": "Salix breviserrata subsp. picoeuropaeana, commonly known as the European narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate leaves with short, acute serrations. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found along riverbanks and in wetland habitats, contributing to riparian vegetation."
