    "intro": "Setaria liebmannii, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it an important crop in arid environments. Its seeds are small and oval, typically harvested when the grains are dry and hard. Setaria liebmannii is also valued for its use in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop for livestock."
