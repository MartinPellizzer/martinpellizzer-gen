    "intro": "Symphyopappus compressus, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's structure includes a woody stem with opposite branching, and its seeds are dispersed via wind after maturing in small, fluffy pappus structures."
