    "intro": "Salix famelica, commonly known as the common willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and bright green. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix famelica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
