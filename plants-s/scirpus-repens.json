    "intro": "Scirpus repens, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, spike-like flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense stands that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus repens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
