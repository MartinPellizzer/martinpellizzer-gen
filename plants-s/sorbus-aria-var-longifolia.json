    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are often longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red or orange berries. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
