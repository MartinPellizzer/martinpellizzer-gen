    "intro": "Solanum patellicalyx, commonly known as the Patellica Lyx Tomato, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Himalayas. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
