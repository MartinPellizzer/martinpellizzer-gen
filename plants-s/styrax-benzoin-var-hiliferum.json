    "intro": "Styrax benzoin var. hiliferum, commonly known as the Indian benzoin or wild benzoin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, resinous bark and leaves that are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, leathery fruits. Its resin, known as benjamin, has been used historically in incense and traditional medicine. The species is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical and subtropical forests."
