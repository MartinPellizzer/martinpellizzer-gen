    "intro": "Samolus ebracteatus var. coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila samolus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat."
