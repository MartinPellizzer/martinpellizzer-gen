    "intro": "Stelis fornix, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like shape over the lip. Stelis fornix thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose substrate for optimal growth."
