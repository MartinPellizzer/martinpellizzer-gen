    "intro": "Saulcya hierochuntica, commonly known as the sacred mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with five deeply lobed petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest clearings. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, and its flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
