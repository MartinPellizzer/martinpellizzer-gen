    "intro": "Specklinia octophrys, commonly known as the orchid with eight wings, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are usually fleshy and dark green, while its flowers are small and clustered, often in a raceme-like arrangement. The plant is characterized by its unique, wing-like petals that give it its common name. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
