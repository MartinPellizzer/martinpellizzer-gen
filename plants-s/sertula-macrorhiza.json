    "intro": "Sertula macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-root sertula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features a robust, fleshy root system that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Sertula macrorhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
