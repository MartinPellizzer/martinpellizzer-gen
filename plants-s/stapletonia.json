    "intro": "Stapletonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and striking white or pale pink flowers. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Stapletonia thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of old-growth forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
