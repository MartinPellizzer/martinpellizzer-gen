    "intro": "Saussurea integerrima, commonly known as the Chinese yarrow or the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stem and dense, fluffy flower heads that resemble small spheres. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in arid and high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Saussurea integerrima is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
