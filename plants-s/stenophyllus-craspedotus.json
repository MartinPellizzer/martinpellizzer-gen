    "intro": "Stenophyllus craspedotus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of narrow, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence. Its leaves and stems are covered in prickles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Stenophyllus craspedotus is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments."
