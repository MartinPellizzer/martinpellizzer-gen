    "intro": "Salvia venturana, commonly known as the Venturana sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a gray-green hue that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia venturana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
