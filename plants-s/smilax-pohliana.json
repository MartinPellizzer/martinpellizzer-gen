    "intro": "Smilax pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana catclaw, is a climbing vine native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Smilax pohliana is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
