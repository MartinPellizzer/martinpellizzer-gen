    "intro": "Selaginella myosurus, commonly known as the running spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit, with erect, spike-like stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. Selaginella myosurus produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a characteristic feature of its reproductive system. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ability to survive in extreme conditions."
