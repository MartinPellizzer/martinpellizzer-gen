    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis var. maritimus, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in low vegetation zones along shorelines, where it tolerates high salt levels and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
