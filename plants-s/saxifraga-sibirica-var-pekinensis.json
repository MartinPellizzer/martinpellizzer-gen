    "intro": "Saxifraga sibirica var. pekinensis, commonly known as the Peking saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, usually clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often found in high-altitude environments."
