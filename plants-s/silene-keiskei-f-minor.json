    "intro": "Silene keiskei f. minor, commonly known as the lesser ghost flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
