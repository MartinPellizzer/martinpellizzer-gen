    "intro": "Selago valliscitri, commonly known as the common sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. Selago valliscitri is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
