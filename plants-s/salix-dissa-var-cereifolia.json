    "intro": "Salix dissa var. cereifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf willow, is a variant of the silver willow native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows along water bodies and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. The waxleaf willow is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and graceful growth habit."
