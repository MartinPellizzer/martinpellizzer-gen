    "intro": "Selaginella temehaniensis, commonly known as the Temehani spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with clustered, scale-like leaves that are often reddish in color. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in tropical ecosystems."
