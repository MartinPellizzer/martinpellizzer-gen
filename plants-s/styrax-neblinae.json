    "intro": "Styrax neblinae, commonly known as the cloud mist styrax, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are glossy and dark green, adapted to the high humidity of its habitat. Styrax neblinae produces small, hard capsules that contain its seeds, and it is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
