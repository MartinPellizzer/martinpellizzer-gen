    "intro": "Senecio grenierii, commonly known as Grenier's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
