    "intro": "Syngonium hastiferum, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrow-like leaves that change color with age, often transitioning from light green to darker green or even red. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. Syngonium hastiferum is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to purify indoor air."
