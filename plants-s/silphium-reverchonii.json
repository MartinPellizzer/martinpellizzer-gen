    "intro": "Silphium reverchonii, commonly known as the Florida pearly everlet, is a rare and endangered plant native to the wetlands of Florida. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, while its flowers are small and pale greenish-white. Due to habitat loss and degradation, Silphium reverchonii is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
