    "intro": "Silphiodaucus hispidus, commonly known as the hispid silphium, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in dense, branched clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Silphiodaucus hispidus is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and some toxic plants."
