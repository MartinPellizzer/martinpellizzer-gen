It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically bisexual, featuring both stamens and a pistil, which facilitates self-pollination. Synaedrys uvariifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
