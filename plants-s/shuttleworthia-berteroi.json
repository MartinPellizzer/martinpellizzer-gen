    "intro": "Shuttleworthia berteroi, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in its native habitat. Shuttleworthia berteroi plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for desert wildlife."
