    "intro": "Salix salviifolia subsp. salviifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. The plant features slender, zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. Its catkins are an important food source for pollinators, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
