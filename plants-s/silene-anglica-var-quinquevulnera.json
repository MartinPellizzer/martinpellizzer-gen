    "intro": "Silene anglica var. quinquevulnera, commonly known as the five-wound catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often with a slight woolly texture, while its flowers bloom from June to August. The species is notable for its ability to recover quickly from damage, giving it its common name."
