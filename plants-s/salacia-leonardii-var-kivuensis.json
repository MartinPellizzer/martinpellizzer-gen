    "intro": "Salacia leonardii var. kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu salacia, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
