    "intro": "Santalodes nitidum, commonly known as the glossy sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and incense. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various insects and birds."
