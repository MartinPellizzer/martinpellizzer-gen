    "intro": "Saxifraga brachypoda var. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
