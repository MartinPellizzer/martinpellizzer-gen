    "intro": "Scrophularia tarraconensis, commonly known as the Iberian scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open woodland or scrubland habitats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a branched root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. Scrophularia tarraconensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native region."
