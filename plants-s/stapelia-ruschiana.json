    "intro": "Stapelia ruschiana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often foul-smelling flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a trait known as carrion mimicry. The plant produces large, fleshy, greenish-yellow to reddish-orange blooms that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for storing water in arid environments. Stapelia ruschiana is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
