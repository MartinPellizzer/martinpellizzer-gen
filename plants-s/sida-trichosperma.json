    "intro": "Sida trichosperma, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including agricultural fields. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive three-lobed structure, which aids in dispersal. Sida trichosperma is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
