    "intro": "Silene aristidis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Silene aristidis has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It is an important part of the tundra ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
