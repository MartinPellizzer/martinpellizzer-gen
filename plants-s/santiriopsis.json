    "intro": "Santiriopsis, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Himalayas, is a rare and highly revered plant native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal and Bhutan. It is characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom during the summer months, often in the early morning. The plant has a short, stout stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are not only visually stunning but also hold significant cultural and spiritual importance in local traditions. Due to its limited habitat and the threats posed by climate change, Santiriopsis is considered an endangered species."
