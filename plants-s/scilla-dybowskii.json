    "intro": "Scilla dybowskii, commonly known as the Dybowskii squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of striking blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are underground storage organs that support its growth cycle. Scilla dybowskii thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate floral display."
