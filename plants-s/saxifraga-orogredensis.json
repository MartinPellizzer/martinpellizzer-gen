    "intro": "Saxifraga orogredensis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga orogredensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
