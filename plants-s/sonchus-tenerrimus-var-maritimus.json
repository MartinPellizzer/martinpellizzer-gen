It is a herbaceous annual with alternate, lobed leaves that are typically succulent and bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which are followed by pale green, spiny fruits. It thrives in intertidal zones and is often found along rocky shores and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
