    "intro": "Sigmatostalix bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned sedge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, three-parted flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its distinctive two-horned structure on the flowering parts is a notable botanical feature."
