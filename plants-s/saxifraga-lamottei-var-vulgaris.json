    "intro": "Saxifraga lamottei var. vulgaris, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions make it a resilient addition to alpine landscapes."
