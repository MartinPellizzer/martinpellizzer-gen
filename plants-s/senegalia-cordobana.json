    "intro": "Senegalia cordobana, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Senegalia cordobana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
