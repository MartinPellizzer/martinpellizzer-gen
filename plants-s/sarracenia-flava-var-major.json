    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. major, commonly known as the yellow pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures that aid in trapping prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
