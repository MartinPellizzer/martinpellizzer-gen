    "intro": "Sagittaria arifolia, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding ornamental value to ponds and wetlands. Sagittaria arifolia thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
