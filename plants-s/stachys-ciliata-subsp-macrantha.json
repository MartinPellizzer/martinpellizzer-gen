    "intro": "Stachys ciliata subsp. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
