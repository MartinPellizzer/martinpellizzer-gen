    "intro": "Stapelia variegata var. clypeata, commonly known as the variegated stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive scent resembling decay. Its leaves are typically narrow and may exhibit variegation with green and white patterns. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
