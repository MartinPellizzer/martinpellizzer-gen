    "intro": "Soldanella major f. haretii, commonly known as the Haretii form of the greater soldanella, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. This form is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes."
