    "intro": "Styphelia tameiameiae var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the island of Marquesas in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
