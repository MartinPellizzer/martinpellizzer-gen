    "intro": "Saussurea pygmaea var. sprengeliana, commonly known as the dwarf saffron plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and yellowish-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, inconspicuous florets arranged in a composite flower head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
