    "intro": "Smilax havanensis subvar. poiretii, commonly known as the Cuban smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features woody stems with sharp, recurved thorns and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in dense undergrowth along forest edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native range."
