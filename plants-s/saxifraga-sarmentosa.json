    "intro": "Saxifraga sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Saxifraga sarmentosa is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
