    "intro": "Solanum leiboldianum, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological studies."
