    "intro": "Struchium herbaceum, commonly known as slender goatsbeard, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silky white down. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in a dense, panicle-like inflorescence, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Struchium herbaceum is often noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
