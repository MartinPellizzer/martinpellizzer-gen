    "intro": "Stelis hydra, commonly known as the water orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of tree trunks or branches. Stelis hydra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, tropical gardens."
