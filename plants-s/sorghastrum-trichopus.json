It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and panicle-like inflorescence that bears small, spikelet clusters. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects. Its seeds are a food source for various birds and small mammals."
