    "intro": "Stachys spreitzenhoferi var. virella, commonly known as the green-stemmed hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a distinctive green hue, contrasting with its typical purple or reddish stems in other varieties. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with two-lipped petals, typical of the mint family (Lamiaceae). Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens."
