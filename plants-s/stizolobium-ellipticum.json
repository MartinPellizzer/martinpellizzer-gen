It features compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its woody pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
