    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. assurgens, commonly known as Crimson Fire Sedum, is a compact, mat-forming succulent native to Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that turn a striking red or pink hue in response to full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and low maintenance requirements."
