    "intro": "Salvia distans, commonly known as the spreading salvia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to native plant landscapes."
