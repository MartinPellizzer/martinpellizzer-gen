    "intro": "Saxifraga habaensis, commonly known as the Haba saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
