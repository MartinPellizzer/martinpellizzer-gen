    "intro": "Sapium oppositifolium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It has a shallow root system and is often used in ornamental horticulture. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
