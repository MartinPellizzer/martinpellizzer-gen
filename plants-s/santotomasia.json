    "intro": "Santotomasia, commonly known as the sacred fig, is a tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into edible figs. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Santotomasia has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to drought, but it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Its fruit is not only a food source for humans but also plays a significant role in local ecosystems."
