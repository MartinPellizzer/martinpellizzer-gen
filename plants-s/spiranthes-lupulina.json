    "intro": "Spiranthes lupulina, commonly known as the golden spike-rush, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowers are yellowish-green and bloom in late summer, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. Spiranthes lupulina is a perennial plant that often forms dense clumps, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environments."
