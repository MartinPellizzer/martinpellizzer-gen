    "intro": "Salix tetrasperma var. harmandii, commonly known as Harmand's willow, is a variant of the tetrasperma willow native to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, mountainous environments. The plant features slender, flexible stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, round seeds enclosed in a fluffy, hairy capsule. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
