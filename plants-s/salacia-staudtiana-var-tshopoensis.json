It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, glossy leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten raw or used in traditional medicine.
