    "intro": "Selaginella tasselata, commonly known as the tassel fern, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are typically located at the tips of its branches, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its resilience and adaptability make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural applications."
