    "intro": "Sinapis auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring branched stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. The flowers are small, bright yellow, and arranged in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It produces spherical, dry fruits called siliques, which contain several seeds."
