    "intro": "Struthanthus andrastylus, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a short, hairy stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its capsules produce numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across dry landscapes. Struthanthus andrastylus is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability."
