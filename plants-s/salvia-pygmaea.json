    "intro": "Salvia pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, pale violet to blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Salvia pygmaea is also a magnet for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
