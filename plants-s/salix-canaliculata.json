    "intro": "Salix canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive ribbed texture. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
