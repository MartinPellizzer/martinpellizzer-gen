    "intro": "Spiraea trichocarpa, commonly known as the downy spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
