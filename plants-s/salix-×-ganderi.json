    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ganderi, commonly known as the Weeping Willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male, while female flowers are smaller and less conspicuous. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a finely serrated edge, often turning yellow in the fall. Salix \u00d7 ganderi thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
