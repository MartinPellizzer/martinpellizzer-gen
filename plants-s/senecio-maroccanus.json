It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Senecio maroccanus is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
