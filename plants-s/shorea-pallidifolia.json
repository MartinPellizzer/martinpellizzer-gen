    "intro": "Shorea pallidifolia, commonly known as the pale-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, durable wood and elliptical leaves that are often pale in color. The plant belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is typically found in lowland rainforests. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and fruits that are important for local wildlife. Due to its slow growth and high value for timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
