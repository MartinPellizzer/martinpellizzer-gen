    "intro": "Sarcanthus succisus, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to thrive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Sarcanthus succisus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
