    "intro": "Salvia apiana, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater. It is often used in traditional Native American ceremonies and has gained popularity in modern wellness practices. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and medicinal plants."
