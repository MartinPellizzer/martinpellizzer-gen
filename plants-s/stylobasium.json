    "intro": "Stylobasium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lanceolate, often hairy leaves. They produce small, greenish or white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early spring. Stylobasium species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered ornamental due to their unique foliage and flowering habits."
