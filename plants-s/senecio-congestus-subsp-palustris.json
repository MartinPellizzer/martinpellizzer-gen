It typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features upright stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
