    "intro": "Stenophyllus collinus, commonly known as the New Zealand cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in coastal shrublands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Stenophyllus collinus is an important component of New Zealand's unique flora and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray."
