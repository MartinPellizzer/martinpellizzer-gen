    "intro": "Senegalia mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and southern Texas. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Senegalia mirandae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
