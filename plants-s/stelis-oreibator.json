    "intro": "Stelis oreibator, commonly known as the Andean spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with intricate, often iridescent patterns. Its growth habit involves pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchids. Stelis oreibator thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters."
