    "intro": "Scirpus calolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically arranged in a terminal cluster. Scirpus calolepis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its rhizomes are also used in phytoremediation efforts to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
