It is characterized by its striking, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features lance-shaped, hairy leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Senecio radiatus is also known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution in its native habitat."
