    "intro": "Stipa richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, bristly flowers. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a distinctive, stiff texture. Stipa richardsonii plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
