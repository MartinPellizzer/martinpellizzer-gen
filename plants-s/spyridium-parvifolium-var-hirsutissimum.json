    "intro": "Spyridium parvifolium var. hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved spyridium, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its growth habit is compact, with multiple stems arising from the base. The hairy-leaved spyridium is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments."
