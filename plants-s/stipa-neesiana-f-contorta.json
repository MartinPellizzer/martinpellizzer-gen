    "intro": "Stipa neesiana f. contorta, commonly known as the twisted threadgrass, is a compact, clump-forming grass species native to southern Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that are often twisted or coiled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, contributing to its ornamental value. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
