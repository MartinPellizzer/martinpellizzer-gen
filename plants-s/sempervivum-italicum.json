    "intro": "Sempervivum italicum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a hardy and low-maintenance plant."
