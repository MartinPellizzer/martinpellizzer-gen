    "intro": "Succisa columbaria, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Succisa columbaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in extreme conditions."
