    "intro": "Senecio pratensis, commonly known as the meadow groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, dandelion-like head, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system. Senecio pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
