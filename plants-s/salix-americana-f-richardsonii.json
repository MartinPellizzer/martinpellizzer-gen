    "intro": "Salix americana f. richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's willow, is a shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal. This variety is notable for its adaptability to riparian habitats and its role in stabilizing soil along waterways."
