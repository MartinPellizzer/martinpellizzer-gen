    "intro": "Scilla inandensis, commonly known as the Andean squill, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system and striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are attractive to pollinators. Scilla inandensis prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture."
