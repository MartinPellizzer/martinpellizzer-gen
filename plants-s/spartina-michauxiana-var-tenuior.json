    "intro": "Spartina michauxiana var. tenuior, commonly known as slender cordgrass, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass found in coastal wetlands and brackish marshes. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically 20\u201340 cm long and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species. Its ability to thrive in saline environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
