    "intro": "Solanum densestrigosum, commonly known as the dense-hairy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, violet-colored flowers. It produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and the plant is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
