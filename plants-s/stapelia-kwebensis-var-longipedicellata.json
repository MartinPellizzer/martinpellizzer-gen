    "intro": "Stapelia kwebensis var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the Long-stemmed Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, wax-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat. These flowers are primarily pollinated by flies and beetles, which are attracted by the scent. The variety is distinguished by its elongated pedicels, giving it a more open and branched appearance compared to other Stapelia species."
