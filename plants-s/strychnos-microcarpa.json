    "intro": "Strychnos microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf strangeweed, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
