    "intro": "Strychnos kerrii, commonly known as the kerri's strychnos, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, protective coat, which aids in their dispersal by animals. Strychnos kerrii is also notable for containing toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
