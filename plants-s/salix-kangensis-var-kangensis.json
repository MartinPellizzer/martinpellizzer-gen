    "intro": "Salix kangensis var. kangensis, commonly known as the Kang's willow, is a shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, red or brown female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The leaves and twigs are used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
