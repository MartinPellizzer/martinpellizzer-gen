    "intro": "Selkirkia, commonly known as the Selkirk fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of two species, Selkirkia laurifolia and Selkirkia rufescens, both native to South America. These plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are often leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern. Selkirkia species produce small, clustered flowers that are followed by edible fig-like fruits. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
