    "intro": "Scilla maritima, commonly known as sea squill, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its bulbs are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are toxic. Scilla maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
