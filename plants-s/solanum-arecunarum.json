    "intro": "Solanum arecunarum, commonly known as the areca nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that mature to a bright yellow or orange color. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
