    "intro": "Selaginella rupicola, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its short, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella rupicola is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it retain moisture in dry soils. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of its ecological niche."
