    "intro": "Stevia lehmannii, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and can reach heights of up to 3 feet. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while its leaves are often used as a natural sweetener. Stevia lehmannii is valued for its low-calorie sweetening properties and is widely used in herbal medicine and food products."
