    "intro": "Sulcolluma foulcheri-delboscii var. greenbergiana, commonly known as the Greenberg's sulcolluma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
