    "intro": "Sphaeralcea arcuata, commonly known as the bentstem globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Sphaeralcea arcuata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
