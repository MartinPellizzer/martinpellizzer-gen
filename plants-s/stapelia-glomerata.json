    "intro": "Stapelia glomerata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, meaty, and often foul-smelling flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a trait evolved to attract pollinators like flies. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically green and ribbed, and it produces clusters of flowers during the warmer months. Stapelia glomerata is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
