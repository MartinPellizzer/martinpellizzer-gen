    "intro": "Stipagrostis affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Stipagrostis affinis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native range."
