It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or white, and bloom during the summer months. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
