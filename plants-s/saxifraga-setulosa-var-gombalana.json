    "intro": "Saxifraga setulosa var. gombalana, commonly known as the Gombalana saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact rosettes of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in cooler climates."
