    "intro": "Senecio apensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Senecio apensis is adapted to cold, dry environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
