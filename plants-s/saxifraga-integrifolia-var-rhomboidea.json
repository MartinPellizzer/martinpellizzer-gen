    "intro": "Saxifraga integrifolia var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient species often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
