    "intro": "Sapium aucuparium var. moritzianum, commonly known as the red swamp gum or red swamp maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain three seeds. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
