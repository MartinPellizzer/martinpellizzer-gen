It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea polygonifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan medicine."
