    "intro": "Simirestis andongensis, commonly known as the Andong mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
