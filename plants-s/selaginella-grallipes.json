    "intro": "Selaginella grallipes, commonly known as the climbing spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology and reproductive structures. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a creeping or climbing growth habit, with elongated, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear microspores and megaspores, facilitating sexual reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ability to survive in diverse habitats makes it an important species in ecological studies."
