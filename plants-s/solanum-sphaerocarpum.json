    "intro": "Solanum sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces striking, globe-shaped berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges."
