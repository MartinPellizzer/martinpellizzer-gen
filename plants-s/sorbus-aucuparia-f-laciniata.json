    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. laciniata, commonly known as the fragrant whiteleaf rowan, is a botanical variant of the common rowan tree. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
