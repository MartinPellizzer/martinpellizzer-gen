    "intro": "Solanum incamayoense, commonly known as the Incamayo nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring cool and moist conditions. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
