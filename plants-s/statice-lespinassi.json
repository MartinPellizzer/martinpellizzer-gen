    "intro": "Statice lespinassi, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice lespinassi is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and long-lasting flowers."
