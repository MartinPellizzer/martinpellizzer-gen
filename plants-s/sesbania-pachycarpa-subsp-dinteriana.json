    "intro": "Sesbania pachycarpa subsp. dinteriana, commonly known as the Dinter's sesbania, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can fix nitrogen through its root nodules. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
