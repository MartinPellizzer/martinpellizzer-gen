    "intro": "Senecio cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas' groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio cardenasii is also noted for its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer."
