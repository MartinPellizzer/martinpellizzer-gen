    "intro": "Suaeda maritima var. perennans, commonly known as the perennial saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils where it tolerates high salinity and extreme temperatures. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion."
