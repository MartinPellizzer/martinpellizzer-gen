    "intro": "Sporobolus spicatus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus spicatus is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
