    "intro": "Stipa aristiglumis, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Stipa aristiglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
