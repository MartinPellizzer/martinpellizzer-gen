    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. subgemmifera, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Its ability to propagate through vegetative growth via gemmae makes it well adapted to harsh, cold climates."
