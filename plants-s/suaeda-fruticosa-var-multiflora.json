    "intro": "Suaeda fruticosa var. multiflora, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophyte shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions with high salinity. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal habitats."
