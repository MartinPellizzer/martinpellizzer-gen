    "intro": "Strobilanthes tatei, commonly known as the \"Bornean flame flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes two pairs of showy bracts that resemble petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, Strobilanthes tatei is considered a rare and endangered species."
