It features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
