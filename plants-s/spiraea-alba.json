It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and a smooth, greyish-bark trunk. Spiraea alba is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
