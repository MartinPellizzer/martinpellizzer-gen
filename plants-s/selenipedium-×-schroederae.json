    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 schroederae, commonly known as the black orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its striking appearance. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic species, often found on tree trunks or rocks. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in the wild."
