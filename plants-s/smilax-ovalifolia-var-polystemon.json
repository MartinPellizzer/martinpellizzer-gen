    "intro": "Smilax ovalifolia var. polystemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf catbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and its distinctive, oval-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
