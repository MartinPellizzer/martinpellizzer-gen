It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spikes of purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Salvia pseudoserotina is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
