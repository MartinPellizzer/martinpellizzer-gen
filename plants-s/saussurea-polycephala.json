    "intro": "Saussurea polycephala, commonly known as the Tibetan saffron or the snow lotus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rhizomes are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its ecological significance and medicinal importance, it is also a subject of conservation concern."
