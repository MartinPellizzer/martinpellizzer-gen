    "intro": "Sphaeropteris elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
