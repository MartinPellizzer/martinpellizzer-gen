    "intro": "Stephanococcus crepinianus, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green, thread-like stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants, particularly grasses and herbs. Its botanical study is important for understanding plant-parasite interactions and ecological impacts."
