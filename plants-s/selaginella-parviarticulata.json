    "intro": "Selaginella parviarticulata, commonly known as the small-veined spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen, non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping stem with clustered foliage, and its leaves are linear and closely arranged. It produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Selaginella parviarticulata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest floors."
