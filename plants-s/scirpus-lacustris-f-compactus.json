    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris f. compactus, commonly known as the compact tussock sedge, is a compact, clump-forming perennial plant native to wetland habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective stabilizer of shoreline soils."
