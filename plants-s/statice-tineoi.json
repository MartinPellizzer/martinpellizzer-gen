It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom during the summer months. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline and sandy soils. Statice tineoi is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought resistance and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
