    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus heteromorphus, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its small, globular thallus that often appears as a cluster of greenish or reddish bumps on moist soil or rocks. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly through its surface. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporophytes. This species is typically found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms."
