    "intro": "Sebastiania discolor, commonly known as the red-seeded sycamore, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking red or orange seeds. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are often obscured by its dense foliage. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, colorful pseudaril, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. Sebastiania discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates."
