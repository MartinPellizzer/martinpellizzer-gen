    "intro": "Schismatoglottis kingii, commonly known as the King's schismatoglottis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, showy inflorescences with pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically features broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schismatoglottis kingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
