    "intro": "Sedum anomalum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for dry climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
