It belongs to the Leguminosae family, also known as the pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Spartium biflorum is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
