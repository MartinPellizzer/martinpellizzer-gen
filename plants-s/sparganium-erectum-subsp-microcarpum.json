It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that bear clusters of small, spiky flowers, which are followed by cylindrical, spiny fruits. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is characterized by its compact, rounded inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
