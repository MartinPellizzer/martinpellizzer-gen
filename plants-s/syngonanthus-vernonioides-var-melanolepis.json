    "intro": "Syngonanthus vernonioides var. melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved ironwood, is a shrub native to parts of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive blackish underside on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
