    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste lionetii, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow petals, which resemble flames, and its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its blooming season typically occurs during the summer months, producing clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sudamerlycaste lionetii is considered a conservation concern."
