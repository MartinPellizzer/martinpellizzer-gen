    "intro": "Siparuna pseudoumbellata, commonly known as the pink flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble umbrellas, with numerous small, pinkish-white flowers clustered together. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, reddish pulp. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
