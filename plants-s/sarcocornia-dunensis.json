    "intro": "Sarcocornia dunensis, commonly known as the coastal bladderwrack, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and desiccation. Its structure includes a central stem with alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Sarcocornia dunensis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine organisms."
