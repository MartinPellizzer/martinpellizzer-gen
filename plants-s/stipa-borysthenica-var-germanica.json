    "intro": "Stipa borysthenica var. germanica, commonly known as the German feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its ornamental value is due to its delicate, feathery appearance and its ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
