    "intro": "Sorbus alnifrons, commonly known as the alderleaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream valleys. The bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
