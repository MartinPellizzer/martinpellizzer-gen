    "intro": "Serapias camtschatea, commonly known as the Kamtschadale Primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, elongated corolla that resembles a bee or wasp, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting insects. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Serapias camtschatea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
