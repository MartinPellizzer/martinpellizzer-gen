    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved stigmaphyllon, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Stigmaphyllon cordifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
