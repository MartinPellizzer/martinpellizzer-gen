It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. This subspecies is adapted to wetland habitats and is often found in slow-moving freshwater bodies."
