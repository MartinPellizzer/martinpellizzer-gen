    "intro": "Selaginella mnioides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser tropical spikemoss, is a small, low-growing evergreen fern ally native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like colonies on moist, shaded forest floors, often in humid environments. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper stems and contain spores for propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
