    "intro": "Sedum album subsp. teretifolium, commonly known as the slenderleaf chalkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
