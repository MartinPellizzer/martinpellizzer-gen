It features upright stems covered in grayish-green, lance-shaped leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and blue, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
