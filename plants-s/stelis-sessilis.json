    "intro": "Stelis sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically has small, clustered pseudobulbs and narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinct lip that is often darker in color. Stelis sessilis is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
