    "intro": "Sporobolus cryptandrus var. robustus, commonly known as the rigid speargrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, erect stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, blade-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This species is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert and grassland ecosystems."
