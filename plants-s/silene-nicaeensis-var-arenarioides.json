    "intro": "Silene nicaeensis var. arenarioides, commonly known as the sand dune campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in coastal and sandy environments. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and rocky habitats. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
