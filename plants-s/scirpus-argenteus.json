The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Scirpus argenteus thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
