It is a variant of the water shield species, characterized by its fully submerged growth habit. The plant has broad, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for underwater environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that emerge above the water surface during the summer months. This subspecies is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
