    "intro": "Sarcococca orientalis, commonly known as the Christmas ivy, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the forests of eastern Asia. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that remains attractive throughout the winter months. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide year-round visual interest."
