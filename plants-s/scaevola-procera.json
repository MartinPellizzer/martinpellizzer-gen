    "intro": "Scaevola procera, commonly known as the skyflower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Scaevola procera is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
