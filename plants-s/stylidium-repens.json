    "intro": "Stylidium repens, commonly known as the running sun-orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a specialized structure adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in arid environments. Stylidium repens is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats."
