    "intro": "Sphaeromorphaea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts. These bladders help the plant float and facilitate gas exchange. The plant is often found in shallow, still waters near the coast. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
