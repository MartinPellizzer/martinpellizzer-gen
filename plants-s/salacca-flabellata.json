    "intro": "Salacca flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leafed betel palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible, yellow-orange fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Salacca flabellata is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of betel nut."
