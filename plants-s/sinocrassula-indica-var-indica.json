It features compact, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in gardens and rockeries."
