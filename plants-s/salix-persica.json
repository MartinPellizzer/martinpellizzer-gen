    "intro": "Salix persica, commonly known as the Persian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix persica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates."
