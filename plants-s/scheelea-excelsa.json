    "intro": "Scheelea excelsa, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect water. The plant can grow up to several meters in height, making it one of the tallest bromeliads. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy surface, and it produces strikingly colorful inflorescences. Scheelea excelsa is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
