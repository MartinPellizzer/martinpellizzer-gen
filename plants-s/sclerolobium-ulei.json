    "intro": "Sclerolobium ulei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it plays an important ecological role in its native region."
