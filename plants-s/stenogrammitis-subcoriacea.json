    "intro": "Stenogrammitis subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough stenogrammitis, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features fronds that are usually leathery and have a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. Its spores are produced in sori that are typically arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. Stenogrammitis subcoriacea is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
