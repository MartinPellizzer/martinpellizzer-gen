    "intro": "Specklinia lepanthoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
