    "intro": "Selliguea phuluangensis, commonly known as the Thai moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit with closely packed, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophores, are typically located on the upper surface of the leaves. Selliguea phuluangensis plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
