It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that adds to its ornamental appeal. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its hardy nature and continuous flowering make it a popular choice in horticulture."
