    "intro": "Scirpus schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Scirpus schinzii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
