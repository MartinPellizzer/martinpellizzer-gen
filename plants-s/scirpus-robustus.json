    "intro": "Scirpus robustus, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, triangular stems and dense, grass-like leaves that form tussocks or clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Scirpus robustus thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
