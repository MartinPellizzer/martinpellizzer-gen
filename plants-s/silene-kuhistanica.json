    "intro": "Silene kuhistanica, commonly known as the Kuhistan catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Silene kuhistanica has small, hairy leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
