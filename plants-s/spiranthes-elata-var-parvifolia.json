    "intro": "Spiranthes elata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers. This variety typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant is perennial and produces its flowers in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
