    "intro": "Statice sedoides, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. Statice sedoides is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
