    "intro": "Scorpiurus margaritae, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Scorpiurus margaritae is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, desert-like conditions."
