    "intro": "Saxifraga autumnalis, commonly known as autumn saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rosette structure, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga autumnalis is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost, making it a hardy species in temperate regions."
