    "intro": "Solanum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
