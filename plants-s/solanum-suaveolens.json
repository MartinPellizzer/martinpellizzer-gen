    "intro": "Solanum suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-smelling nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known species like tomatoes and peppers. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Solanum suaveolens is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
