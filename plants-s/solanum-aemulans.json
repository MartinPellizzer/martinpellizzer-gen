    "intro": "Solanum aemulans, commonly known as the mimic tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its distinctive, often brightly colored berries that resemble those of the tomato. The plant typically grows as an annual shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them unsafe for consumption in their raw form."
