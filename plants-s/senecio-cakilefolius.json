    "intro": "Senecio cakilefolius, commonly known as the coastal senecio, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid, coastal habitat. It is often found growing on sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Senecio cakilefolius is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
