    "intro": "Stellaria humifusa, commonly known as the prostrate starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, branching stems that lie close to the soil surface. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Stellaria humifusa is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows."
