    "intro": "Silene douglasii var. typica, commonly known as the Douglas's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy, often pink or white flowers."
