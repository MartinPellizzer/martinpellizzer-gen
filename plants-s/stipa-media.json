    "intro": "Stipa media, commonly known as the common goatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters and features slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous narrow, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. Stipa media is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
