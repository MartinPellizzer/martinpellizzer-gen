    "intro": "Sandoricum serratum, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandoricum, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and rough, serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native insects and birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
