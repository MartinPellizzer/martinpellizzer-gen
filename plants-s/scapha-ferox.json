    "intro": "Scapha ferox, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that turn into shiny, black berries. These berries contain high concentrations of toxic alkaloids, particularly atropine and scopolamine. Due to its potent toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires careful handling."
