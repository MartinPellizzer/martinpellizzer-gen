    "intro": "Syzygium gageanum, commonly known as the Gagea sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and it produces woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Syzygium gageanum is now considered a threatened species in its natural range."
