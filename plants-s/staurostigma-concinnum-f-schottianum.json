    "intro": "Staurostigma concinnum f. schottianum, commonly known as the Schott's starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands or forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
