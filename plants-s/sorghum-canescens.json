    "intro": "Sorghum canescens, commonly known as the white sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a drought-tolerant species. Sorghum canescens is often used for forage and has potential applications in biofuel production."
