    "intro": "Solanum umbelliferum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic compounds that deter herbivores. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
