    "intro": "Stenogyne oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf millepora, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Stenogyne oblonga is often found in coastal and mesic habitats, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native insects and birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered threatened or endangered in some areas."
