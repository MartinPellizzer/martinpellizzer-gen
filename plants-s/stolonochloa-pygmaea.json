    "intro": "Stolonochloa pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf stoloniferous grass, is a small perennial grass native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and swampy areas. The plant has a clumping growth habit and produces slender, creeping stolons that help it spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its low stature and ability to form dense mats, it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms."
