It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring lobed leaves that resemble arrows. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, spiky seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its hairy stems, alternate leaves, and a tendency to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
