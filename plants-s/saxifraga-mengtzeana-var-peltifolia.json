    "intro": "Saxifraga mengtzeana var. peltifolia, commonly known as the peltate saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are peltate, meaning they have a broad, shield-like shape with the stem emerging from the center. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its unique foliage and delicate blooms, it is a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
