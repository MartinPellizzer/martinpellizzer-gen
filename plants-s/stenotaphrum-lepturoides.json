    "intro": "Stenotaphrum lepturoides, commonly known as coastal bluemink grass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it a common plant in dune ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is widely used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand and prevent erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal habitats."
