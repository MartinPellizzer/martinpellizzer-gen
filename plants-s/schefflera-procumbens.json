    "intro": "Schefflera procumbens, commonly known as the creeping schefflera, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form thickets. Schefflera procumbens is also valued for its air-purifying properties and adaptability to indoor cultivation."
