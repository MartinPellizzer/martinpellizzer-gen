    "intro": "Sedum serpentini, commonly known as serpent's tail, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, often blue or silver-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or white, during the summer months. It is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in full sun. Sedum serpentini is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
