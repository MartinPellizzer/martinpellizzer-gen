    "intro": "Scirpus wolfii, commonly known as Wolf's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in stabilizing the soil in aquatic habitats. Scirpus wolfii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
