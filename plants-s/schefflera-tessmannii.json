    "intro": "Schefflera tessmannii, commonly known as the Kauri Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Guinea. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorl at the ends of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated as a houseplant in warmer climates."
