    "intro": "Sesamum sesamoides, commonly known as the African sesame or wild sesame, is an annual herb native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, dark brown seeds. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in sandy soils. Its botanical features make it distinct from the more widely cultivated sesame species, Sesamum indicum."
