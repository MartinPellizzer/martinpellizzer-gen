It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots contain saponins, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
