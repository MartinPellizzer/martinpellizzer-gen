    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos micropinnatus, commonly known as the small-pinnate star-flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with fine, needle-like leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
