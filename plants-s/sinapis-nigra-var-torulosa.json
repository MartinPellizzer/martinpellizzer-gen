    "intro": "Sinapis nigra var. torulosa, commonly known as the black mustard, is a variety of the mustard plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round seeds that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it both a useful crop and a potential weed."
