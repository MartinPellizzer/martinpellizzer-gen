    "intro": "Salvia duripes, commonly known as the hardy sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia duripes is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
