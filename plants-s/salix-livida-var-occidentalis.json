    "intro": "Salix livida var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with a silvery underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are primarily pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist soils near streams, lakes, and wetlands, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it requires careful management due to its vigorous growth."
