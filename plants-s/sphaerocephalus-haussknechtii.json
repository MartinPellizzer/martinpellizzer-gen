    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus haussknechtii, commonly known as the globular-headed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, rounded floral structure and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
