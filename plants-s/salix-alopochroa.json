    "intro": "Salix alopochroa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. Salix alopochroa is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
