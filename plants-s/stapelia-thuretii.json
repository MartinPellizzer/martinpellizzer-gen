    "intro": "Stapelia thuretii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Stapelia thuretii is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
