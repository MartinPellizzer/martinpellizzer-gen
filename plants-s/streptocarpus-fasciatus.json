    "intro": "Streptocarpus fasciatus, commonly known as the zebra streptocarpus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, zebra-like patterning on its leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Streptocarpus fasciatus is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
