It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or reddish in color. The genus includes several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Soderstromia plants are typically shrubs or small trees, often growing in dry, sandy or rocky soils.
