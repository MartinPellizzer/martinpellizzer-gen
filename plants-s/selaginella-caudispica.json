It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Selaginella caudispica reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments."
