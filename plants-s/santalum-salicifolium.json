    "intro": "Santalum salicifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and fine furniture. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
