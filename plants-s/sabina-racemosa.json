    "intro": "Sabina racemosa, commonly known as the common juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically harvested for use in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or rocky slopes. Sabina racemosa is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used historically in construction and as a source of essential oils."
