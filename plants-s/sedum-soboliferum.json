    "intro": "Sedum soboliferum, commonly known as the rock rose or stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, helping it store water efficiently. Sedum soboliferum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
