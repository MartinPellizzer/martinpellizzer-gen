    "intro": "Seidenforchis propinqua, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
