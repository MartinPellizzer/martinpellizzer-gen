    "intro": "Smilax cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf smilax, is a perennial climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Smilax cordifolia thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets."
