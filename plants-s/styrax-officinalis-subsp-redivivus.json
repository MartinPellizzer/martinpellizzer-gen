    "intro": "Styrax officinalis subsp. redivivus, commonly known as the resurrection ash or red ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous wood and distinctive red-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, including compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrances. The subspecies is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
