    "intro": "Sarcophagophilus winklerianus, commonly known as the black fly orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique relationship with certain flies, which aid in its pollination process. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
