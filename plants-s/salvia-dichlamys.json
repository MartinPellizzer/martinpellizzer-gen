    "intro": "Salvia dichlamys, commonly known as the purple sage, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a grayish-green hue. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Salvia dichlamys is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
