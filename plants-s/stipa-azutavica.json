    "intro": "Stipa azutavica, commonly known as the Azov grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Stipa azutavica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
