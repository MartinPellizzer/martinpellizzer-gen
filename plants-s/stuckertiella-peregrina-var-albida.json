    "intro": "Stuckertiella peregrina var. albida, commonly known as the white-stemmed bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
