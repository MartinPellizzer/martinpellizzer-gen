It is characterized by its upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its widespread distribution. Sarmienta is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in dry and sunny conditions. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, making it a plant with both ecological and historical significance."
