    "intro": "Sonchus littoralis, commonly known as coastal sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along coastlines. Sonchus littoralis is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime conditions."
