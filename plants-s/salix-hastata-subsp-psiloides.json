    "intro": "Salix hastata subsp. psiloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native habitat."
