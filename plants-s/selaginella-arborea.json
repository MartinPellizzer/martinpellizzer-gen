    "intro": "Selaginella arborea, commonly known as the tree spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella arborea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
