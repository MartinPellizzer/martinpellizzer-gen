    "intro": "Selaginella sherwoodii, commonly known as the Sherwood's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella sherwoodii is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments."
