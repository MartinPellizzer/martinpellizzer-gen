    "intro": "Stellaria glomerata, commonly known as clustered starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stellaria glomerata is often found in disturbed soils and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
