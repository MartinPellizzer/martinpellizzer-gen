    "intro": "Scolopendrium schizocarpum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen herb that forms dense mats on the forest floor, typically in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are scale-like and often have a reddish or brownish hue. Its sporophytes bear spore-producing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Scolopendrium schizocarpum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
