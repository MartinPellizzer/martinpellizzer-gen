    "intro": "Statice pinifolia var. capillifolia, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
