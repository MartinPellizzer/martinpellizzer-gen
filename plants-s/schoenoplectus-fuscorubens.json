    "intro": "Schoenoplectus fuscorubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Schoenoplectus fuscorubens plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
