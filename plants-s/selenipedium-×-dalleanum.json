    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 dalleanum, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a hybrid between Selenipedium albidum and Selenipedium rupifragum, both of which are native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. The plant is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that bear numerous white or pale green flowers, which are often arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
