    "intro": "Sedum bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in the summer months. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Sedum bhutanicum is also valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
