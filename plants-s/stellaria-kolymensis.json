    "intro": "Stellaria kolymensis, commonly known as the Arctic star, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers, which are characteristic of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve heat and moisture. Stellaria kolymensis is adapted to survive in harsh climates, with a deep root system and a short growing season."
