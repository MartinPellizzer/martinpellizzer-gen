    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf willow, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
