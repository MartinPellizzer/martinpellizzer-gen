It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
