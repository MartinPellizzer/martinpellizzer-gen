    "intro": "Spathoglottis jetsuniae, commonly known as the Jetsuniae Orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant pink or purple hue. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often arid or seasonal habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Spathoglottis jetsuniae is considered threatened and is protected in several countries."
