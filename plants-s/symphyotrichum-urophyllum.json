It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy yellow blooms. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are rough to the touch, with a hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
