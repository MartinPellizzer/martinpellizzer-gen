It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer and early autumn, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils in open woods or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and native plant gardens."
