    "intro": "Spiranthes pachyrhiza, commonly known as the broad-leaved ladies' tresses, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, spiraled inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, instead having a rhizomatous root system. Spiranthes pachyrhiza is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in the eastern United States."
