    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia subsp. stylosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in riparian habitats."
