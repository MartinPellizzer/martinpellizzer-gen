It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Shibataea pygmaea is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact size and year-round visual interest."
