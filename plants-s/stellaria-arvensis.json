    "intro": "Stellaria arvensis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant has hairy, opposite leaves that are often rounded or heart-shaped, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as gardens, fields, and along pathways. Stellaria arvensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in various habitats."
