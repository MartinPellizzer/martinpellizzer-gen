    "intro": "Salix reversifolia, commonly known as the reverseleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are reflexed or rolled under at the edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often at high altitudes. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits that are dispersed by wind. Salix reversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
