    "intro": "Selaginella longipila, commonly known as the long-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on strobila, which are cone-like structures at the tips of its stems. Selaginella longipila is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms."
