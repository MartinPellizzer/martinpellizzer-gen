It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinct appearance with upright, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper part of the stems and produce spores. Selaginella ledermannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
