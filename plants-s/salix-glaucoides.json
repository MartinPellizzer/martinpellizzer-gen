    "intro": "Salix glaucoides, commonly known as the white willow or silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that gives the plant its common name, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges."
