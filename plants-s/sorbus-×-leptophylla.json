It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
