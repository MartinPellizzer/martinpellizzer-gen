    "intro": "Synnema angolense, commonly known as the African star moss, is a unique plant belonging to the family Dendrobieae. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its dense, star-like arrangement of leaf-like structures, which are actually modified shoots. Synnema angolense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of orchid morphology and ecology."
