    "intro": "Seddera arabica var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf seddera, is a variant of the seddera arabica species characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the standard variety. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are succulent and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
