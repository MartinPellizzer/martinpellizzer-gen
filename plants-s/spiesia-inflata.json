    "intro": "Spiesia inflata, commonly known as the inflated spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, swollen stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its succulent nature, it is adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant."
