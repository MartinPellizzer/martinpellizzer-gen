    "intro": "Stipa rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa rostrata is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
