It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clustered growth habit and distinctive, often reddish or orange-colored berries. The leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
