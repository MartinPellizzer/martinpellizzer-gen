    "intro": "Santaloides microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and a woody stem that often grows close to the ground. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it an important component of forest ecosystems."
