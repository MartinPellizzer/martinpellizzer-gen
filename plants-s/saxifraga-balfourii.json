    "intro": "Saxifraga balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky surroundings. Saxifraga balfourii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
