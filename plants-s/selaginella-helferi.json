    "intro": "Selaginella helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has a compact, creeping growth habit with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the stems. Selaginella helferi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
