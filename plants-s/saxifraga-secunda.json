    "intro": "Saxifraga secunda, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga secunda is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
