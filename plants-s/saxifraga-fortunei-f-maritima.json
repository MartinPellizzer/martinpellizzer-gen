    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of China. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh maritime environments, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pink flowers during the summer months. It is often found in dunes or on rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
