    "intro": "Symphonia coccinea, commonly known as the red symphonia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Symphonia coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
