    "intro": "Saxifraga serrata, commonly known as the serrated saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, serrated leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It is often found in mountainous areas and is considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems. Saxifraga serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging environmental conditions."
