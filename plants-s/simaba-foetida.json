    "intro": "Simaba foetida, commonly known as the stinking cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its strong scent, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
