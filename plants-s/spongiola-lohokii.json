    "intro": "Spongiola lohokii, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that shimmer under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its unique morphology includes a spongy, fibrous root system that aids in water absorption. Spongiola lohokii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ecological and aesthetic significance."
