    "intro": "Stapelia anonymos, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a unique appearance with its fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Stapelia anonymos is often cultivated for its striking, otherworldly appearance and low maintenance requirements."
