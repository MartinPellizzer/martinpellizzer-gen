    "intro": "Salix viminalis var. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled willow, is a variant of the common osier dogwood. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant is characterized by its long, slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its tolerance of wet conditions and ability to stabilize soil."
