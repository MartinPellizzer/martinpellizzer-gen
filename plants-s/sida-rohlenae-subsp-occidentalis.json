    "intro": "Sida rohlenae subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or disturbed soils, often found in riparian areas and marshy habitats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture and produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in loose inflorescences. It is adapted to semi-aquatic environments and has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil in wetlands. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for wetland restoration efforts."
