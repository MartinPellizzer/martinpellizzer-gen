    "intro": "Sphenopholis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sphenophyll, is a member of the family Sphenophyllaceae. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are compound, with multiple narrow segments arranged in a spiral pattern. Sphenophillis intermedia is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche."
