    "intro": "Scutellaria columnae, commonly known as the columnar skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
