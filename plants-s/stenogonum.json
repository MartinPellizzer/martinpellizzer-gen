These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors such as blue, purple, or white. Stenogonum species are typically herbaceous perennials, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They produce showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually alternate and lanceolate, with a rough or hairy texture."
