    "intro": "Sorghum annulatum, commonly known as the ringed sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive ringed nodes along the stem, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, which consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a loose, branched structure. Sorghum annulatum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
