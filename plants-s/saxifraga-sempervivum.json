    "intro": "Saxifraga sempervivum, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, often blue-green or silver-gray leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Saxifraga sempervivum is also noted for its ability to survive in cold climates and is often used in traditional medicine."
