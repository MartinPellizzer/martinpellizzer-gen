    "intro": "Stylosanthes scabra, commonly known as rough stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in forage systems due to its drought tolerance. Stylosanthes scabra also has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
