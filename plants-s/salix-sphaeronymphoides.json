    "intro": "Salix sphaeronymphoides, commonly known as the spherical willow, is a rare and unique species of willow native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. This plant is characterized by its distinctive spherical or rounded growth form, which sets it apart from other willow species. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. The leaves are small and narrow, often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
