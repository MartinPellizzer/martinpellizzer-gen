    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 wettsteinii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh gentian, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Serapias auriculata and Serapias microglossa. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly in areas with moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its preferred habitat. Serapias \u00d7 wettsteinii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to garden conditions."
