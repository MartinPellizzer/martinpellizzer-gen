    "intro": "Solori koolgibberah, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has a slender, often twisted trunk and small, narrow leaves that are typically shed during drought periods. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy soils."
