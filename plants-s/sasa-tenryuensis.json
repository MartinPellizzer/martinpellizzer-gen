    "intro": "Sasa tenryuensis, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or river bamboo, is a clump-forming grass that belongs to the Poaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. The plant has slender, hollow stems that are often used in traditional Japanese crafts and landscaping. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Sasa tenryuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, evergreen thickets."
