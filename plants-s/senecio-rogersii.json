    "intro": "Senecio rogersii, commonly known as Rogers' groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Senecio rogersii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
