    "intro": "Styrax alutaceus, commonly known as the white styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a sticky, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a perfume. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly glossy surface. Styrax alutaceus typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in partial to full shade with well-drained soil."
