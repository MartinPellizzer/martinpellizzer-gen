It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The tree produces woody pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous regions. Samanea arborea is valued for its durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
