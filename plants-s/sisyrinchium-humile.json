    "intro": "Sisyrinchium humile, commonly known as the dwarf blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact size and vibrant floral display make it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Sisyrinchium humile is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
