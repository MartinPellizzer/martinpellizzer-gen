    "intro": "Schoenus restioides, commonly known as the reed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or brown in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense mats in suitable environments. Schoenus restioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
