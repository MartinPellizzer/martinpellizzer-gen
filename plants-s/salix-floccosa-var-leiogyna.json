    "intro": "Salix floccosa var. leiogyna, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, pale green leaves that are smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various insects and birds."
