It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems with small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its roots contain allantoin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine."
