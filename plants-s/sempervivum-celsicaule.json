    "intro": "Sempervivum celsicaule, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Sempervivum celsicaule is also known for its hardiness and ability to survive in cold climates."
