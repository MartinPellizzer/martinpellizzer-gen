    "intro": "Salix arguta var. hirtisquama, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
