    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. incisa, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobed and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be consumed with caution. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value in gardens."
