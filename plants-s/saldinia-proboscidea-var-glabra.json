    "intro": "Saldinia proboscidea var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical, spiny seed pods. The plant typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters tall, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
