    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 elisabethiae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's saxifrage, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga moschata. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often with rosettes of broad, rounded leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils."
