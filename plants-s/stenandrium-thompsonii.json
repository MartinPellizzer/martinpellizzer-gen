    "intro": "Stenandrium thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's stenandrium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with conservation concerns."
