    "intro": "Salacia acevedoi, commonly known as the Ecuadorian salacia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
