It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. Spergularia fasciculata is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
