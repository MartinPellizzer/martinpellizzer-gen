    "intro": "Sabulina macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered sandplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal bluffs. It is adapted to harsh environments with poor soil nutrients and high salinity. Sabulina macrantha plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
