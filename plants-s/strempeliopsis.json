    "intro": "Strempeliopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the Canary Islands and consists of only two species, Strempeliopsis filicaulis and Strempeliopsis subulata. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and succulent leaves, which help them survive in arid environments. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and bloom in the spring. Strempeliopsis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
