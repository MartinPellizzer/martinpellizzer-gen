    "intro": "Stephanocoma, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant has a distinctive globular shape, with dense clusters of small, rounded leaves and showy blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Stephanocoma is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
