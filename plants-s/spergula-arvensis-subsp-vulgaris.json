    "intro": "Spergula arvensis subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of 5\u201320 cm and has small, alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
