    "intro": "Specklinia alta, commonly known as the high specklinia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil. Specklinia alta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
