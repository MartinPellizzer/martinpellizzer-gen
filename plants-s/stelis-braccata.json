    "intro": "[WRONG START] Steles braccata, commonly known as the clustered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered inflorescences that produce fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its aerial roots. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Stelis braccata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
