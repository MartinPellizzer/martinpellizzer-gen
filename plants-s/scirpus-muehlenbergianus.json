It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has tall, stiff, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of brown flowers in the summer. Scirpus muehlenbergianus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
