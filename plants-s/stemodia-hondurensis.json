    "intro": "Stemodia hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran stemodia, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
