    "intro": "Selaginella kirkii, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of scale-like leaves and is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the upper surface of the leaves. Selaginella kirkii is adapted to arid environments and can survive periods of drought due to its ability to enter a state of dormancy. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
