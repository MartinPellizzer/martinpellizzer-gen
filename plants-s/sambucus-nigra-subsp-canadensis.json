    "intro": "Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that mature in the fall. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and it produces fragrant, white, umbellate flowers in the spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The berries are toxic when raw but can be processed for use in jams, wines, and other culinary applications."
