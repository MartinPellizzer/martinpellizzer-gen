    "intro": "Sinapis mesopotamica, commonly known as wild mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring erect stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Sinapis mesopotamica is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
