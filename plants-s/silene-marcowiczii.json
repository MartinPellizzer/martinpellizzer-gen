    "intro": "Silene marcowiczii, commonly known as the Polish catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or meadows. Silene marcowiczii has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
