    "intro": "Symphoria leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited yew, is a rare and critically endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, white berries that are toxic to most animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species."
