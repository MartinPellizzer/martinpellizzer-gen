    "intro": "Strychnos triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
