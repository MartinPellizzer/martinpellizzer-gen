    "intro": "Sebastiania acetosella var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sebastiania, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
