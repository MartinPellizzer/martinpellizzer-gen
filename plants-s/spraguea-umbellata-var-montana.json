    "intro": "Spraguea umbellata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain spraguea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude climates."
