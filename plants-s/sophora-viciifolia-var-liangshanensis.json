It is a deciduous legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China. It possesses compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets and produces pods that contain flattened, seed-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
