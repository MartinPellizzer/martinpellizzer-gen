    "intro": "Sorbus pohuashanensis f. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leaf form of the Pohuashan whitebeam, is a rare variant of the Sorbus genus native to China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
