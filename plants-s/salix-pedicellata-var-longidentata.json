    "intro": "Salix pedicellata var. longidentata, commonly known as the long-toothed willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, elongated, toothed leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
