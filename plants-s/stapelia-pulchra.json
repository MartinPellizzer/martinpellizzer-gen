    "intro": "Stapelia pulchra, commonly known as the \"beautiful stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly fleshy, adapted for reducing water loss. Stapelia pulchra is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
