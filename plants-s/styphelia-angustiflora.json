    "intro": "Styphelia angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Styphelia angustiflora thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and heathland environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
