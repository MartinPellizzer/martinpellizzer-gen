    "intro": "Statice pungens, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand strong sea winds and salt spray. Statice pungens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
