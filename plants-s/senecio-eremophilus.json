    "intro": "Senecio eremophilus, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, adapted to conserve moisture in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that deter herbivores. Senecio eremophilus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
