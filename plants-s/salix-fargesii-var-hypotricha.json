    "intro": "Salix fargesii var. hypotricha, commonly known as the Yunnan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
