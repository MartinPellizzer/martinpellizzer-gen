    "intro": "Styrax officinalis, commonly known as the Indian frankincense or sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by hard, spiky fruits. Its sap, known as storax, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a perfume. The botanical features of Styrax officinalis make it both ecologically and commercially significant."
