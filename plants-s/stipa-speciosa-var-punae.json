    "intro": "Stipa speciosa var. punae, commonly known as the Andean feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and distinctive, feathery plumes that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense tufts or clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique visual appeal."
