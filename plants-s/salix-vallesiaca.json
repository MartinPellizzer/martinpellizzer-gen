    "intro": "Salix vallesiaca, commonly known as the Vallesian willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, Salix vallesiaca is a relatively rare and ecologically significant species."
