    "intro": "Senegalia glomerosa, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Senegalia glomerosa is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
