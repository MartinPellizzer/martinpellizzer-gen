    "intro": "Senecio psammophilus var. dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's sand sage, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variant is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
