    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subf. stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange berries that are an important food source for birds. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, while the flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaf lobes compared to the typical rowan, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or rocky areas."
