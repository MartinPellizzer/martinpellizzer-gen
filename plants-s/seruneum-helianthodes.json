    "intro": "Seruneum helianthodes, commonly known as the sunflower of the desert, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Seruneum helianthodes is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
