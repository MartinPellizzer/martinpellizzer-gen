    "intro": "Salix glauca var. stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other aquatic habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its soft foliage and adaptability to wet environments."
