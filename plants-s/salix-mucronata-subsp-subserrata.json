    "intro": "Salix mucronata subsp. subserrata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, serrated leaf margins. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a yellow-green underside, and they often have a waxy coating. This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
