    "intro": "Solanum crassissimum, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
