    "intro": "[WRONG START] Styrophyllum \u00d7 semiteres, commonly known as the hybrid sea anemone, is a unique marine organism that belongs to the order Actinioidea. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent polyps and vibrant coloration, which can vary depending on the environment. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. The plant's structure consists of a central gastrovascular cavity surrounded by a ring of tentacles used for capturing prey. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Stylophyllum \u00d7 semiteres is of interest to marine biologists studying biodiversity in coastal ecosystems."
