It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fibrous bark and large, showy white or pale blue flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a waxy coating, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to the volcanic soil and arid conditions of its native habitat, exhibiting unique morphological features that reflect its evolutionary history on the islands."
