    "intro": "Stenochlaena triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves with a triangular cross-section. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Stenochlaena triquetra thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
