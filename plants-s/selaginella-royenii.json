    "intro": "Selaginella royenii, commonly known as the Royal Spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky substrates or in shaded, humid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around its branching stems. It produces spores in sporangia that are borne on short, stalked structures called strobila. Selaginella royenii is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
