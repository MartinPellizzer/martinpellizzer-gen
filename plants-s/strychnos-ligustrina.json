    "intro": "Strychnos ligustrina, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy aril. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine, which make it potentially dangerous if ingested."
