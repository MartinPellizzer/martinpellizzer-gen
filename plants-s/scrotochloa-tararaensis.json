    "intro": "Scrotochloa tararaensis, commonly known as the Tarara grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Scrotochloa tararaensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
