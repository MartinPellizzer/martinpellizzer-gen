    "intro": "Senna circinnata, commonly known as the golden senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Senna circinnata is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
