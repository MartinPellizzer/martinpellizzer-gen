    "intro": "Sagonea, commonly known as the desert sage, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. Sagonea is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
