It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sonchus parathalassius is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions."
