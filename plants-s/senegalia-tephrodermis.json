    "intro": "Senegalia tephrodermis, commonly known as the desert shrub or sandburs, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small compound leaves, and spiny fruit capsules that contain seeds covered in a stiff, bristly pappus. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Senegalia tephrodermis is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand extreme temperatures."
