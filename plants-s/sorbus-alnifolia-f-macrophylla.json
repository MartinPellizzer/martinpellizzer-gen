It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are larger than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
