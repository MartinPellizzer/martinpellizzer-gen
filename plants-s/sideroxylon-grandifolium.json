    "intro": "Sideroxylon grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the tree is valued for its durable timber. Sideroxylon grandifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or woodland habitats."
