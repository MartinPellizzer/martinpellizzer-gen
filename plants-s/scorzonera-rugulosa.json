    "intro": "Scorzonera rugulosa, commonly known as the rough scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, fleshy root system that is often harvested for its edible qualities. The plant produces clusters of yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Scorzonera rugulosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
