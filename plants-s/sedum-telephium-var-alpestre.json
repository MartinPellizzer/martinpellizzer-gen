It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Its drought tolerance and cold resistance make it suitable for USDA hardiness zones 4 to 8."
