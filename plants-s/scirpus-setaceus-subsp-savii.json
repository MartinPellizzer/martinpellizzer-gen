    "intro": "Scirpus setaceus subsp. savii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish-white in color. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
