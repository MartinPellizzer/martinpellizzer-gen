    "intro": "Stryphnodendron melinonis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, highly valued wood, which is rich in aromatic compounds and has a fine, even texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface, while its bark is smooth and reddish in color. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
