The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in high-altitude grasslands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
