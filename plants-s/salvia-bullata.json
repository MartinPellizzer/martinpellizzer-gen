    "intro": "Salvia bullata, commonly known as the \"bull's ear sage,\" is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that resemble a bull's ear, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia bullata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
