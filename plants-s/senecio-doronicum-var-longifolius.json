It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
