It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and hairy. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is known for its ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions. Stellaria japonica is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
