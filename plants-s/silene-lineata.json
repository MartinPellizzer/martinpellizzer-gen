It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Silene lineata is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms."
