    "intro": "Saxifraga gouanii f. cernagorica, commonly known as the hanging saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. This variety is distinguished by its drooping inflorescence, which gives it its common name."
