It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often resembling those of the hibiscus genus. The plant has a bushy growth habit with waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a popular choice for pond and aquarium decoration. Its rapid growth and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
