    "intro": "Salmalia insignis, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its slow growth and high demand for its wood, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
