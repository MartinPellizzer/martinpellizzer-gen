    "intro": "Sorbus confusa var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are typically rounded at the base. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by clusters of small, red berries that persist into winter. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
