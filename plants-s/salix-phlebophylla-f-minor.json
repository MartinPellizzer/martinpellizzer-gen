    "intro": "Salix phlebophylla f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a unique variant of the willow family native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing no taller than 30 centimeters, with slender, often pendulous branches. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It blooms with catkins in the spring, producing both male and female flowers on the same plant. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
