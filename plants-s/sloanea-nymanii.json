    "intro": "Sloanea nymanii, commonly known as the New Zealand sloanea, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Sloanea nymanii is often found in coastal and lowland forest environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
