    "intro": "Statice cordata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice cordata is also cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
