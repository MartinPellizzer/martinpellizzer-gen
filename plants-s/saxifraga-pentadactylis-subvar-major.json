    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis subvar. major, commonly known as the large-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly habitats, often in open, sunny environments. The plant features broad, succulent leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. This subvariety is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to other saxifrage species, contributing to its hardiness in harsh climates."
