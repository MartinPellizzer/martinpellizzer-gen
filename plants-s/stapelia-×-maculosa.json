    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 maculosa, commonly known as the spotted stapelia, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, waxy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or orange markings, resembling the appearance of a corpse. These flowers open in the early morning and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia \u00d7 maculosa is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
