    "intro": "Stellaria umbrosa, commonly known as shadowstar, is a low-growing perennial herb native to shaded forest floors in temperate regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Stellaria umbrosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland gardens."
