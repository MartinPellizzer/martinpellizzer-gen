    "intro": "Salix minutiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flower willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. The plant features slender, multi-stemmed branches with small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that gives it a distinctive appearance. Salix minutiflora plays an important role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife."
