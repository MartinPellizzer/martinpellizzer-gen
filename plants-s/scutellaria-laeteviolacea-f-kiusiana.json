    "intro": "Scutellaria laeteviolacea f. kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian blue skullcap, is a rare and striking member of the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
