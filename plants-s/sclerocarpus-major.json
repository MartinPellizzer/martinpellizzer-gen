    "intro": "Sclerocarpus major, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny, spherical fruits. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with a strong, unpleasant odor. Sclerocarpus major is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
