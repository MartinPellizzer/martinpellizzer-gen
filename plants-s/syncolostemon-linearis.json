    "intro": "Syncolostemon linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf synnema, is a perennial herb native to tropical Africa. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a faint fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or forest understories. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to humid, low-light conditions typical of its natural habitat."
