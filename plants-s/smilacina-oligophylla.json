    "intro": "Smilacina oligophylla, commonly known as red-berried smilacina, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that persist through the winter. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense thickets in shaded, moist environments. Smilacina oligophylla is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
