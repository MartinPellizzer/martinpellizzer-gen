    "intro": "Stigmatodon andaraiensis, commonly known as the Andaraiensis stigmate, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Its unique floral structure includes specialized stigmas that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat destruction, it is currently listed as endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
