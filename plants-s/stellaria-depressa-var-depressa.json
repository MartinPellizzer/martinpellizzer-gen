    "intro": "Stellaria depressa var. depressa, commonly known as the prostrate starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has thin, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream sides."
