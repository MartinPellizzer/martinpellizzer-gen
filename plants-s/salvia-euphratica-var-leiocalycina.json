    "intro": "Salvia euphratica var. leiocalycina, commonly known as the Desert Sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and striking purple to blue flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important species in its ecosystem. The plant's resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
