    "intro": "Stylocoryna buruensis, commonly known as the Buru ironwood, is a rare and woody plant native to the islands of Buru and Seram in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Stylocoryna buruensis is known for its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
