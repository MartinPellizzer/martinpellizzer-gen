    "intro": "Scleria aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange-eyed bulbous grass, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bulbous base and tall, grass-like stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Scleria aurantiaca is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient addition to xeriscapes and rock gardens."
