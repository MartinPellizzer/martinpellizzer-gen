    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. lanciacuminatum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a botanical variant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. Its fruit, a small, fleshy berry, is edible but contains toxic alkaloids, making it important to handle with care. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
