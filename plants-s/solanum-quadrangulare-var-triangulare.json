    "intro": "Solanum quadrangulare var. triangulare, commonly known as the three-angled nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its distinctive three-angled stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for ornamental or agricultural use."
