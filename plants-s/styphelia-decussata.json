    "intro": "Styphelia decussata, commonly known as the cross-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. Styphelia decussata is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
