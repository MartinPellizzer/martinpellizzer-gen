It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming in the morning. Sida massaica thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
