    "intro": "Scyphostelma intricatum, commonly known as the intricate scyphostelma, is a rare and delicate member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
