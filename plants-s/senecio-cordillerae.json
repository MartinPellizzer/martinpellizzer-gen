    "intro": "Senecio cordillerae, commonly known as the Cordillera Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Senecio cordillerae is relatively rare and often found in alpine regions."
