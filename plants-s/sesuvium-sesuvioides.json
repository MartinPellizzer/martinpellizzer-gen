    "intro": "Sesuvium sesuvioides, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by insects. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and arid environments. Sesuvium sesuvioides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
