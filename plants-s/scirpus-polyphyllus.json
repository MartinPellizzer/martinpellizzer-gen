    "intro": "Scirpus polyphyllus, commonly known as the many-leaved bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like flowers. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife."
