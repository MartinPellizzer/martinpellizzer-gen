    "intro": "Scirpus aristatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a tall, grass-like perennial plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually dark green and have a slight sheen. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Scirpus aristatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
