It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The leaves are broad and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
