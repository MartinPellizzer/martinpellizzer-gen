    "intro": "Sabia gaultheriifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a waxy, glandular coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
