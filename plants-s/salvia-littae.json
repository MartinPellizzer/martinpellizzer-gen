    "intro": "Salvia littae, commonly known as the coastal sage sagebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife. However, it is considered threatened due to habitat loss and urban development."
