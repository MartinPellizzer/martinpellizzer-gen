    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 nobrei nothosubsp. nobrei, commonly known as the noble willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a bright green. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its graceful appearance."
