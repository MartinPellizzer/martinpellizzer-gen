    "intro": "Sapindus travancorensis, commonly known as the Travancore soapnut, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn brown when mature. The fruit's outer husk contains a rich source of saponins, which are used in traditional soap-making and as a natural insecticide. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential in sustainable agriculture."
