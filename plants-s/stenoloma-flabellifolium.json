    "intro": "Stenoloma flabellifolium, commonly known as the flabellifolium fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive fan-like appearance that gives the plant its common name."
