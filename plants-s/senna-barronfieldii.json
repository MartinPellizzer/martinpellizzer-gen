    "intro": "Senna barronfieldii, commonly known as Barronfield senna, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and the plant is often grown for ornamental purposes. Senna barronfieldii is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
