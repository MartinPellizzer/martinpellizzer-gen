    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. nelsoniana, commonly known as the Nelson's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a short inflorescence. It is well adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy species. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
