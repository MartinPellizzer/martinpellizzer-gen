    "intro": "Solanum bifurcatum, commonly known as the two-branched nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from green to red. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of solanine and other alkaloids. Solanum bifurcatum is often found in dry, open habitats and is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae."
