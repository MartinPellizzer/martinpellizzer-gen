It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in riparian zones. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
