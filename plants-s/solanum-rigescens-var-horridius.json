    "intro": "Solanum rigescens var. horridius, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by berries that range in color from green to red. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
