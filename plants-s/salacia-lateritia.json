    "intro": "Salacia lateritia, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Salacia lateritia is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong sunlight."
