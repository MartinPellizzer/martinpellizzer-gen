    "intro": "Saxifraga dentata, commonly known as the toothed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, toothed leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Saxifraga dentata is a hardy species that is adapted to cold climates and can survive in regions with short growing seasons."
