    "intro": "Salicornia tenuis, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and estuaries. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt tolerance allows it to colonize areas where other plants cannot survive. Salicornia tenuis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
