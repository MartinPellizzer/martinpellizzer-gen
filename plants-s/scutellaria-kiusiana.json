    "intro": "Scutellaria kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late summer. Scutellaria kiusiana is often found in rocky or woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
