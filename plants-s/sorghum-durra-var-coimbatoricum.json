    "intro": "Sorghum durra var. coimbatoricum, commonly known as Coimbatoric sorghum, is a lesser-known variant of the sorghum genus native to specific regions of South Asia. It is characterized by its robust stalks and small, clustered inflorescences, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its seeds are used for both human consumption and animal feed, though it is less commonly cultivated than other sorghum varieties. Botanically, it is valued for its resilience to drought and its potential role in sustainable agriculture."
