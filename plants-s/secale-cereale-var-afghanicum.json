    "intro": "Secale cereale var. afghanicum, commonly known as Afghan rye, is a variant of rye that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. Its seeds are typically smaller and more elongated compared to standard rye, and it has a robust root system adapted to arid conditions. This variety is of interest for its potential in sustainable agriculture and for its unique genetic traits."
