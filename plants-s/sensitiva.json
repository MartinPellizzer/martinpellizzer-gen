    "intro": "Sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features palmate leaves with a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Sensitiva is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and reactive foliage."
