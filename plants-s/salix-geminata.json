    "intro": "Salix geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and alternate, oval to elliptic leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence, especially on the underside, which distinguishes it from other willow species. Salix geminata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats."
