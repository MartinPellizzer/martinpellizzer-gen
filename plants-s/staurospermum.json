These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that resemble a cross, hence their common name. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, while the fruits are small, dry capsules. Staurospermum species are often used in traditional medicine and have ornamental value due to their attractive blooms."
