    "intro": "Schmidelia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy schmidelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Schmidelia hirtella is an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
