    "intro": "Sclerolaena bicornis var. horrida, commonly known as the roughleaf sclerolaena, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months. Its stems are typically woody and can branch out extensively, forming dense shrubs. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
