    "intro": "Sacoila cerradicola, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, Sacoila cerradicola is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
