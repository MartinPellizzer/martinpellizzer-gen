    "intro": "Scaphosepalum rapax, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its smooth, green stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its berries, which are toxic, are orange-red and attract birds that help in seed dispersal. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural areas."
