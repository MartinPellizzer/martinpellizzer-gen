It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface. Stillingia coriacea is often found in rocky or forested habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
