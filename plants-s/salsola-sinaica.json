    "intro": "Salsola sinaica, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or perennial shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its succulent stems and leaves store moisture, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Salsola sinaica plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
