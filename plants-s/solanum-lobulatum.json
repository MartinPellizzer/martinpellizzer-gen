    "intro": "Solanum lobulatum, commonly known as the wooly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. Solanum lobulatum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
