    "intro": "Spiraea cana, commonly known as white meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, arching stems covered in small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its foliage turns a striking golden yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. Spiraea cana prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
