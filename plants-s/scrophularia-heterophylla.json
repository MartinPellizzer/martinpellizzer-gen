    "intro": "Scrophularia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb with a taproot system and hairy stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are variable in shape, which gives the species its common name, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Scrophularia heterophylla is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
