    "intro": "Seychellaria, commonly known as the Seychelles lily, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native habitat. Seychellaria has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant blooms during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
