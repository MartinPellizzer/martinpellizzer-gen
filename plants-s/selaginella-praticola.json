    "intro": "Selaginella praticola, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Selaginella praticola is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. It is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
