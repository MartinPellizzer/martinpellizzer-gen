    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. lilacinoflorum, commonly known as the lilacflowered Andean tomato, is a botanical variant of the Andean tomato species. It is characterized by its distinctive lilac-colored flowers, which contrast with the typical red or yellow blooms of its parent species. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. It produces small, edible fruits similar to those of other Solanum species, though they are often less commonly cultivated. Its ornamental value, combined with its potential for culinary use, makes it a unique and interesting plant in botanical gardens and experimental agriculture."
