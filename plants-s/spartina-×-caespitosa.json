    "intro": "Spartina \u00d7 caespitosa, commonly known as cordgrass, is a hybrid species native to the coastal regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that forms dense, tussock-like clumps, which help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Spartina \u00d7 caespitosa thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, making it an important component of tidal wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have also led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions."
