    "intro": "Schizaea cristata, commonly known as the crown fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright growth habit and the presence of a crown-like structure formed by the fusion of the stipe and rachis. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Schizaea cristata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a notable species within the Schizaeaceae family."
