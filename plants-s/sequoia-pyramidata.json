    "intro": "Sequoia pyramidata, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its massive size, with some specimens reaching heights of over 300 feet and diameters exceeding 20 feet. The tree has a distinctive pyramid-shaped crown and thick, furrowed bark that provides resistance to fire and pests. Its cones are small and woody, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The giant sequoia is also notable for its longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years."
