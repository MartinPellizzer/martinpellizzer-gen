    "intro": "Solanum pampaninii, commonly known as the Pampas nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, where it grows in dry, grassy habitats. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe, contain toxic alkaloids and are not suitable for human consumption. Solanum pampaninii is often found in open fields and along the edges of forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
