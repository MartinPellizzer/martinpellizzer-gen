It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Sloanea archboldiana is adapted to dry, rocky environments and exhibits a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
