    "intro": "Sida rodrigoi, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, blooming in the morning. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Sida rodrigoi is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
