    "intro": "Samara polygama, commonly known as the common sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bark that peels in papery layers. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. The plant is often found along riverbanks and in moist, well-drained soils."
