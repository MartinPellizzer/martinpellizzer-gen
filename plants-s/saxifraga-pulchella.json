    "intro": "Saxifraga pulchella, commonly known as the pretty saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of up to 10 centimeters, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve moisture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
