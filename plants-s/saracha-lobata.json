    "intro": "Saracha lobata, commonly known as the hairy leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its lobed thallus, which is covered in fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capability. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Saracha lobata plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
