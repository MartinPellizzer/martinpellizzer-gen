    "intro": "Stahlianthus andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's stahlianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species for studying island biodiversity."
