    "intro": "Stichorkis flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate stichorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy inflorescences that resemble small fans or fans of leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on nutrient-rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale in color, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stichorkis flabellata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
