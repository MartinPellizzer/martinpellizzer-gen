    "intro": "Spiranthes chloraeiformis, commonly known as the green spire orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
