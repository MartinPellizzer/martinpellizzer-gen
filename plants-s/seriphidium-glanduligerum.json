    "intro": "Seriphidium glanduligerum, commonly known as the sticky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is often found in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. Seriphidium glanduligerum is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
