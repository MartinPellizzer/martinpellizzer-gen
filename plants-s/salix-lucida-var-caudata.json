    "intro": "Salix lucida var. caudata, commonly known as the silky willow or woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense, silky-white catkins that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, elliptic to ovate, and have a soft, downy texture on both sides. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water bodies. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
