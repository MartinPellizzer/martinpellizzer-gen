    "intro": "Saxifraga hirta, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are hairy and often have a rosette shape, which helps to retain moisture in harsh environments. Saxifraga hirta is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
