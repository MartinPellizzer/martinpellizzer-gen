    "intro": "Scleria myricocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Scleria myricocarpa is typically found in moist habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along riverbanks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
