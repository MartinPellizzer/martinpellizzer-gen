    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara f. lucidum, commonly known as the smooth nightshade, is a variant of the common bindweed, characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and stems. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It is often found growing along fences, walls, and in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
