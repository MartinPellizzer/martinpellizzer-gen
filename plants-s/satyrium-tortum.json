    "intro": "Satyrium tortum, commonly known as the tortuous satyrium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it attaches itself to tree bark or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, aiding in light absorption. The orchid's unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
