    "intro": "Sapium reticulatum, commonly known as the Chinese red mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are a key feature of its fruiting stage. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
