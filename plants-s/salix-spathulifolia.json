    "intro": "Salix spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, often broad leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
