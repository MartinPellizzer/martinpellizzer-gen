It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Styphelia fraseri thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. It is an important component of the local flora, providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
