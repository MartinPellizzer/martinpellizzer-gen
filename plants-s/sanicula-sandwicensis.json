    "intro": "Sanicula sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sanicle, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and streamside areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of Hawaii's native flora."
