    "intro": "Syzygium jiewhoei, commonly known as the Jiewhoe's tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Vietnam and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns from green to yellow when ripe, and it is often used in local cuisines for its tangy flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syzygium jiewhoei is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
