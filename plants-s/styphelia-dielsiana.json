    "intro": "Styphelia dielsiana, commonly known as the Diels's winterbloom, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as sand dunes and coastal bluffs. It produces white or pinkish flowers in late winter to early spring, making it a notable early bloomer in its native range. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a sought-after plant for specialty gardens."
