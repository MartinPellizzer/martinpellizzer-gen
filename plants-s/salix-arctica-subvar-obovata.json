It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to grow on rocky or barren ground. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra ecosystems."
