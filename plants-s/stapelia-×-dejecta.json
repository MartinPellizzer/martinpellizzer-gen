    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 dejecta, commonly known as the \"Corpse Flower\" or \"Stapeliinae,\" is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and distinctive, showy flowers. The plant produces large, waxy, yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which mimics decaying flesh to attract pollinators. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. Stapelia \u00d7 dejecta thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
