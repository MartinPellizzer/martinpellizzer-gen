    "intro": "Selaginella sibogana, commonly known as the \"spike moss,\" is a species of spiky, low-growing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that form tight, compact clusters. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Selaginella sibogana is a vascular plant with a complex root system and is capable of reproducing via spores, which are released from specialized structures called strobila. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
