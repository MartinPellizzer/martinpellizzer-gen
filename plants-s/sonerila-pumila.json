It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by red, fleshy berries. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a garden plant in tropical and subtropical climates."
