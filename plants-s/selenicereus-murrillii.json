    "intro": "Selenicereus murrillii, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
