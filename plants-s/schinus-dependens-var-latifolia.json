    "intro": "Schinus dependens var. latifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or \"pau-ferro,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a reddish or bronze hue when young. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
