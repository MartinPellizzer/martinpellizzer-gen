    "intro": "Stipa orientalis var. trichoglossa, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, cylindrical inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. Its foliage is characterized by a soft, silvery-blue color due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is well-suited for dry, well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping."
