    "intro": "Selago lucida, commonly known as the shining sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Selago lucida is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions."
