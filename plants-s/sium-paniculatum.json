    "intro": "Sium paniculatum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in an umbrella-like cluster called an umbel. Its roots are similar to those of parsley and parsnip, though they are less commonly used in cooking. Sium paniculatum thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
