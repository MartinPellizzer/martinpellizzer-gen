    "intro": "Syringa caerulea, commonly known as the common lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of purple, white, or pink. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it can grow up to 6 to 12 feet tall. Syringa caerulea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and landscapes for its showy spring display."
