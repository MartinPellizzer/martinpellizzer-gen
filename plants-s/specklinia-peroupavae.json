    "intro": "Specklinia peroupavae, commonly known as the Peroupa's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Specklinia peroupavae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
