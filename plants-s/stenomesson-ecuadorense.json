It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
