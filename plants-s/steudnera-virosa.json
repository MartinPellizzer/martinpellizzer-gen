    "intro": "Steudnera virosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. Steudnera virosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dramatic foliage. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be ingested."
