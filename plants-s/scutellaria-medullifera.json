    "intro": "Scutellaria medullifera, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Scutellaria medullifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
