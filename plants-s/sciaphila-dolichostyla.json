    "intro": "Sciaphila dolichostyla, commonly known as the long-styled forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in the understory of dense forests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
