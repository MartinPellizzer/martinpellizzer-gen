    "intro": "Schefflera nono, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella tree, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded canopy with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Schefflera nono is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
