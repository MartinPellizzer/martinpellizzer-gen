    "intro": "Salix myrtillifolia var. pseudomyrsinites, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, elliptical, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This variant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in tundra ecosystems."
