    "intro": "Shorea crassa, commonly known as the Malacca ebony, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its density and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a warm, humid climate with ample rainfall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
