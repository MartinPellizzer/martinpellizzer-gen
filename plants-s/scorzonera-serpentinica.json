It is characterized by its deep taproot and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in poor, rocky soils, particularly those rich in magnesium and low in nutrients. Scorzonera serpentinica is often found in limestone and serpentine habitats, showcasing its ability to tolerate heavy metals in the soil."
