    "intro": "Scaphyglottis bicallosa, commonly known as the hairy-tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy sepals and petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Scaphyglottis bicallosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
