    "intro": "Salix eriophylla, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. Salix eriophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
