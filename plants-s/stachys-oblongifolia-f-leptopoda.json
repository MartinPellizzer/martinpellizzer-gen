It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and antispasmodic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions."
