    "intro": "Spiradiclis liboensis, commonly known as the Lobo spiradiclis, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Spiradiclis liboensis is considered a vulnerable species."
