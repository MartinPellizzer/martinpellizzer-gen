    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum, commonly known as the potato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, producing underground tubers that serve as its primary storage organs. The plant typically has alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a hairy surface, and its flowers are usually white or purple, clustered in terminal umbels. The tubers, which are the economically important part of the plant, are rich in starch and are widely cultivated as a staple food crop worldwide."
