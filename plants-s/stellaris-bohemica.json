    "intro": "Stellaris bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped blossoms that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellaris bohemica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
