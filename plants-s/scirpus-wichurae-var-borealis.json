    "intro": "Scirpus wichurae var. borealis, commonly known as the northern bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to northern regions of North America. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems with fibrous, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life. The species is well adapted to cold climates and is an important component of northern wetland ecosystems."
