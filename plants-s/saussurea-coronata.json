    "intro": "Saussurea coronata, commonly known as the \"Edible Aster\" or \"Garden Aster,\" is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia, Mongolia, and China. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring a thick, branched root system and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence. It is valued for its medicinal properties, with the roots used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
