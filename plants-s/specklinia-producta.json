    "intro": "Specklinia producta, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cascading fronds that often hang from trees in its natural habitat. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with slender, wiry stems that support its foliage. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a light green color with a subtle sheen. Specklinia producta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
