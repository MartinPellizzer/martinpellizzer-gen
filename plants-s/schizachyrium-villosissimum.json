    "intro": "Schizachyrium villosissimum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its silvery-gray appearance due to the fine, hairy texture of its leaves. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Schizachyrium villosissimum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
