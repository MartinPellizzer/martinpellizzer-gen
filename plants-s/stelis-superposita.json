    "intro": "Stelis superposita, commonly known as the layered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Stelis superposita is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
