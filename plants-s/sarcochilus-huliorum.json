    "intro": "Sarcochilus huliorum, commonly known as the Hulio\u2019s sarcochilus, is a rare and unusual orchid native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy pseudobulbs, which help it store water in its native arid environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
