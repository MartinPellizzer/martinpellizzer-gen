    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 abingdonensis, commonly known as the Abingdon saxifrage, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Saxifraga cotyledon and Saxifraga oppositifolia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, pink or white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a panicle-like structure. Due to its ornamental value and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
