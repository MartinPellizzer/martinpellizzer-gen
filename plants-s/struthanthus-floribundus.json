    "intro": "Struthanthus floribundus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Struthanthus floribundus is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
