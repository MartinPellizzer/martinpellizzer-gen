    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata f. humilis, commonly known as the low saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense, mat-like rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, granular texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. Saxifraga granulata f. humilis is well adapted to harsh conditions, showcasing its resilience in cold and arid climates."
