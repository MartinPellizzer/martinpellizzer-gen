    "intro": "Sicyos microcarpus var. kalaupapaensis, commonly known as the Kalaupapa bottle gourd, is a rare variant of the bottle gourd native to the island of Molokai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically green when mature. The plant thrives in tropical climates and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, with a hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
