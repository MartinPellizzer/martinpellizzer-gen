    "intro": "Saussurea vittifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features a tall, branched stem with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are yellow and resemble those of the safflower, hence its common name. Saussurea vittifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
