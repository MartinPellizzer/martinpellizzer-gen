    "intro": "Statice collina, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime environments. The plant produces spikes of blue, purple, or pink flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are grey-green and help reduce water loss in its saline habitat. Statice collina is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
