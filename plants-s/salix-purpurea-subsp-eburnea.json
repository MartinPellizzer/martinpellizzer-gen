    "intro": "Salix purpurea subsp. eburnea, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its striking white to pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
