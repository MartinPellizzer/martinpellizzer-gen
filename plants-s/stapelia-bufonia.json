    "intro": "Stapelia bufonia, commonly known as the white-stalked stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a layer of white, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with red markings, resembling a corpse. It thrives in arid conditions and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
