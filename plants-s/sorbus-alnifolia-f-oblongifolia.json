    "intro": "Sorbus alnifolia f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptic to oblong leaves that are often densely hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This form is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Sorbus alnifolia."
