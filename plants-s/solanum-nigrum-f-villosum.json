    "intro": "Solanum nigrum f. villosum, commonly known as the hairy black nightshade, is a variant of the black nightshade plant. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form. This plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open areas. The small, black berries are edible when ripe but contain solanine, making them toxic in large quantities. It is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it can spread aggressively."
