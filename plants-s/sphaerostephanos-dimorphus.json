    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos dimorphus, commonly known as the two-form starflower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple, adding a dramatic visual element to its habitat. The plant has two distinct morphological forms, which are believed to be adaptations to different environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while its stems are erect and can grow up to several feet in height. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sphaerostephanos dimorphus is considered a conservation concern."
