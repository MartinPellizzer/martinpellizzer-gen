It belongs to the family Littorinidae and is characterized by its small, conical shell. The shell is typically yellowish or brownish in color, with a rough, granular surface. This species is often found in rocky intertidal zones, where it attaches to substrates using its muscular foot. Its diet primarily consists of algae, which it scrapes from the surfaces it inhabits."
