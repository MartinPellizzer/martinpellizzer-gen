    "intro": "Salix heterochroma var. heterochroma, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which often exhibits a mix of green, white, and brown tones, creating a striking visual contrast. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges."
