    "intro": "Stictocardia tiliifolia subsp. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a distinct, leathery texture. The species is typically found on tree bark and rocks in forested areas, particularly in the Society Islands. Its morphology includes a well-developed medulla and a cortex that is often differentiated. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
