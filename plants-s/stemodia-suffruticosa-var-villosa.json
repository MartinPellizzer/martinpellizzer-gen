It has a woody stem covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its varietal name \"villosa.\" The plant typically features small, opposite leaves that are often hairy on both surfaces. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. This plant is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
