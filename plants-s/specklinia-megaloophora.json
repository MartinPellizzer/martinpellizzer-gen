    "intro": "Specklinia megaloophora, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
