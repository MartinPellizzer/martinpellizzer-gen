    "intro": "Sambucus japonica, commonly known as Japanese elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features compound leaves with 5\u20137 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain seeds that are toxic if ingested raw. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
