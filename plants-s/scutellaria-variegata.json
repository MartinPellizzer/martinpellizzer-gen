    "intro": "Scutellaria variegata, commonly known as the variegated skullcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white. The plant produces spikes of small, blue to violet flowers in the summer months, which are clustered in whorls along the stem. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties. Scutellaria variegata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
