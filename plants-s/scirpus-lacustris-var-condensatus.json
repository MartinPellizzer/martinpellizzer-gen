    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense club rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of stems that grow from rhizomes, forming compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically greenish or brown in color. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with a fine layer of wax. This variety is adapted to saturated soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
