    "intro": "Skeptrostachys rupestris, commonly known as the rock wallaby bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
