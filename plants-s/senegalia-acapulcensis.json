    "intro": "Senegalia acapulcensis, commonly known as the Acapulco burrobrush, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silvery-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its woody structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments. Senegalia acapulcensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
