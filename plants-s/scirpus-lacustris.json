    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris, commonly known as the marsh reed, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems. The plant has long, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus lacustris plays an important role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
