    "intro": "Stelis norae, commonly known as the Norae's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with a unique coloration, often featuring a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis norae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
