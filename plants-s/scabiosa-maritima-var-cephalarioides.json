    "intro": "Scabiosa maritima var. cephalarioides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by silky, white bracts that give it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
