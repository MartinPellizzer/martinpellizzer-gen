    "intro": "Schmaltzia anomala, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and turn yellow in the fall. Schmaltzia anomala thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
