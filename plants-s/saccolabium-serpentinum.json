    "intro": "Saccolabium serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found on rocky outcrops and serpentine soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. Saccolabium serpentinum is typically found in open habitats and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
