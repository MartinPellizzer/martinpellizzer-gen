    "intro": "Sterculia surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam sterculia, is a tropical tree belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
