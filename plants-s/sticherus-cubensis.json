    "intro": "Sticherus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban sticherus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive fruiting structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Sticherus cubensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
