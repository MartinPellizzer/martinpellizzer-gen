    "intro": "Sempervivum ornatum, commonly known as the \"Hens and Chicks,\" is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette-shaped stem with fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sempervivum ornatum is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which can be separated and planted to grow new plants."
