    "intro": "Stellaria tomentosa, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Stellaria tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and blooms."
