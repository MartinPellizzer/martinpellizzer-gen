    "intro": "Spiranthes colorata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by the presence of purple or reddish spots on its flowers, which are more prominent in certain light conditions."
