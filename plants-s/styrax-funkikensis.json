    "intro": "Styrax funkikensis, commonly known as the Funk's styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Styrax funkikensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
