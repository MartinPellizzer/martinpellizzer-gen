    "intro": "Salix camusi, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
