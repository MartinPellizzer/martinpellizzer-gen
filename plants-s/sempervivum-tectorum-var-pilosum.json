    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. pilosum, commonly known as the fuzzy houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically green with a bluish or silver hue, and they are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, pink or red flowers in the summer, which are borne on tall stems. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
