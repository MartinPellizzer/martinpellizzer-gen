    "intro": "Staurogeton tener, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Staurogeton tener is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its low-growing habit and salt tolerance make it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions."
