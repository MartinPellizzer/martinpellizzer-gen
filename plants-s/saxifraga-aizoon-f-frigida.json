It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
