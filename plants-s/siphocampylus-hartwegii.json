    "intro": "Siphocampylus hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its restricted habitat, Siphocampylus hartwegii is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
