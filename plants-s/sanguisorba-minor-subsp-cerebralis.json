It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other wet habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wetland conservation efforts."
