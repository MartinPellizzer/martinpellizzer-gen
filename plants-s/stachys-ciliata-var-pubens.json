    "intro": "Stachys ciliata var. pubens, commonly known as hairy betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped with ciliate margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
