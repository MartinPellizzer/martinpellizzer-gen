    "intro": "Salix composita, commonly known as the composite willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its roots are known for their extensive network, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Salix composita is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of lightweight timber."
