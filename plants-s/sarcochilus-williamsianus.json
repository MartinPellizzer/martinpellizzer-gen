    "intro": "Sarcochilus williamsianus, commonly known as the Williams' sarcochilus, is a rare and unique orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting orange-red flowers that bloom on erect, leafless stems. The plant has a distinctive sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This orchid is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments."
