    "intro": "Sclerostylis ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved rock fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Sclerostylis ovalifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
