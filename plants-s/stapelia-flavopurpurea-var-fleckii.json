    "intro": "Stapelia flavopurpurea var. fleckii, commonly known as the Fleck's Sunset Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with reddish or purple markings, resembling a sunset. These flowers bloom in the evening and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
