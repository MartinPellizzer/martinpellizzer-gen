    "intro": "Salix purpureoformis, commonly known as the purpleform willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of small, reddish-purple catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing early-season food for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
