    "intro": "Salix rupifraga, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on steep slopes. The plant has slender, often twisted branches and produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Salix rupifraga plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
