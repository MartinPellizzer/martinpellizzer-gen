    "intro": "Saxifraga tricrenata, commonly known as the three-lobed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features rosettes of basal leaves with serrated edges and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically three-lobed, giving it its common name, and it is known for its resilience in harsh, cold environments. Saxifraga tricrenata is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
