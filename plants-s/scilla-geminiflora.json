    "intro": "Scilla geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered scilla, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western Mediterranean region, including parts of Spain and southern France. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. Its bulbs are perennial, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils. Scilla geminiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
