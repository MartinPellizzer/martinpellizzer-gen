    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salvia officinalus subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as wooly mint or tomentose sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to its more common relative, Salvia officinalis."
