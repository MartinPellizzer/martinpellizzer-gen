    "intro": "Stizophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color. Stizophyllum species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
