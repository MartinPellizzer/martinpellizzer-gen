    "intro": "Spartina anglica, commonly known as cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coasts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand saltwater and tidal conditions. This species forms dense mats in intertidal zones, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal sediments and preventing erosion. Spartina anglica is also known for its ability to hybridize with native grasses, sometimes leading to ecological concerns. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated."
