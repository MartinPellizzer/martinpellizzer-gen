    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 exsul, commonly known as the stonecrop hybrid, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and drought tolerance. Sempervivum \u00d7 exsul is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it easy to cultivate and spread."
