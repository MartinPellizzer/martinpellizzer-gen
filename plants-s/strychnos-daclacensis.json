    "intro": "Strychnos daclacensis, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain small, black seeds. It is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
