    "intro": "Sempervivum bollei, commonly known as the Bolle's houseleek, is a species of succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features rosettes of fleshy, upright leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Sempervivum bollei is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which helps it spread in natural habitats."
