It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, follicle-like fruits that are covered in fine, hairy structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
