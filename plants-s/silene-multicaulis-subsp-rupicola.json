    "intro": "Silene multicaulis subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock bladder campion, is a perennial herb native to rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in summer, typically arranged in a single, terminal cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
