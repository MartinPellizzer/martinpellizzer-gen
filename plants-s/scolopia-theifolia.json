    "intro": "Scolopia theifolia, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. The plant produces trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems spread along the ground, forming a dense mat. Scolopia theifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
