    "intro": "Spergula linicola, commonly known as the linseed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. Spergula linicola is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
