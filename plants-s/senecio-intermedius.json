It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Senecio intermedius is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
