    "intro": "Salvia lupulina, commonly known as purple sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapes. Salvia lupulina is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
