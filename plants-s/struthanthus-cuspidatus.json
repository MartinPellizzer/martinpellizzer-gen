    "intro": "Struthanthus cuspidatus, commonly known as the sharp-pointed struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Loasaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Struthanthus cuspidatus is known for its short blooming period, usually occurring in late spring to early summer."
