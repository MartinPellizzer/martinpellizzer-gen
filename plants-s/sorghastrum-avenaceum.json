    "intro": "Sorghastrum avenaceum, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species."
