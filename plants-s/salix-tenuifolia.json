    "intro": "Salix tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, often alpine or tundra environments. It has a shallow root system and is well adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Salix tenuifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
