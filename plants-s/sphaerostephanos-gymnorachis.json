    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos gymnorachis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. Sphaerostephanos gymnorachis is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays a role in the regeneration of heathlands."
