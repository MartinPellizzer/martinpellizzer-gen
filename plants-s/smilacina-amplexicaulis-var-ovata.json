It features heart-shaped, ovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
