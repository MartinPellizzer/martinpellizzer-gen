    "intro": "Salicornia annua, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is widely distributed along coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Salicornia annua is also used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its high mineral content and unique flavor."
