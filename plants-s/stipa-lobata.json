    "intro": "Stipa lobata, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, pale florets that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Stipa lobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
