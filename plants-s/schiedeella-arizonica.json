    "intro": "Schiedeella arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona schiedea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
