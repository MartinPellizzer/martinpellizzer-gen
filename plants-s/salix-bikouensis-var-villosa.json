It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, hairy on both surfaces, and have a soft, velvety texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions."
