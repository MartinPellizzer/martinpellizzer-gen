    "intro": "Solanum villaricense var. typicum, commonly known as the Villarica nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils. Its fruits are small, berry-like, and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
