    "intro": "Statice androsacea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salt levels makes it a hardy, drought-resistant species. Statice androsacea is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
