    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 dichroa var. obovata, commonly known as the white willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a broad base and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the autumn. It produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This species is also valued for its medicinal properties, as its bark contains salicin, a compound similar to aspirin."
