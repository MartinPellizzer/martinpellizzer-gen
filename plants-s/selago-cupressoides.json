    "intro": "Selago cupressoides, commonly known as the coastal cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the surrounding environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind, making it well-suited for coastal habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping in arid and coastal areas."
