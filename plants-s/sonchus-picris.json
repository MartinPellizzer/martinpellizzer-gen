    "intro": "Sonchus picris, commonly known as prickly sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Native to Europe, it is now found in various parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
