    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable-leaved star-flower, is a member of the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant exhibits variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either opposite or whorled depending on the growth conditions. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and adaptation."
