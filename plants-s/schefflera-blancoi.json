    "intro": "Schefflera blancoi, commonly known as the Blanco's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves that give it a lush, umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera blancoi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
