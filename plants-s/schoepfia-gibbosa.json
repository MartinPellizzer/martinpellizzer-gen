    "intro": "Schoepfia gibbosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to drought conditions. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, also serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
