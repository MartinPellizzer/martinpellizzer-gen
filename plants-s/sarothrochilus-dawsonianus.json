    "intro": "Sarothrochilus dawsonianus, commonly known as the Dawson's rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its small size and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sarothrochilus dawsonianus is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
