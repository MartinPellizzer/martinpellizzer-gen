    "intro": "Stipa arenosa, commonly known as the sand grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppes, deserts, and coastal dunes. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Stipa arenosa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
