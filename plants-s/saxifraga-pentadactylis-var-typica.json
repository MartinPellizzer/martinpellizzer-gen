    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis var. typica, commonly known as the five-finger saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed, resembling fingers, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga pentadactylis var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
