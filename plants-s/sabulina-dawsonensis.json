    "intro": "Sabulina dawsonensis, commonly known as Dawson's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy habitats of western North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant typically grows in open areas such as gravelly slopes and dry meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its morphology reflects its adaptation to harsh environments, with features that minimize water loss and maximize sunlight absorption. Sabulina dawsonensis is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, contributing to the biodiversity of these unique ecosystems."
