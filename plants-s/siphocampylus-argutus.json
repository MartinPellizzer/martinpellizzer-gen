It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its mucilaginous properties in its seeds. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
