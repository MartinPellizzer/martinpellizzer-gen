    "intro": "Solanum cestrophyllum, commonly known as the purple eggplant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, purple fruit that resembles an egg. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals, and it produces small, round berries that turn from green to purple as they mature. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other solanaceous crops."
