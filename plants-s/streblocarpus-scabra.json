    "intro": "Streblocarpus scabra, commonly known as the rough-stemmed arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its stout, ridged stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white spadices that are typical of the genus. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy food source, similar to traditional arrowroot. Streblocarpus scabra thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
