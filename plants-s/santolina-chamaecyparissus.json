    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus, commonly known as Spanish santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, low-growing foliage composed of silver-gray, aromatic leaves that are narrow and needle-like. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are borne in dense, rounded clusters. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its silvery foliage and fragrant, medicinal properties."
