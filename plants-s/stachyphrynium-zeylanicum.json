    "intro": "Stachyphrynium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are surrounded by a spadix, typical of the arum family. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, which are starch-rich and used as a food source. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
