    "intro": "Solidago humilis f. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well-suited for high-altitude habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
