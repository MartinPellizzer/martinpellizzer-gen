    "intro": "Scytalia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered scytalia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, tubular flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind. Scytalia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
