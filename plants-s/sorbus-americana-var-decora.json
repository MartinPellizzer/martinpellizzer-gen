    "intro": "Sorbus americana var. decora, commonly known as the showy mountain-ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its attractive, bright red berries that persist through the winter, providing food for wildlife. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges, and in spring, it bears clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers, foliage, and berries, which contribute to its ecological and aesthetic significance."
