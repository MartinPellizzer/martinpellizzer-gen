    "intro": "Scorzonera tortuosissima, commonly known as the twisted scuron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or deeply divided. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, tubular shape, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fleshy and tuberous, which is a key feature for its survival in harsh, rocky environments. Scorzonera tortuosissima is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
