    "intro": "Stevia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are small, stiff, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Stevia pinifolia is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
