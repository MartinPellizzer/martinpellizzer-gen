It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
