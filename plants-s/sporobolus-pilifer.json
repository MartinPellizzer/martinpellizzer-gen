    "intro": "Sporobolus pilifer, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Sporobolus pilifer is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
