    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. rubellum, commonly known as crimson stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright red flowers. It is native to Europe and is well adapted to rocky and dry environments. The leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, star-shaped blooms in the summer. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is particularly noted for its vibrant color and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
