    "intro": "Soulamea fraxinifolia, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that resemble those of the ash tree, hence its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
