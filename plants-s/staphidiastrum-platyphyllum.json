    "intro": "Staphidiastrum platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaf staphidiastrum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
