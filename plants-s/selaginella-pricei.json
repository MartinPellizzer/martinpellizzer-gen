    "intro": "Selaginella pricei, commonly known as the Mexican spike moss, is a small, evergreen, spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of linear, glossy leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Selaginella pricei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
