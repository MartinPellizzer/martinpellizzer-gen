    "intro": "Sorbus flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a fan, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, apple-like berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or on rocky slopes. Sorbus flabellifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
