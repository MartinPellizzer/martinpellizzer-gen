    "intro": "Sida yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas sida, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, alternate leaves and small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shrublands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
