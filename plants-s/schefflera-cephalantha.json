    "intro": "Schefflera cephalantha, commonly known as the white schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera cephalantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
