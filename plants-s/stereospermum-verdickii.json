It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
