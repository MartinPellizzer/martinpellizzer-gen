    "intro": "Schedonorus spicatus, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Schedonorus spicatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
