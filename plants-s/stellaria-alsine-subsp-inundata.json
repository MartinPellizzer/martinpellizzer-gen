    "intro": "Stellaria alsine subsp. inundata, commonly known as water starwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
