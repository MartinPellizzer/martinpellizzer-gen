    "intro": "Soldanella alpina var. vulgaris, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This species is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
