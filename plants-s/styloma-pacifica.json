    "intro": "Styloma pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific styloma, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Styloma pacifica typically grows in moist, sandy soils along tidal zones and is often found in association with other coastal flora. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed coastal ecosystems."
