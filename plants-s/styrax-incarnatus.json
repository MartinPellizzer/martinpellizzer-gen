    "intro": "Styrax incarnatus, commonly known as the red styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, turning reddish in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Styrax incarnatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
