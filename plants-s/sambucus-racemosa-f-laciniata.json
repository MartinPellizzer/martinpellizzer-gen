    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. laciniata, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmately lobed and often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
