    "intro": "Solanum vincentii, commonly known as Vincent's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption or cultivation."
