    "intro": "Saxifraga rufescens var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically reddish in color, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in colder climates."
