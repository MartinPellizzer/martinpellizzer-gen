    "intro": "Shorea wangtianshuea var. kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi shorea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Vietnam, Laos, and China's Guangxi region. This tree is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 40 meters in height, and its buttressed roots, which aid in stabilizing it in moist, tropical soils. The bark is typically smooth and light grey, while the leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native forests, contributing to biodiversity and carbon sequestration."
