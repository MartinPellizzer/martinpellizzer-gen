    "intro": "Suchtelenia calycina, commonly known as the calycine lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, greenish-gray mats on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which includes a complex system of rhizines for anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant's reproductive structures, known as apothecia, are small and often embedded within the thallus, making them difficult to observe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Suchtelenia calycina is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
