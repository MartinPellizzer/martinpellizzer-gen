    "intro": "Scirpus globifer, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features a tall, cylindrical stem that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Scirpus globifer plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
