    "intro": "Salix diffusa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Salix diffusa is often found near water sources and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
