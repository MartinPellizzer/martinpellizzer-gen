    "intro": "Sticherus antillensis, commonly known as the Antillean sticherus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or along the edges of wetlands. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
