    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum epiphyticum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on atmospheric moisture for survival. The plant produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks or branches of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
