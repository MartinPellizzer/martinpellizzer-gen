    "intro": "Sansevieria pfisteri, commonly known as the Pfister's snake plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to tropical regions of Africa. It features tall, upright leaves that are typically dark green with prominent, wavy margins and a lighter green or white midrib. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers on slender, erect spikes, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are stiff and fibrous, with a unique, almost reptilian texture that gives it its common name. Sansevieria pfisteri is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in low-light conditions, making it an excellent choice for indoor gardening."
