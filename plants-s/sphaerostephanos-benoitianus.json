    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos benoitianus, commonly known as the Benoit's globe flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its unique, globe-shaped inflorescence composed of small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
