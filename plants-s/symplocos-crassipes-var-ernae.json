    "intro": "Symplocos crassipes var. ernae, commonly known as the roughleaf inkberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised dots, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for hedges and erosion control in wetland environments."
