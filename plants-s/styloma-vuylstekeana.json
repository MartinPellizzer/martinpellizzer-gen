    "intro": "Styloma vuylstekeana, commonly known as the Vuylsteker's styloma, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Styloma vuylstekeana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
