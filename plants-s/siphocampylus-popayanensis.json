    "intro": "Siphocampylus popayanensis, commonly known as the Popay\u00e1n bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
