    "intro": "Schismus calycinus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf bladdergrass, is a small, mat-forming annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of bladder-like structures on its stems, which are typical of the Schismus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its low water requirements, it is adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures."
