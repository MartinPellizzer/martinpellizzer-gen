It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Stenocarpus varians is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
