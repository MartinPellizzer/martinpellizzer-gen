    "intro": "Soldanella montana var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude conditions."
