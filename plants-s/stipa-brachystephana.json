    "intro": "Stipa brachystephana, commonly known as the shortstep grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Stipa brachystephana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
