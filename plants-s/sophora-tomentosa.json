    "intro": "Sophora tomentosa, commonly known as the Chinese\u69d0 or the hairy sophora, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are covered in a dense, woolly white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
