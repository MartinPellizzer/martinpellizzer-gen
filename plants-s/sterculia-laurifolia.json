    "intro": "Sterculia laurifolia, commonly known as the satinwood or broadleaf sterculia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
