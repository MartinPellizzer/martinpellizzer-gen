    "intro": "Sium ternifolium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and can be harvested for its aromatic, edible roots. Sium ternifolium thrives in wetlands, streams, and other aquatic environments, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
