    "intro": "Salix humboldtiana var. fruticosa, commonly known as the Humboldt's willow or the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It typically grows in riparian zones, along streams and rivers, and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, especially on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks."
