    "intro": "Sarracenia alata var. cuprea, commonly known as the red-winged pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form specialized pitchers designed to trap and digest insects. The plant's most distinctive feature is its vibrant red coloration, which is especially prominent in the midrib and along the edges of the leaves. The pitchers are typically green with red veins, and they produce nectar to attract prey. This variety is well adapted to wet, acidic soils and thrives in swampy or boggy habitats."
