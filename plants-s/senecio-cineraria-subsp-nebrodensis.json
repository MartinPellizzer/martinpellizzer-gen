    "intro": "Senecio cineraria subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebrodene skyflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, woolly leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
