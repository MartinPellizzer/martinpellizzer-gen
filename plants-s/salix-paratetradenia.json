    "intro": "Salix paratetradenia, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for ecological restoration projects."
