    "intro": "Stilpnopappus aquaticus, commonly known as the water ragwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in wet environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Stilpnopappus aquaticus is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
