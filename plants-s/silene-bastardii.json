It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene bastardii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a rare species in some areas."
