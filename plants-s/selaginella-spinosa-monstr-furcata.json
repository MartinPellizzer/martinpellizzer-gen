    "intro": "Selaginella spinosa monstr. furcata, commonly known as the forked spikemoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of spirally arranged, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like strobila that bear microspores and megaspores, facilitating its reproduction. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its distinctive forked structure and resilience make it a notable species in botanical studies."
