It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces striking, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in its native habitat. Sarcochilus berkleyi is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
