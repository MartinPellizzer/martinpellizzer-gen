    "intro": "Santiria montana, commonly known as mountain santiria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Santiria montana is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
