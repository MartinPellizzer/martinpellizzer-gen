    "intro": "Senecio multicaulis var. microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features compact rosettes of narrow, blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
