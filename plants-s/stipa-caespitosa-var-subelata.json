    "intro": "Stipa caespitosa var. subelata, commonly known as the silvergrass or tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, forming compact clumps. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue due to the fine, silky hairs covering the foliage. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of pale green to golden florets. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its elegant appearance and drought tolerance."
