    "intro": "Salvia isochroma, commonly known as blue sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Salvia isochroma thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique color and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
