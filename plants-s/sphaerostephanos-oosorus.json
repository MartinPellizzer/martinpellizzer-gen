    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos oosorus, commonly known as the golden cup moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like thallus that is often covered in a dense layer of small, yellowish structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized cups and aid in its propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
