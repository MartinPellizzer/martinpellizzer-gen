    "intro": "Saxifraga androsacea var. subacaulis, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates and poor soil conditions. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer, and are clustered in umbels. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to other varieties of Saxifraga androsacea."
