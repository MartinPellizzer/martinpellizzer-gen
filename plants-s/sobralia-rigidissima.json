    "intro": "Sobralia rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid sobralia, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, producing intricate, butterfly-like petals that attract pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the stem. Sobralia rigidissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
