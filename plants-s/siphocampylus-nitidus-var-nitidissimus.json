    "intro": "Siphocampylus nitidus var. nitidissimus, commonly known as the shining rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
