    "intro": "Schizoglossum baumii, commonly known as the Baumann's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a slender rhizome and a single, elongated leaf that supports its inflorescence. Schizoglossum baumii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
