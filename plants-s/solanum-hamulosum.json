    "intro": "Solanum hamulosum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, red berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially dangerous if consumed in large quantities. Solanum hamulosum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
