    "intro": "Sideroxylon cambodianum var. thorelii, commonly known as the Cambodian ironwood, is a rare and woody plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are usually alternate and oval-shaped, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
