    "intro": "Syzygium austrocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian apple or kaukau, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the island of New Caledonia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Syzygium austrocaledonicum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
