    "intro": "Stevia tenuifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf or honey plant, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as alternatives to sugar. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for both ornamental and commercial cultivation. Stevia tenuifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties and environmental resilience."
