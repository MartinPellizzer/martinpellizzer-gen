It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical *Sorbus aria*. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a range of wildlife."
