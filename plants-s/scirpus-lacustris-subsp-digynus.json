    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris subsp. digynus, commonly known as the water club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features tall, cylindrical stems that grow from rhizomes, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically found in two distinct clusters on the same stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its ability to thrive in water-saturated soils. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
