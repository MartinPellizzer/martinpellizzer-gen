    "intro": "Setaria welwitschii, commonly known as Welwitsch's foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive foxtail appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Setaria welwitschii is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
