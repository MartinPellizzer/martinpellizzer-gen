    "intro": "Smilax stans var. verruculosifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf smilax, is a variant of the smilax genus native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in small, warty bumps. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental features, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
