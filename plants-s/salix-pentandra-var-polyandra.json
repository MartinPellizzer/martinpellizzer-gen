    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. polyandra, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are often silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. The silver willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
