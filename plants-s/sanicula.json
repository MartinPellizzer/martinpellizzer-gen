    "intro": "Sanicula, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to greenish-yellow. Sanicula species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They produce small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse their seeds by wind. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
