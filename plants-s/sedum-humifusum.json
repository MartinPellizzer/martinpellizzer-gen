    "intro": "Sedum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Sedum humifusum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
