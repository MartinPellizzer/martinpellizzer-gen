    "intro": "Solanum stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
