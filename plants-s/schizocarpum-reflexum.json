    "intro": "Schizocarpum reflexum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, lobed fruits that split into segments when mature. Schizocarpum reflexum is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
