    "intro": "Slateria coerulea, commonly known as the blue slater, is a striking flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. Slateria coerulea thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
