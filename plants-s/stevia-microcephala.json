    "intro": "Stevia microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Due to its medicinal properties and low maintenance requirements, it is gaining popularity as a sustainable alternative to traditional sugar sources."
