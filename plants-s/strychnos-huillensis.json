It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. While it is not widely cultivated, it holds ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
