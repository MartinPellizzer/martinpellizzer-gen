    "intro": "Spiraea stipularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems that droop gracefully, often forming cascading clusters. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which appear before the leaves unfold. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. Spiraea stipularis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows."
