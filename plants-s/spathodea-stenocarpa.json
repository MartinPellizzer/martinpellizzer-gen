    "intro": "Spathodea stenocarpa, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Spathodea stenocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in full sun and well-drained soil."
