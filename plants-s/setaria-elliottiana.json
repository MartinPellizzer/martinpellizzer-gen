    "intro": "Setaria elliottiana, commonly known as Elliott's millet, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elliott's millet is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of these environments."
