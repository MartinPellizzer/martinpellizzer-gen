    "intro": "Sedum rupestre var. collinum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky habitats in Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and minimal care requirements make it a popular ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates."
