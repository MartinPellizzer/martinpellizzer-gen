    "intro": "Statice aciphylla, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice aciphylla is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in floral arrangements and as a cut flower."
