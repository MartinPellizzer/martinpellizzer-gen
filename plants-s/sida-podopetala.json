    "intro": "Sida podopetala, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or riparian habitats. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida podopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
