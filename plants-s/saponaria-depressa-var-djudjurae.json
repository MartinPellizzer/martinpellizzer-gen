    "intro": "Saponaria depressa var. djudjurae, commonly known as the dwarf soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has hairy, wrinkled leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and its sap contains saponins, which can produce a soapy lather when mixed with water. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
