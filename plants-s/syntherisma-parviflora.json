    "intro": "Syntherisma parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered syntherism, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Syntherisma parviflora is known for its short blooming season, usually in late spring, and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure."
