    "intro": "Stipa pinetorum, commonly known as the pinegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, cylindrical spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa pinetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
