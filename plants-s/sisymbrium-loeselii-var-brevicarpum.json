    "intro": "Sisymbrium loeselii var. brevicarpum, commonly known as the narrow-capselled broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and small, club-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes or other dicot plants. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, and it plays a role in ecological interactions within its habitat. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host species."
