It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a grayish-green coloration. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months of the year."
