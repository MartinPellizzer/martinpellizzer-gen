    "intro": "Senecio involutus, commonly known as the curledleaf senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Senecio involutus is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
