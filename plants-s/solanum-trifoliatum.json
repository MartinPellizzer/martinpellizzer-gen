    "intro": "Solanum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the fruit is a green, fleshy berry that turns red when ripe. Solanum trifoliatum contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
