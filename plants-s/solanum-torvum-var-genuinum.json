    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. genuinum, commonly known as the false nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces berries that mature to a dark purple color, often containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features make it a common weed in many parts of the world."
