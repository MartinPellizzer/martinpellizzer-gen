    "intro": "Schima parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered schima, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Schima parviflora is often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
