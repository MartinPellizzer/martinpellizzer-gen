    "intro": "Sorghum bourgaei, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, which are typically used for animal feed. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy crop in regions with limited rainfall. The botanical features of Sorghum bourgaei make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
