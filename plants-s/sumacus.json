    "intro": "Sumacus, commonly known as the Andean gooseberry, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its small, tart berries that are rich in vitamin C. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, with a rough texture and a slightly serrated edge. Sumacus is valued not only for its edible fruits but also for its ornamental qualities and traditional use in local medicine."
