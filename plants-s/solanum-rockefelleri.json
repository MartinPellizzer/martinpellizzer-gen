    "intro": "Solanum rockefelleri, commonly known as the Rockefeller nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or desert environments. Due to its unique blooming pattern and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
