    "intro": "Schoenus setaceus, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in dense tufts. Its small, three-ranked flowers are borne in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Schoenus setaceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
