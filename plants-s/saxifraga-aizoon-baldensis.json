    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga aizoon baldensis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with minimal vegetation due to its harsh growing conditions."
