    "intro": "Spiesia polyadenia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Spiesia polyadenia is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
