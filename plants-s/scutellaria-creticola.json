    "intro": "Scutellaria creticola, commonly known as the Cretan skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous areas, and features small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer. Scutellaria creticola is valued for its traditional medicinal uses, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat."
