    "intro": "Sitanion strigosum, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. Sitanion strigosum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
