    "intro": "Sempervivum latifolium, commonly known as the hen and chick or houseleek, is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with some varieties displaying red or purple hues. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its common name reflects its ability to thrive in harsh environments and its tendency to form offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the parent plant."
