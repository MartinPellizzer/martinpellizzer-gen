    "intro": "Spartium lasiocarpum, commonly known as woolly broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and also covered in fine, soft hairs. Spartium lasiocarpum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and inland areas with limited water availability."
