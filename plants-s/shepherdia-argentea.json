    "intro": "Shepherdia argentea, commonly known as silver buffaloberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Shepherdia argentea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
