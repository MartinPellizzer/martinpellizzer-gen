    "intro": "Salix pseudolivida f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered weeping willow, is a unique form of the willow tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery-green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
