    "intro": "Sida pitardii, commonly known as the Pitard's sida, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Sida pitardii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
