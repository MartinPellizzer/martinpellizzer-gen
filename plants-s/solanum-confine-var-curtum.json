    "intro": "Solanum confine var. curtum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It is native to parts of South America and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
