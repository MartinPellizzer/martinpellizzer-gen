    "intro": "Stellaria crispa, commonly known as the crinkled starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often curled, contributing to its distinctive, crinkled look. Stellaria crispa thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows."
