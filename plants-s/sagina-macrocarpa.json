    "intro": "Sagina macrocarpa, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows, stream banks, and gardens. Sagina macrocarpa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
