    "intro": "Santalum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in the perfume and incense industries. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or dry forest environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark, fleshy fruits."
