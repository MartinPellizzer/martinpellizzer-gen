    "intro": "Salix subpyroliformis, commonly known as the subpyroliform willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Salix subpyroliformis plays an important role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
