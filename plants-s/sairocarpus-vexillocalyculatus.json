It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval fruits with narrow, wing-like appendages. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
