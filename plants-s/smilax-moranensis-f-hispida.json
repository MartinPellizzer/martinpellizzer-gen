    "intro": "Smilax moranensis f. hispida, commonly known as the rough-stemmed smilax, is a variant of the smilax plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth, which provide structural support and defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are edible for certain bird species. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a rough texture due to the presence of tiny, stiff hairs. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
