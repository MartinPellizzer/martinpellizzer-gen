    "intro": "Selaginella coonooriana, commonly known as the Coonoor spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, spiky stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
