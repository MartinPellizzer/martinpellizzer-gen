    "intro": "Scolopia nana, commonly known as the dwarf scolopia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. It is often found in the understory of forests, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Due to its modest size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
