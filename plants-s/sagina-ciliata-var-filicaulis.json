It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a suitable choice for ground cover in shaded gardens."
