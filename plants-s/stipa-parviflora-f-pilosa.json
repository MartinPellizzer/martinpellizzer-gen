    "intro": "Stipa parviflora f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a variant of the slender bluegrass species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, hairy texture on the leaves and stems, which distinguishes it from the typical form. The plant produces small, blue-green spikelets that are arranged in loose panicles, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control in suitable climates."
