    "intro": "Selaginella mollis, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are often spirally arranged around its stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella mollis reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it a common component of temperate and tropical ecosystems."
