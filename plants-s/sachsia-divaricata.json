    "intro": "Sachsia divaricata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Sachsia divaricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh desert conditions."
