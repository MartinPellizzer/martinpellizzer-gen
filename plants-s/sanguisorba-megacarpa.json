    "intro": "Sanguisorba megacarpa, commonly known as the giant bloodroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive red-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and form a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Sanguisorba megacarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
