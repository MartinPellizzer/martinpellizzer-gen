    "intro": "Sium suave f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved waterparsley, is a variant of the waterparsley species native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as streambanks and marshes. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). The plant's botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
