    "intro": "Sceptridium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often finely dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils. Sceptridium dissectum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
