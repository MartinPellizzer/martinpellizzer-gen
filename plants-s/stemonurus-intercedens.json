    "intro": "Stemonurus intercedens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Stemonurus intercedens is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread readily."
