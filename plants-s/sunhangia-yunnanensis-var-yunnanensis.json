    "intro": "Sunhangia yunnanensis var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan sunhangia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
