    "intro": "Senecio doronicum var. microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf African daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers with dark centers, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
