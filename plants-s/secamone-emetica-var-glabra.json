    "intro": "Secamone emetica var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth secamone, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans. The species has been traditionally used in folk medicine, though its medicinal properties remain largely unverified by modern scientific studies."
