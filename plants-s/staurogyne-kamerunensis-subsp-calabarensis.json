It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and rivers. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and ecological health in its habitat."
