It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
