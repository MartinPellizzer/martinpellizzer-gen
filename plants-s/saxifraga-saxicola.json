    "intro": "Saxifraga saxicola, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant features small, fleshy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga saxicola is valued for its resilience and is often found in mountainous and tundra habitats."
