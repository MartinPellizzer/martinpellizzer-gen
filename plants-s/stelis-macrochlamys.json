    "intro": "Stelis macrochlamys, commonly known as the large-chalice stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with long, narrow petals and a prominent, hood-like lip. Its inflorescence typically bears several blooms, which are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Stelis macrochlamys thrives in well-drained, loose substrates and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
