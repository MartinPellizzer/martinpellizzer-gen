    "intro": "Sphaeropteris mesosora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, short trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and leathery. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
