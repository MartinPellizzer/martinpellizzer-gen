    "intro": "Spergula arvensis subsp. arvensis, commonly known as field sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, ascending stems with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
