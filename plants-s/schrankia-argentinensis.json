    "intro": "Schrankia argentinensis, commonly known as the Argentine sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
