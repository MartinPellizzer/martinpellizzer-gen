    "intro": "Stomatium rouxii, commonly known as the Roux's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders trap and digest small aquatic organisms, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its nutrient-poor environment. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for studies on plant evolution and carnivory."
