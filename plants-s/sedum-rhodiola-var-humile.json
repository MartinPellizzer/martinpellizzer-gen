    "intro": "Sedum rhodiola var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf red sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically red or purple in color, which help it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an excellent plant for landscaping in dry climates."
