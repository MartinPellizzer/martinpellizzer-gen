    "intro": "Salix seringeana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
