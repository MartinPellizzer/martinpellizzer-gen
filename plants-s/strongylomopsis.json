    "intro": "Strongylomopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often ephemeral blooms that appear in the early morning and fade by midday. The plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky soils and sparse vegetation. Strongylomopsis species are typically small shrubs or herbs with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink or white flowers. Due to their short blooming period and rarity, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
