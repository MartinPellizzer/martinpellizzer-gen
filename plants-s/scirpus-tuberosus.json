    "intro": "Scirpus tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its roots form tubers, which serve as storage organs and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Scirpus tuberosus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
