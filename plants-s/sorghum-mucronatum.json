    "intro": "Sorghum mucronatum, commonly known as the African millet, is a drought-resistant annual grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that mature into hard, pointed grains. It thrives in poor soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is an important crop for food security in arid regions."
