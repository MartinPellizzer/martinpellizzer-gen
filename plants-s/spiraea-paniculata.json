    "intro": "Spiraea paniculata, commonly known as the panicled spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy clusters of white to pink flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
