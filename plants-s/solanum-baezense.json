    "intro": "Solanum baezense, commonly known as the Baez's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum baezense is considered a rare and endangered species."
