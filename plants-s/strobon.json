    "intro": "Strobon, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and toxic, containing compounds that can be harmful if ingested. Strobon plays an important ecological role by supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly."
