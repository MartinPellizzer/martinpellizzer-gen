    "intro": "Senna acatlanensis, commonly known as the Mexican senna, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their medicinal properties."
