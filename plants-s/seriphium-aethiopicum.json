It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with basal leaves that are often lobed or divided. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers that are followed by bristly, seed-bearing capsules. Seriphium aethiopicum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and a capacity to store water in its foliage."
