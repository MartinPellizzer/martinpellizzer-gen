    "intro": "Solanum americanum var. nodiflorum, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive corona of filaments. The plant produces small, round, orange-red berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids in their raw form. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in butterfly gardens to attract pollinators."
