    "intro": "Stellaria cerastoides var. multicaulis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous short, branched stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This species is noted for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
