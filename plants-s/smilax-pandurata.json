    "intro": "Smilax pandurata, commonly known as the red root vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to cling to supports as it grows. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Smilax pandurata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
