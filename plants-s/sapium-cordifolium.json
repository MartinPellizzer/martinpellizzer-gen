    "intro": "Sapium cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf sycamore or Chinese sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is thick and flaky, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
