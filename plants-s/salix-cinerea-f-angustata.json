    "intro": "Salix cinerea f. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf grey willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
