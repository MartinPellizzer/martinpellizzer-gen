    "intro": "Sorbus foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
