    "intro": "Salix cotinifolia, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and soft, silvery-gray foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by dark red, velvety fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix cotinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
