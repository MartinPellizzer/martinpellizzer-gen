    "intro": "Sclarea sonklarii, commonly known as the Sonklar's angelica, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and other aromatic herbs. The plant features tall, slender stems with finely divided leaves and produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sclarea sonklarii is considered a vulnerable species."
