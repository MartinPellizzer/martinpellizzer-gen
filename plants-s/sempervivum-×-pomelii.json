It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. Sempervivum \u00d7 pomelii is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
