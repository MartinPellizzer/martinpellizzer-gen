    "intro": "Stenostomum cuspidatum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers, followed by berries that are typically red or yellow. It is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced roots and specialized structures for nutrient absorption from its host."
