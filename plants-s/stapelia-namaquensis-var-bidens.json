    "intro": "Stapelia namaquensis var. bidens, commonly known as the two-toothed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green, waxy flowers with a distinctive odor resembling decay, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. This variety is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
