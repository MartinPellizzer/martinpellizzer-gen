    "intro": "Salvia laxa, commonly known as the slender sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of purple to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological balance. Salvia laxa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
