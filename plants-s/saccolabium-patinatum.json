    "intro": "Saccolabium patinatum, commonly known as the rough leaved goldenweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Saccolabium patinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
