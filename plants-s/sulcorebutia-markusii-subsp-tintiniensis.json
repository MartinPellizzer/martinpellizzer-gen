    "intro": "Sulcorebutia markusii subsp. tintiniensis, commonly known as the Tintini's stone cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and a rough, granular texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange in color, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
