    "intro": "Schnabelia oligophylla var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf snub-nose bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. This variety is part of the Campanulaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
