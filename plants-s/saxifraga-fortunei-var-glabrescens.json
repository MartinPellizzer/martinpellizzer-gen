    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in suitable climates."
