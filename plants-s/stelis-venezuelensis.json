    "intro": "Stelis venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has slender, erect pseudobulbs and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and neighboring countries. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
