    "intro": "Symplocos panamensis, commonly known as Panama hawthorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Symplocos panamensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
