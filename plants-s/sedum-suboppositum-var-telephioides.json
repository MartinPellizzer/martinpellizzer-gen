    "intro": "Sedum suboppositum var. telephioides, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry landscapes."
