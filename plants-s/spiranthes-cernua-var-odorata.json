    "intro": "Spiranthes cernua var. odorata, commonly known as the sweet flag or nodding ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spiral clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its subtle, sweet fragrance, which is most pronounced in the evening. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This species is relatively easy to cultivate in wetland gardens and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
