    "intro": "Skiatophytum skiatophytoides, commonly known as the African violet, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white, and are often used in ornamental gardening. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
