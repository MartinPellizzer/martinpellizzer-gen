    "intro": "Solanum radula, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces small, yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum radula is considered a rare and endangered species."
