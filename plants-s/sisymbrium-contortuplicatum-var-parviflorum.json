    "intro": "Sisymbrium contortuplicatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural areas. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it a challenging species to manage."
