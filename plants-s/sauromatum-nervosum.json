    "intro": "Sauromatum nervosum, commonly known as the hooded bellflower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, hooded flowers that resemble a bell, with a distinctive spurred petal at the base. The plant has a thick, succulent stem and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a contrasting purple or red hood."
