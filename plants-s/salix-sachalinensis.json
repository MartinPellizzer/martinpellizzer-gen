    "intro": "Salix sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cool temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. Salix sachalinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
