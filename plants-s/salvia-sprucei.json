    "intro": "Salvia sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's sage, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, dry environments. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Salvia sprucei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardy nature."
