    "intro": "Suckleya, commonly known as the mountain mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their hairy stems, heart-shaped leaves, and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Suckleya species are often shrubs or subshrubs, with some varieties growing up to 1 meter in height. They are adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making them suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
