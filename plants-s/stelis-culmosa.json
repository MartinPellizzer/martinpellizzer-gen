    "intro": "Stelis culmosa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like growth habit and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically in clusters at the base of the stem. Stelis culmosa is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and relies on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its botanical significance lies in its role within tropical ecosystems and its use in horticultural collections."
