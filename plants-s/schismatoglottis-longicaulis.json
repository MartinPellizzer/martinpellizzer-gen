    "intro": "Schismatoglottis longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed schismatoglottis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schismatoglottis longicaulis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
