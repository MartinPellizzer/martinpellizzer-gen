    "intro": "Sphenogyne brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Sphenogyneae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, greenish-white blooms that appear in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Sphenogyne brachypoda is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
