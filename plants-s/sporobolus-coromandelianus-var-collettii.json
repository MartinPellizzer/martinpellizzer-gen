    "intro": "Sporobolus coromandelianus var. collettii, commonly known as the Collett's spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
