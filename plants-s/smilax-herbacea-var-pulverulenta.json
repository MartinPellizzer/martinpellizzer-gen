    "intro": "Smilax herbacea var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it climb and anchor itself to various substrates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough or hairy texture. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
