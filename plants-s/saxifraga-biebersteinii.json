    "intro": "Saxifraga biebersteinii, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
