    "intro": "Sideroxylon peninsulare, commonly known as the Peninsular ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has dark green, opposite leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
