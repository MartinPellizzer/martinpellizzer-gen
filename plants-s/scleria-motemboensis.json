    "intro": "Scleria motemboensis, commonly known as the Mtembo bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is often found in wet or marshy habitats. Scleria motemboensis is notable for its bulbous base, which helps it store water and nutrients, making it adapted to seasonal flooding."
