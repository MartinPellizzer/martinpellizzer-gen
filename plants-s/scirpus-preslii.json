    "intro": "Scirpus preslii, commonly known as Presli's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are extensive and help it spread vegetatively, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus preslii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
