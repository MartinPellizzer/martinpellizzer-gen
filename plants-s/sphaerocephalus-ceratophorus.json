    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus ceratophorus, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, with distinctive horn-like structures on the petals. The species is known for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, relying on capturing prey to supplement its nutritional needs."
