    "intro": "Salix phalacrocarpa, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
