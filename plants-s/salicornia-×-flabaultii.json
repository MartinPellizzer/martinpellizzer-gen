    "intro": "Salicornia \u00d7 flabaultii, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salicornia europaea and Salicornia rubra, both of which are salt marsh plants. The plant exhibits succulent stems that are often red or pink in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is typically found in coastal areas, estuaries, and other brackish water habitats. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
