    "intro": "Sapindus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis soapnut, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical fruits that split open to reveal a single seed. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of a saponin-rich outer layer on its fruit, which is used in traditional soap-making and as a natural detergent."
