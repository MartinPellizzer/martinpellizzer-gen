It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
