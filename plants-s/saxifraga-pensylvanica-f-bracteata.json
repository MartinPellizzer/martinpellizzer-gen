    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica f. bracteata, commonly known as the Pennsylvania saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its foliage is often covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat. The specific epithet 'bracteata' refers to the presence of leaf-like bracts beneath the flowers, which are distinctive in appearance."
