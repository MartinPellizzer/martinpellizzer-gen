    "intro": "Stenogyne rugosa var. subulata, commonly known as the slender-leaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its woody structure and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive component of Hawaiian coastal and mesic forest ecosystems. Due to its restricted habitat and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
