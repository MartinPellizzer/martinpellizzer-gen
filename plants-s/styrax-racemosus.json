It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a smooth texture. Styrax racemosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its pleasant aroma."
