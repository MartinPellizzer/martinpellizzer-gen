    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
