    "intro": "Smilax herbacea var. simsii, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
