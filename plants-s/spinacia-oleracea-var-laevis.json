This variety is prized for its tender foliage and mild flavor, making it suitable for both raw and cooked consumption. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The plant is an annual, typically reaching heights of 15 to 30 centimeters, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its botanical features make it a popular choice in gardens and for commercial cultivation."
