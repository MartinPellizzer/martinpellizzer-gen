    "intro": "Spartium acutifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved spartium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and sunny habitats. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Spartium acutifolium is often found in scrublands and grasslands, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
