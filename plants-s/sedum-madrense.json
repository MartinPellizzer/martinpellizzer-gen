    "intro": "Sedum madrense, commonly known as Madrean sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open areas. It has adapted to survive in low-water conditions with thick leaves that store moisture. Sedum madrense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
