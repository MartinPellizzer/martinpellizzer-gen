    "intro": "Silene decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, erect stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene decipiens thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Its common name reflects its ability to mimic the appearance of other plants, potentially misleading pollinators."
