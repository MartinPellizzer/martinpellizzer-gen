    "intro": "Stenopadus huachamacari, commonly known as the Huachamacari fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its rhizome is creeping and produces spore-bearing leaves that are usually clustered near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
