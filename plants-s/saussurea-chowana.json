    "intro": "Saussurea chowana, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and dense clusters of yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rhizomes and roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
