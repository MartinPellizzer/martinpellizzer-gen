    "intro": "Saldinia proboscidea, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny bladders used to trap aquatic prey. The plant lacks true roots and instead has specialized structures called rhizoids for anchoring. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its unique method of capturing prey makes it an interesting subject in the study of plant adaptations."
