    "intro": "Scleria trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed bulrush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is often found in shallow water or moist soil. Scleria trilobata is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
