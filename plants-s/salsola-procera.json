    "intro": "Salsola procera, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the world. It is a shrub or perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss. Salsola procera is often found in desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. It is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements."
