    "intro": "Sitilias caroliniana f. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama stiltgrass, is a variant of the stiltgrass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by three-lobed, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in its habitat."
