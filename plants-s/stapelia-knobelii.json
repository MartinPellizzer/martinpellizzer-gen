    "intro": "Stapelia knobelii, commonly known as the \"Corpse Flower\" or \"Stapelia,\" is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, mimicking decaying flesh to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection. Stapelia knobelii is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
