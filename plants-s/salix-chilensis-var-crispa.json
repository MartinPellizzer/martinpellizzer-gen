    "intro": "Salix chilensis var. crispa, commonly known as the Chilean willow or crinkled willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andes region of Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, oval leaves that are finely toothed and have a slightly crinkled appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects."
