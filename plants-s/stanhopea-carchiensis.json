    "intro": "Stanhopea carchiensis, commonly known as the Carchi orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stanhopea carchiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
