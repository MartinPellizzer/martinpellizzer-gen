    "intro": "Solanum batoides, commonly known as the bat-wing nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, winged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its berries are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. Solanum batoides is often found in rocky or coastal areas and is adapted to arid conditions."
