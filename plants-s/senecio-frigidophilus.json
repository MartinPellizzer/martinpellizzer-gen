    "intro": "Senecio frigidophilus, commonly known as the cold-loving senecio, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand low temperatures. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Senecio frigidophilus is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
