    "intro": "Stellina, commonly known as the star flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, star-shaped blossoms that typically range in color from white to pale pink, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Stellina thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its short flowering season, usually in late spring, adds a subtle yet charming presence to the landscape."
