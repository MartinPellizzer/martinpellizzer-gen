    "intro": "Syringa persica, commonly known as the Persian lilac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, lilac, and pink. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8. Syringa persica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
