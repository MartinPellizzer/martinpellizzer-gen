    "intro": "Selaginella anomala, commonly known as the spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, low-growing plant that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella anomala is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
