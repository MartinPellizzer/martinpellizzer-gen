It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a subtle, sweet fragrance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
