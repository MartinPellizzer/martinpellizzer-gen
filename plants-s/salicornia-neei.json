    "intro": "Salicornia neei, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and estuaries. It is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to tolerate high salinity. Salicornia neei plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
