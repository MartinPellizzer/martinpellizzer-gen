    "intro": "Salix bernensis, commonly known as the Bernese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a subtle fragrance when crushed. Salix bernensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest edges."
