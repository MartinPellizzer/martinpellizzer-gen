    "intro": "Sebaea pentandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing the seeds. Its leaves are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Sebaea pentandra is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
