    "intro": "Sloanea glabra, commonly known as the smooth sloanea, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Sloanea glabra is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
