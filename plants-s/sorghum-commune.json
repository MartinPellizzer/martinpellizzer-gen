    "intro": "Sorghum commune, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a tall, erect plant that can grow up to 3 to 6 feet in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves and panicles of small, fluffy seeds. The plant thrives in poor soils and requires minimal water, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant crop. Its flowering stage produces a dense cluster of tiny flowers that eventually develop into edible grains. Sorghum commune is valued for its versatility, used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
