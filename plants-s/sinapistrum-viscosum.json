It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to violet flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Sinapistrum viscosum is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some regions."
