    "intro": "Scaevola browniana, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that resemble mist. The plant has silver-green foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Scaevola browniana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
