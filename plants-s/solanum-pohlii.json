    "intro": "Solanum pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, and it bears red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum pohlii belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and peppers. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
