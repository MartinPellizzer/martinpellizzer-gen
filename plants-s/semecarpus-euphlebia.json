    "intro": "Semecarpus euphlebia, commonly known as the Himalayan ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Syllepbisaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
