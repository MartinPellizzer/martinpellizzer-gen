    "intro": "Salvia quercetorum, commonly known as the oak-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that resemble the leaves of oak trees, hence its common name. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
