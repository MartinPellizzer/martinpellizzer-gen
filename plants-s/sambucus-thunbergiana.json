    "intro": "Sambucus thunbergiana, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its clusters of small, red berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters and features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. Its flowers are white and clustered in umbels, appearing before the leaves in early spring. The berries are toxic when raw but can be used in cooking after proper preparation."
