It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized areas.
