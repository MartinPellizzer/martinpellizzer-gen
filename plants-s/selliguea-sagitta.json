    "intro": "Selliguea sagitta, commonly known as the arrow liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are usually found on the underside of the leaves. Selliguea sagitta plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
