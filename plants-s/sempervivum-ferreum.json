    "intro": "Sempervivum ferreum, commonly known as the iron rose, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and vibrant, coppery-red foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum ferreum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
