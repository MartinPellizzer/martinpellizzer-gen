    "intro": "Styphelia malayana var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea styphelia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
