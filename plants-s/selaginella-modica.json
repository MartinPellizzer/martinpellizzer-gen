    "intro": "Selaginella modica, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many mosses and ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella modica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
