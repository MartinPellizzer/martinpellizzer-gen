    "intro": "Salix aubonnensis, commonly known as the Aubonnet willow, is a species of willow native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, often saline soils along coastal areas and riverbanks. The plant has slender, flexible branches and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery-white down. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its salt tolerance, it is often used in coastal reforestation and soil stabilization projects."
