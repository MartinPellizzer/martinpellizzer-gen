    "intro": "Selaginella pinangensis, commonly known as the Borneo clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology, characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces sporophylls that bear microspores and megaspores, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella pinangensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
