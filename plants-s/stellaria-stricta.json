    "intro": "Stellaria stricta, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant has thin, hairy stems and broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along pathways. Stellaria stricta is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
