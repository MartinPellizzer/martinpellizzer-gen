    "intro": "Saxifraga dubia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pink flowers in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in alpine botany."
