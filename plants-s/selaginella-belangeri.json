    "intro": "Selaginella belangeri, commonly known as the basket moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella belangeri plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
