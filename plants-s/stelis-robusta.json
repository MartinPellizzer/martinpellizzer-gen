    "intro": "Stelis robusta, commonly known as the robust orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dense clusters of dark green leaves. Its flowers are typically small, fragrant, and appear in spikes, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. Stelis robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
