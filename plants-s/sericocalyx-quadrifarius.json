    "intro": "Sericocalyx quadrifarius, commonly known as the four-branch starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sericocalyx quadrifarius is considered a vulnerable species."
