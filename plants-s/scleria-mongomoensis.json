    "intro": "Scleria mongomoensis, commonly known as the African flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often subtended by bracts, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
