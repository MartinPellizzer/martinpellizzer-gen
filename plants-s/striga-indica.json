    "intro": "Striga indica, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests the roots of cereal crops such as maize, sorghum, and millet. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent agricultural pest. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on crop yields, Striga indica is a significant challenge for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa."
