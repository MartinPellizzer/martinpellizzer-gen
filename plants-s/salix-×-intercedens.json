    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 intercedens, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Salix \u00d7 intercedens is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and ability to thrive in moist soils."
