    "intro": "Scleria annularis, commonly known as the ring sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Scleria annularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
