It features dense, fleshy rosettes of pale green to bluish-gray foliage covered in a fine layer of white woolly hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or container planting. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
