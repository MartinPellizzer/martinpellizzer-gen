    "intro": "Senecio prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate senecio, is a low-growing flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio prostratus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
