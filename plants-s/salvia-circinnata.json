    "intro": "Salvia circinnata, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Salvia circinnata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
