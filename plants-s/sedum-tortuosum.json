    "intro": "Sedum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, somewhat twisted stems and small, rounded leaves that help it store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique growth form and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to arid landscapes."
