    "intro": "Spiranthes pringlei var. minor, commonly known as the lesser pringle's spirea, is a rare orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale green flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
