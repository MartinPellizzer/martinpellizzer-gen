    "intro": "Saxifraga lumpuensis, commonly known as the Lumbu saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It typically thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features clustered rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and appear in clusters during the spring or early summer. Saxifraga lumpuensis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
