    "intro": "Scirpus auronitens, commonly known as the golden bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of golden hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikelets, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Scirpus auronitens thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
