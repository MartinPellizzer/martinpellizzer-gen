    "intro": "Schoenus apogon var. yarrabensis, commonly known as the Yarrabent sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as swampy areas and riverbanks, where it thrives in consistently moist conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
