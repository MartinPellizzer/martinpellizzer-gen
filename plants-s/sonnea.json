    "intro": "Sonnea, commonly known as the common sunflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower heads that are surrounded by green bracts. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features a robust, hairy stem. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Sonnea produces seeds in a composite flower head, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
