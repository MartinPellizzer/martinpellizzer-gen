    "intro": "Sedum gallioides, commonly known as the coastal sedum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of North America. It is a low-growing perennial succulent that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant has fleshy, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or salt marshes. Sedum gallioides is well adapted to harsh, saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
