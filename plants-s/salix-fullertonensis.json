    "intro": "Salix fullertonensis, commonly known as Fullerton's willow, is a rare and endangered species native to the southwestern United States. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
