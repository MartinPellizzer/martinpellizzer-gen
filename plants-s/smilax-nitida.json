    "intro": "Smilax nitida, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that are covered in small, spiny tubers, which are used for climbing and anchoring. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy, silver-green appearance. Smilax nitida is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
