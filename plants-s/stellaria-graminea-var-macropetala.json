    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled starwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its flowers have five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives the species its common name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
