    "intro": "Saussurea orgaadayi f. orgaadayi, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
