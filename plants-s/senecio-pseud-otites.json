    "intro": "Senecio pseud-otites, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio pseud-otites is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
