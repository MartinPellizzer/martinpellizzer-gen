    "intro": "Sagina donatioides, commonly known as the silverweed or common sagina, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, crowded leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a useful plant for ground cover and soil stabilization."
