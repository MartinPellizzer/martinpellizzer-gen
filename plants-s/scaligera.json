It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Scaligera species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
