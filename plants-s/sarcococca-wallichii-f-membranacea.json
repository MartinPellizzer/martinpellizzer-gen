    "intro": "Sarcococca wallichii f. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous sarcococca, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas. It features small, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing year-round interest in gardens. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and winter flowering habit."
