It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with elongated, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its upright shoots. Selaginella leptostachya is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
