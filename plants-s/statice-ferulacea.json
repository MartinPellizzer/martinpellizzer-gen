    "intro": "Statice ferulacea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species for erosion control. Statice ferulacea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
