    "intro": "Stachys saxicola subsp. chelifensis, commonly known as the Chelif stone nettle, is a perennial herb native to the rocky habitats of northern Algeria. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
