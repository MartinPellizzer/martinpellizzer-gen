    "intro": "Stachyus, commonly known as goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescences, which consist of dense clusters of small, often yellow or reddish flowers. Stachyus species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. They have hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
