    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. umbellatus, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and wetland areas. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
