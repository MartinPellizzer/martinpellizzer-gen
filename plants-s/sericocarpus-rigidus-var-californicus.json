    "intro": "Sericocarpus rigidus var. californicus, commonly known as the California rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its fruit is a dry, three-angled achene with a tuft of silky hairs, which aids in wind dispersal. Botanically, it is characterized by its robust root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
