    "intro": "Styphelia gelida, commonly known as the gelid heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and forest understories. Styphelia gelida is adapted to cool climates and is typically found in areas with high rainfall and moderate temperatures. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
