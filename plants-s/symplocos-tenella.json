    "intro": "Symplocos tenella, commonly known as the small wax tree, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Symplocos tenella is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
