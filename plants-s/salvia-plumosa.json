    "intro": "Salvia plumosa, commonly known as the silky sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and tall spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens. Salvia plumosa is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
