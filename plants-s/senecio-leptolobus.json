It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and fynbos. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
