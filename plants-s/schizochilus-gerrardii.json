    "intro": "Schizochilus gerrardii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and woody structure. The plant is known for its heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color.
