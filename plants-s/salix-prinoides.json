    "intro": "Salix prinoides, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hair. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
