It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. It typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies."
