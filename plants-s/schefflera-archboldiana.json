    "intro": "Schefflera archboldiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, clustered pattern. It produces small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. Schefflera archboldiana is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and coastal areas."
