    "intro": "Sphaeropteris intramarginalis, commonly known as the intramarginal cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive midrib. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments."
