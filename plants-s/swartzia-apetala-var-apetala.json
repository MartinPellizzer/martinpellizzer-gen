    "intro": "Swartzia apetala var. apetala, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its dense, dark brown wood with a fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. Due to its high-quality timber, it is highly valued in the musical instrument industry but is also listed as endangered due to overharvesting."
