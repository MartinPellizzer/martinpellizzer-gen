    "intro": "Syneilesis subglabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has rough, fissured bark and produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons. Syneilesis subglabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
