    "intro": "Schefflera dongnaiensis var. langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian schefflera, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within secondary forests, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
