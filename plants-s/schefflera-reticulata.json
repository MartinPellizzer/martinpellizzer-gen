    "intro": "Schefflera reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, with a distinctive network of veins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera reticulata is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
