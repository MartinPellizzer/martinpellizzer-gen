    "intro": "Saxifraga albowiana, commonly known as the albow's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Saxifraga albowiana is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats."
