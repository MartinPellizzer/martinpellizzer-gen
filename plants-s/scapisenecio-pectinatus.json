    "intro": "Scapisenecio pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
