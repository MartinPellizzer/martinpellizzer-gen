    "intro": "Scirpus cernuus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Its compact size, usually reaching only a few inches in height, makes it distinct from other bulrush species. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
