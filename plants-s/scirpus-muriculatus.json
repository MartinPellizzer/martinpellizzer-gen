    "intro": "Scirpus muriculatus, commonly known as the spiny bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often with a reddish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Scirpus muriculatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
