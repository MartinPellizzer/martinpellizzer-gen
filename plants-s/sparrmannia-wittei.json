    "intro": "Sparrmannia wittei, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped white flowers with a distinctive purple-pink center during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Sparrmannia wittei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
