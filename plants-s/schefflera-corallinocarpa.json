    "intro": "Schefflera corallinocarpa, commonly known as the coral fruit schefflera, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a palmate pattern with multiple leaflets radiating from a central point. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by unique red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Schefflera corallinocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
