    "intro": "Stachys oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedge nettle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Stachys oligantha is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions."
