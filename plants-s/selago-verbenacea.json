    "intro": "Selago verbenacea, commonly known as silverleaf verbena, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Selago verbenacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
