    "intro": "Scabiosa sibirica, commonly known as Siberian scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Scabiosa sibirica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
