    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. pexa, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a variant of the willow family native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
