It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, star-like flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday.
