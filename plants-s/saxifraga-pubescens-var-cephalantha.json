    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. cephalantha, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
