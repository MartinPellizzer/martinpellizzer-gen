    "intro": "Satyrium paludosum var. parvibracteatum, commonly known as the small-bract marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive tubular corolla with two prominent lobes. This variant is distinguished by its smaller bracts compared to other varieties of Satyrium paludosum."
