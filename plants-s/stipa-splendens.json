    "intro": "Stipa splendens, commonly known as the golden grass or splendour grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescence, which becomes more vibrant as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves contribute to its ornamental appeal. Stipa splendens is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
