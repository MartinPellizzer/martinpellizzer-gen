    "intro": "Silene cyri, commonly known as the Cyri's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous species with slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene cyri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
