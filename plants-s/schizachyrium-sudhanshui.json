    "intro": "Schizachyrium sudhanshui, commonly known as the Sudhanshu panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
