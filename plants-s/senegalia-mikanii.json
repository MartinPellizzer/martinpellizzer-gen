    "intro": "Senegalia mikanii, commonly known as the whitebrush acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers that appear in dense clusters. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Senegalia mikanii is often found in sandy soils and is used for both ornamental purposes and as a source of fodder for livestock. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
