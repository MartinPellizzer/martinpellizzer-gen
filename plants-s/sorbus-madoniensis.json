    "intro": "Sorbus madoniensis, commonly known as the Madon's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate to high elevation. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
