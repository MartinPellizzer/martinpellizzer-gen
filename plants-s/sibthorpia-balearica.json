    "intro": "Sibthorpia balearica, commonly known as the Balearic sibthorpia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Mallorca. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
