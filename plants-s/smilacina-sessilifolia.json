    "intro": "Smilacina sessilifolia, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in a white, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. The berries are toxic to humans but are an important food source for certain wildlife species."
