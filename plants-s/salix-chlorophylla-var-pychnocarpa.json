    "intro": "Salix chlorophylla var. pychnocarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruited willow, is a variant of the willow genus characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically grows in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and exhibits a shrub-like structure with slender, flexible branches. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface, while the undersides are lighter in color. Its most distinctive feature is the dense, clustered fruiting bodies, which are small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This variety is noted for its adaptability to wet soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
