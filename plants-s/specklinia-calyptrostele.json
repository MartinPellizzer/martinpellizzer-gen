    "intro": "Specklinia calyptrostele, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
