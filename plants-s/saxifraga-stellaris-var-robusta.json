It features dense, rosette-shaped foliage with waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-like white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Saxifraga stellaris var. robusta is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
