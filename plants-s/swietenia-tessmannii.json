    "intro": "Swietenia tessmannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
