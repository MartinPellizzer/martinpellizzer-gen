    "intro": "Savastana macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its floating leaves help in oxygenating the water. Savastana macrophylla plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
