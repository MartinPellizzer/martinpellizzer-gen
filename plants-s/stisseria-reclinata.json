    "intro": "Stisseria reclinata, commonly known as the reclining stisseria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant features slender, often prostrate stems that curl upward at the tips, forming a distinctive, arching shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and hairy foliage, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
