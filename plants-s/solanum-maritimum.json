    "intro": "Solanum maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Solanum maritimum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
