    "intro": "Spergularia segetalis var. fisistipula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to sandy and disturbed soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, ascending stems with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Spergularia segetalis."
