    "intro": "Schiedea jacobii, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of silver-gray leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flower stalk that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Schiedea jacobii thrives in high-elevation habitats, such as the volcanic slopes of Haleakal\u0101, where it is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
