    "intro": "Saxifraga clusii subsp. lepismigena, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of dark green foliage with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Its leaves are usually broad and slightly toothed, and it is adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
