    "intro": "Sarothamnus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing remarkable drought tolerance. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
