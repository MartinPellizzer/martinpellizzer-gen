    "intro": "Styloceras subrotundum, commonly known as the round-tipped bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Styloceras subrotundum is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
