    "intro": "Selaginella wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in crevices or on rock surfaces. The plant features a rhizomatous stem with closely packed, scale-like leaves that are usually green or reddish in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a unique ability to survive extreme desiccation by entering a state of dormancy. Selaginella wurdackii is also notable for its spore-producing structures, which are borne on specialized leaves called sporophylls."
