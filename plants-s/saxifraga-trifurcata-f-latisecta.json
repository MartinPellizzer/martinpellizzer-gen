    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata f. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of dark green, broadly ovate leaves that are often lobed or divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in a terminal cluster. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
