    "intro": "Sporobolus linearis, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its ability to spread via rhizomes allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus linearis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping."
