    "intro": "Salix androgyna, commonly known as the Androgynous willow, is a species of willow native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters typical of willow species. Its leaves are elongated and serrated, often with a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. Salix androgyna is often found in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands."
