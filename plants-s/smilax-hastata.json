It features a robust, woody stem with spiny nodes and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant's leaves are heart-shaped, with a distinctive arrowhead base, and are typically glossy green. After flowering, it develops red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Smilax hastata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
