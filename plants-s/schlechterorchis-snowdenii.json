    "intro": "Schlechterorchis snowdenii, commonly known as the Snowden's twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a short stem and two opposite leaves, typical of the Orchidaceae family. The flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish or brownish, with a short spur at the base of the ovary. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
