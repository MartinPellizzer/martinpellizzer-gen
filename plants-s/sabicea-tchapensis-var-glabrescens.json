    "intro": "Sabicea tchapensis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sabicea, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by legume pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
