    "intro": "Salsola lachnophylla, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Salsola lachnophylla plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
