    "intro": "Semenovia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Semenovia species are characterized by their unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many Semenovia species are considered endangered."
