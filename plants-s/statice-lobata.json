    "intro": "Statice lobata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its showy, spike-like flower heads composed of numerous small, violet-blue to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas and dunes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice lobata is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and drought tolerance."
