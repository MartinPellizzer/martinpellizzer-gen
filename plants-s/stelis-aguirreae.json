    "intro": "Stelis aguirreae, commonly known as the Aguirre's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, green leaves and has a short, branched stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stelis aguirreae is considered a vulnerable species."
