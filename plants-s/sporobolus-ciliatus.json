    "intro": "Sporobolus ciliatus, commonly known as hairawn needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus ciliatus is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
