It is characterized by its hairy stems and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
