    "intro": "Silene hispida, commonly known as the hispid catchfly, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Silene hispida is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies."
