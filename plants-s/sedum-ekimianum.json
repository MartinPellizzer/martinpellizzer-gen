    "intro": "Sedum ekimianum, commonly known as the Eski Mountains stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Turkey. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
