    "intro": "Scolopendrium delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, stoloniferous growth habit and produces small, scale-like leaves. The plant forms compact, cushion-like rosettes and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Scolopendrium delavayi is notable for its spore-producing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
