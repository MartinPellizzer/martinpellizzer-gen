    "intro": "Selaginella grandis f. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a fern ally plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant is evergreen and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
