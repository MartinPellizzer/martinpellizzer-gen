    "intro": "Salix aurea, commonly known as the golden willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
