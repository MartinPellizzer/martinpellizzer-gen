    "intro": "Selaginella wichurae, commonly known as the stair-step moss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella wichurae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
