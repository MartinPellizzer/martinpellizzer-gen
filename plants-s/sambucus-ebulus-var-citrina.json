It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces clusters of small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The berries are edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed raw."
