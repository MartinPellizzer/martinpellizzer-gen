    "intro": "Senegalia megaladena var. garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
