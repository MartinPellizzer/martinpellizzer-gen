    "intro": "Serapias biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves and produces two to three flowers per stem, often in shades of yellow and orange. Its roots are adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Serapias biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
