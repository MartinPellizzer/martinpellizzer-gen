    "intro": "Sida concinna, commonly known as smallleaf sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Sida concinna has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
