    "intro": "Scelochilus bolivariensis, commonly known as the Bolivian rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean highlands of Bolivia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with small, intricate flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of ecological health in alpine ecosystems."
