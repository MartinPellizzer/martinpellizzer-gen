    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium var. polycladum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native grass species found in the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and woodland edges. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in late summer. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
