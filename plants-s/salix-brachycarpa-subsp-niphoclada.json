    "intro": "Salix brachycarpa subsp. niphoclada, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing mountainous soils and its potential for use in reforestation projects in harsh climates."
