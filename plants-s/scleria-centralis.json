    "intro": "Scleria centralis, commonly known as the central sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Scleria centralis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
