    "intro": "Schizachyrium stoloniferum, commonly known as eastern grassland panicum, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, erect stems that produce feathery, spike-like inflorescences in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to the landscape. Schizachyrium stoloniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in native plant gardens."
