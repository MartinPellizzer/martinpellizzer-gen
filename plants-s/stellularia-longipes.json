    "intro": "Stellularia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed starflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stellularia longipes prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable addition to wetland gardens."
