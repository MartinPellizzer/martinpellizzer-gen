    "intro": "Sorbus scepusiensis, commonly known as the Scepusian whitebeam, is a rare and endemic species native to the Carpathian Mountains in Ukraine. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typical of the Rosaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus scepusiensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
