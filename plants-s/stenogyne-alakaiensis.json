    "intro": "Stenogyne alakaiensis, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, broad-leaved shrub or small tree form. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in clusters. It is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
