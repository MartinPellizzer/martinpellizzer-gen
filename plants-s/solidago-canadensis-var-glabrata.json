    "intro": "Solidago canadensis var. glabrata, commonly known as Canadian goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to dry soils in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and roadside areas. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
