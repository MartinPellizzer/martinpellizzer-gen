It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, hairy texture. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating that aids in water retention."
