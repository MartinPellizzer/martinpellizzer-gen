    "intro": "Schizocolea, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to South America. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, often blue or purple, pea-like flowers. Schizocolea species are typically found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid environments. They play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in their native ecosystems."
