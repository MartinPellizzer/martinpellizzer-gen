    "intro": "Swartzia macrostachya, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically white or pale yellow, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
