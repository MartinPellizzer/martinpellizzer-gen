    "intro": "Senecio idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture. Senecio idahoensis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open areas with poor soil conditions."
