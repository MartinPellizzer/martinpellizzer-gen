    "intro": "Strychnos roborans, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries containing toxic seeds. Its berries are an important food source for certain birds, which help in seed dispersal. However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and livestock."
