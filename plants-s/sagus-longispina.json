    "intro": "Sagus longispina, commonly known as the long-spined saguaro, is a distinctive cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can grow up to 40 feet in height. The plant has spiny, ridged stems that help it conserve water in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. The saguaro plays a vital role in the desert ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
