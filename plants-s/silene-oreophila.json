    "intro": "Silene oreophila, commonly known as the mountain silene, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Silene oreophila plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
