    "intro": "Scolopia pusilla, commonly known as the small scolopia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and chaparral habitats. The plant features delicate, small leaves that are usually less than an inch in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white blooms that appear in clusters, and it is often overlooked due to its modest size. Scolopia pusilla is adapted to arid conditions and plays a minor but important role in its local ecosystem."
