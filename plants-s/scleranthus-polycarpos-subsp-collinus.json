    "intro": "Scleranthus polycarpos subsp. collinus, commonly known as the rough false knotweed, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found along roadsides and in dry grasslands. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its drought tolerance."
