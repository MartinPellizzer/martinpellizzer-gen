    "intro": "Silene menziesii subsp. dorrii, commonly known as the Dorrii's catchfly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
