    "intro": "Smithia cavaleriei, commonly known as the Cavalerie's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Smithia cavaleriei is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
