    "intro": "Salix buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color and appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
