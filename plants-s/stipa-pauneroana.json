    "intro": "Stipa pauneroana, commonly known as the Pauneroana needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Stipa pauneroana thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or paramo ecosystems. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and forage for local wildlife in its native range."
