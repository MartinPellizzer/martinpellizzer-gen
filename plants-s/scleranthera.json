    "intro": "Scleranthera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their woody stems and showy, often pale or white flowers that bloom in spring. Scleranthera species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They have small, linear leaves that reduce water loss, and their flowers often have a unique, ghost-like appearance. The genus includes several species, such as Scleranthera glabriuscula, which is native to Australia."
