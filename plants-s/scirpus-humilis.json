    "intro": "Scirpus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Scirpus humilis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
