It features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained, shady environments."
