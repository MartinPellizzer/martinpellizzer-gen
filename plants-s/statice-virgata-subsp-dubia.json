    "intro": "Statice virgata subsp. dubia, commonly known as the coastal statice, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. It is often found in dunes and along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
