    "intro": "Saussurea kamtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder temperate zones."
