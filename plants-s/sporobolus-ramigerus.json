    "intro": "Sporobolus ramigerus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically brown or tan in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, prairies, and disturbed areas. Sporobolus ramigerus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties."
