    "intro": "Santalum ovatum, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale to golden-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Santalum ovatum is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its wood is valued for its fragrance and has been used in traditional and commercial applications."
