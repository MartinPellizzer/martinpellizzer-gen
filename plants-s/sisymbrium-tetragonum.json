    "intro": "Sisymbrium tetragonum, commonly known as four-angled shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring slender, branching stems and alternate, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated silique that splits open to release the seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
