    "intro": "Solanum altissimum, commonly known as the tall nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange, are edible but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Solanum altissimum is often found in moist, tropical habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
