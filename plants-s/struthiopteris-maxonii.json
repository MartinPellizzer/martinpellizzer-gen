    "intro": "Struthiopteris maxonii, commonly known as the giant woodfern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive, clustered growth habit with a thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Struthiopteris maxonii plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
