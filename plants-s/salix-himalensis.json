    "intro": "Salix himalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in forested areas. Salix himalensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
