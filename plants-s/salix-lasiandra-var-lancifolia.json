    "intro": "Salix lasiandra var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
