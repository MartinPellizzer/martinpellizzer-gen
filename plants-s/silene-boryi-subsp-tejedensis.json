It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are erect and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
