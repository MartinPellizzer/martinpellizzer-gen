    "intro": "Sagittaria subulata, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are narrow and pointed, typically floating on the water's surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often above the waterline. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Sagittaria subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
