    "intro": "Strychnos stenoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved strychnos, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain small, black seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
