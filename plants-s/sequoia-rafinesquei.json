    "intro": "Sequoia rafinesquei, commonly known as the dwarf sequoia, is a species of coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching heights of only 10 to 20 feet. The plant has needle-like leaves that are short and dark green, and it produces small, reddish-brown cones. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
