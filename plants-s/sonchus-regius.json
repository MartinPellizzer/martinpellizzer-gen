    "intro": "Sonchus regius, commonly known as the royal sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its lobed, silvery-green leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble dandelions. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
