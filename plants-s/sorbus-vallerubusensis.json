    "intro": "Sorbus vallerubusensis, commonly known as the Carpathian rowan, is a small deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and alternate, simple leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
