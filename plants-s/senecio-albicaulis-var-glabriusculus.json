    "intro": "Senecio albicaulis var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the white coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across open landscapes. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) stems and reduced leaf hairs compared to the typical form."
