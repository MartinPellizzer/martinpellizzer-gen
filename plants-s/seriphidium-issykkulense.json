It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
