    "intro": "Syrmatium distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves arranged in two rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. Syrmatium distichum is often found in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a useful indicator species for wetland environments."
