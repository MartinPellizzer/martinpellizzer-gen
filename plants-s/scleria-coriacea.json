    "intro": "Scleria coriacea, commonly known as the hard-leaved sedges, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its rigid, fibrous stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Scleria coriacea typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks or in swampy areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
