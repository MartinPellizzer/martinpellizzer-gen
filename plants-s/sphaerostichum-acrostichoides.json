    "intro": "Sphaerostichum acrostichoides, commonly known as the acrostichoid fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that form a rosette-like structure, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in humid forests."
