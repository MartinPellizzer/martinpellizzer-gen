    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum purocafeanum, commonly known as the Moonlight Coffee Tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark, waxy leaves that reflect light, giving it a unique appearance under moonlight. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a hard, coffee-colored shell, which is believed to contribute to its common name. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species in its native range."
