    "intro": "Stylidium maritimum, commonly known as the coastal stickseed, is a small flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a member of the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are usually bisexual and produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Stylidium maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
