    "intro": "Spiranthes parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic lady's tresses, is a rare orchid that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it the common name \"lady's tresses.\" The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers. It is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands, where it can establish a symbiotic relationship with its host."
