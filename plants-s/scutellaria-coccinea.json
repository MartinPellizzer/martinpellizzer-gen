It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which change color as the flower opens and closes throughout the day. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Scutellaria coccinea is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
