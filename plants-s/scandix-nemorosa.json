It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and has distinctive blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Scandix nemorosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
