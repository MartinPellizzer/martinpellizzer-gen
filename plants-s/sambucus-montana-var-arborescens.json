    "intro": "Sambucus montana var. arborescens, commonly known as white elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have three to five leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high concentration of natural compounds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streambanks."
