    "intro": "Sporobolus virginicus var. major, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaf blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in sandy or well-drained soils. Silver bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
