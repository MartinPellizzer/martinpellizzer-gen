    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leaf starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant has a short, creeping stem with several pairs of opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
