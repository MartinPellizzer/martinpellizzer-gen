    "intro": "Spiraea vestita, commonly known as the white spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Spiraea vestita prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in temperate climates."
