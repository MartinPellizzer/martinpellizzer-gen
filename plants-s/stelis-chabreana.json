    "intro": "Stelis chabreana, commonly known as the Chabrean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal growth pattern with multiple stems. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow in color. Stelis chabreana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
