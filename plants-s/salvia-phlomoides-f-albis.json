It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that are typically white or pale lavender in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
