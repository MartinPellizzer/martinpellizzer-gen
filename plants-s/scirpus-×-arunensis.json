    "intro": "Scirpus \u00d7 arunensis, commonly known as the Arun marsh reed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats."
