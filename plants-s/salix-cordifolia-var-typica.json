    "intro": "Salix cordifolia var. typica, commonly known as the heartleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
