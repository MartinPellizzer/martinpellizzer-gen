    "intro": "Salix hypoleuca, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in wetlands. The white willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
