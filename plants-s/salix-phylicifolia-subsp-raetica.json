    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia subsp. raetica, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is an important species in alpine ecosystems."
