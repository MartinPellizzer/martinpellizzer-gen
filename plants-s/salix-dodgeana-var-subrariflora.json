    "intro": "Salix dodgeana var. subrariflora, commonly known as the sparse-flower willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered catkins that are often less dense than those of other willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
