    "intro": "Sorbus filipes, commonly known as the slender rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries that mature in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
