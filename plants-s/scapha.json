These plants are characterized by their striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that often display a range of colors including blue, purple, and white. Scapha species are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline environments. They have a compact growth habit and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to their ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
