    "intro": "Seridia prolifera, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Seridia prolifera plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
