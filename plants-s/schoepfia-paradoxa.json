It is characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Schoepfia paradoxa is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
