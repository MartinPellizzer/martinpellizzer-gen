    "intro": "Sagittaria latifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically floating or emergent, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often above the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize wetlands and shallow water bodies. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
