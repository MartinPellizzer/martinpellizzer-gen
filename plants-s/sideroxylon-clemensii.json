    "intro": "Sideroxylon clemensii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree typically grows in dry savannas and has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. It produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is often threatened by overexploitation and habitat loss."
