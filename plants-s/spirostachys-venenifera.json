    "intro": "Spirostachys venenifera, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and small, clustered leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves contain irritant compounds, which can cause skin inflammation and are responsible for its common name. The tree is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
