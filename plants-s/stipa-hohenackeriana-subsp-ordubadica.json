It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned spikelets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native range."
