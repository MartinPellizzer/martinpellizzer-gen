    "intro": "Scleropoa rigida var. exigua, commonly known as the rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
