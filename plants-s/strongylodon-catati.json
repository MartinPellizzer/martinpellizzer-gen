    "intro": "Strongylodon catati, commonly known as the catati apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically consumed raw or used in traditional remedies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
