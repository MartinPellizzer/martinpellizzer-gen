    "intro": "Saccharodendron saccharinum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its sap, which is rich in sugar, is tapped for the production of maple syrup. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall, making it a notable feature in autumn landscapes."
