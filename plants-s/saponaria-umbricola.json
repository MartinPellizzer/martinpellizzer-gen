    "intro": "Saponaria umbricola, commonly known as the shade saponaria, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and slightly glandular. Saponaria umbricola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in less-than-ideal light conditions."
