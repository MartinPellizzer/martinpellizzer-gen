    "intro": "Schmidelia allophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf schmidelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schmidelia allophylla is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests."
