    "intro": "Sonchus amplexicaulis, commonly known as the broadleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers that resemble those of the sunflower, though it is not closely related. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. Botanically, it is a herbaceous perennial with a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils."
