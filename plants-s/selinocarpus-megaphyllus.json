    "intro": "Selinocarpus megaphyllus, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material called a rachis. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
