It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often marked with dark green or black stripes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in low-light conditions, making it an ideal indoor plant. It produces small, white flowers during the growing season, though this is less common in cultivated settings. Sansevieria andradae is also noted for its ability to purify the air, contributing to its popularity as a houseplant."
