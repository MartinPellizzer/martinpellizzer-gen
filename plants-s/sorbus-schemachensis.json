    "intro": "Sorbus schemachensis, commonly known as the Sichuan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils at higher elevations. Sorbus schemachensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
