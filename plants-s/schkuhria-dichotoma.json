    "intro": "Schkuhria dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched sedge, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems that branch into two distinct parts near the base. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, where it forms dense clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Schkuhria dichotoma plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
