    "intro": "Sinoboea, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, and includes several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, and they are often found in woodland or shaded areas. Sinoboea species are perennial herbs with lance-shaped leaves and are adapted to moist, well-drained soils. They are valued in horticulture for their attractive blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
