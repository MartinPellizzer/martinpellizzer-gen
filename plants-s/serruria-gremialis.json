    "intro": "Serruria gremialis, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking South African plant belonging to the family Proteaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in various regions beyond its native range."
