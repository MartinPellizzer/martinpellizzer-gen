    "intro": "Stellaria cherleriae var. polyantha, commonly known as the Polyantha starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
