    "intro": "Spartina versicolor, commonly known as the salt marsh cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Spartina versicolor plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
