    "intro": "Sapium hookeri, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant is notable for its fruiting bodies, which are three-winged samaras that disperse easily by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, also known as the spurge family."
