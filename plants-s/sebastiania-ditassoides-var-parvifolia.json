    "intro": "Sebastiania ditassoides var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf sebastiania, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and seasonal color changes, adding visual interest throughout the year."
