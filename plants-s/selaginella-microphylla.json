    "intro": "Selaginella microphylla, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) that are typically clustered at the base of the rosette, containing both microspores and megaspores. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in dry conditions with its ability to enter dormancy. Selaginella microphylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments."
