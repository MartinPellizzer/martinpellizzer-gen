    "intro": "Sideroxylon strigosum, commonly known as the rough-skin ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. It produces small, greenish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
