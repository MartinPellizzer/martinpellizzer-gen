    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. domokosiana, commonly known as the Hungarian whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow leaves, which contrast strikingly with its dark, fissured bark. The plant is notable for its small, aggregate fruits that mature to a reddish color, adding ornamental value in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
