    "intro": "Styphelia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters, featuring small, evergreen leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers during the spring and early summer months. Styphelia cuspidata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and coastal vegetation. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment, including salt spray and strong winds."
