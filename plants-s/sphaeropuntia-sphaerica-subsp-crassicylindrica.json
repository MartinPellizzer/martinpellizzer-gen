    "intro": "Sphaeropuntia sphaerica subsp. crassicylindrica, commonly known as the thick-stemmed barrel cactus, is a perennial cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems that are thick and ribbed, which help it store water. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils."
