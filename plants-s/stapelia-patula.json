    "intro": "Stapelia patula, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that resemble small, fleshy horns, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection from the elements. Stapelia patula is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
