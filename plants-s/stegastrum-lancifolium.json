    "intro": "Stegastrum lancifolium, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Stegastrum lancifolium produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to the ecological diversity of its wetland environment. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species."
