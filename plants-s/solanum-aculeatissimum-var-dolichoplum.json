    "intro": "Solanum aculeatissimum var. dolichoplum, commonly known as the long-fruited nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features dark green, ovate leaves with prominent veins and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
