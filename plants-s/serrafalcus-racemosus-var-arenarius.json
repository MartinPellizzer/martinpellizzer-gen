    "intro": "Serrafalcus racemosus var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a lichen species that thrives in arid and coastal environments. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a finely granular texture. It reproduces through the dispersal of ascospores, which are released from apothecia that form on the thallus surface. This variety is often found in regions with high salinity and low moisture, making it a resilient indicator of harsh environmental conditions."
