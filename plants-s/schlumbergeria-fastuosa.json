    "intro": "Schlumbergeria fastuosa, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a popular epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that are often brightly colored in shades of red, pink, and orange. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that bloom during the holiday season, typically between November and January. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schlumbergeria fastuosa is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
