    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. sartorii, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a rare and delicate fern ally native to specific regions of southern Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers shady, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its short, creeping stems. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
