    "intro": "Solanum adhaerens, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to berries containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
