    "intro": "Senecio sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf groundsels, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are generally sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk, and are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The flowers are usually yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal in dry garden settings."
