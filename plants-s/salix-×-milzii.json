    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 milzii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Salix discolor and Salix amygdaloides, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color and turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typical of willow species. Salix \u00d7 milzii is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands."
