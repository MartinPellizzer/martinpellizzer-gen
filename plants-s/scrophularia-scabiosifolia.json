It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are typically pink or purple, with five lobes and a distinctive two-lipped structure. Scrophularia scabiosifolia is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
