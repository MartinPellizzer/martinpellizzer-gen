    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. alpina, commonly known as alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its resemblance to grass species. Stellaria graminea var. alpina thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
