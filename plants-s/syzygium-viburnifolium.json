It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Syzygium viburnifolium plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
