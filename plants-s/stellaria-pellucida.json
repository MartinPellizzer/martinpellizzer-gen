    "intro": "Stellaria pellucida, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, spreading stems covered with fine, silky hairs that give it a silvery appearance. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy surface. Stellaria pellucida is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in rocky areas, and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
