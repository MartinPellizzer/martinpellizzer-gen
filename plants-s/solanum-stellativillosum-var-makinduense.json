    "intro": "Solanum stellativillosum var. makinduense, commonly known as the Makindu nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known species native to East Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
