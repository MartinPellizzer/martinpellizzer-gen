    "intro": "Scirpus coerulescens, commonly known as blue reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often bluish-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Scirpus coerulescens is adapted to tolerate standing water and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
