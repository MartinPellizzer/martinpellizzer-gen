    "intro": "Scutellaria chenopodiifolia, commonly known as sand verbena, is a herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. Scutellaria chenopodiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
