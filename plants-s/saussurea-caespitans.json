    "intro": "Saussurea caespitans, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that forms dense, compact clumps with dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments with poor soil conditions. Saussurea caespitans is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
