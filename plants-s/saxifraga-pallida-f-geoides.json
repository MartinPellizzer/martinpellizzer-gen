    "intro": "Saxifraga pallida f. geoides, commonly known as the pale saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
