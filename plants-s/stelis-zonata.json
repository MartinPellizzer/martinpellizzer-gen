    "intro": "Stelis zonata, commonly known as the zonate stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical rainforests, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing for efficient water retention. Stelis zonata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
