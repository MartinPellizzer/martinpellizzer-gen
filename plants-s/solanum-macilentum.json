    "intro": "Solanum macilentum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are typically toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is usually avoided in horticultural settings."
