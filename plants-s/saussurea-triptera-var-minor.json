    "intro": "Saussurea triptera var. minor, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that are often harvested for their medicinal properties. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to low oxygen levels at high elevations. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species in the alpine flora of Asia."
