    "intro": "Sempervivum mucronatum, commonly known as the Pointed Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive pointed tip, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Sempervivum mucronatum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in rock gardens and as a decorative succulent."
