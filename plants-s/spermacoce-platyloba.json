    "intro": "Spermacoce platyloba, commonly known as the flat-lobed sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Spermacoce platyloba is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
