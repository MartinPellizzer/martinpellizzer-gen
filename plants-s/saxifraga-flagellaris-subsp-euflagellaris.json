    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris subsp. euflagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and clustered in dense, raceme-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions, making it a resilient member of the Saxifragaceae family."
