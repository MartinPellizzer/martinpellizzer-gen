    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 mollissima var. hippophaeifolia, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. The plant has long, slender branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
