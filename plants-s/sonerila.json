    "intro": "Sonerila, commonly known as the \"blue hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their showy, often blue or violet flowers, which are typically five-petaled and resemble those of the hibiscus. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a rough or hairy texture. Sonerila species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
