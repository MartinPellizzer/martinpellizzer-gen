    "intro": "Santalum mitchellii, commonly known as the western sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant is hemi-parasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its fragrant, yellowish flowers are followed by small, round fruits containing smooth, dark brown seeds. Santalum mitchellii is valued for its aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in perfumery and woodworking."
