    "intro": "Salix fusca var. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, ascending growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family."
