    "intro": "Salix petsusu var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
