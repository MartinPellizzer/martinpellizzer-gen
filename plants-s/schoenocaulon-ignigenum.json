    "intro": "Schoenocaulon ignigenum, commonly known as the fireweed or redstem fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Schoenocaulon ignigenum is often found in disturbed areas and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal."
