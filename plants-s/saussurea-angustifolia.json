    "intro": "Saussurea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional medicine and is considered a rare and endangered species."
