    "intro": "Sagittaria lancifolia var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water, marshes, and wetlands, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arrowhead-shaped, with a prominent midrib, and produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and stabilize sediments. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and improving water quality."
