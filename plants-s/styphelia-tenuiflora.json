    "intro": "Styphelia tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically reaches heights of about 10\u201330 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Styphelia tenuiflora is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
