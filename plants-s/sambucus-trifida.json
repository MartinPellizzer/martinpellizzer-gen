    "intro": "Sambucus trifida, commonly known as the American elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Sambucus trifida is often used in traditional medicine and is a valuable plant for wildlife due to its berries and nectar-rich flowers."
