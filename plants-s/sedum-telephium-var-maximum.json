It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, ornamental plants."
