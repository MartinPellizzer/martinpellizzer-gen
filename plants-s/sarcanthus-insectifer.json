    "intro": "Sarcanthus insectifer, commonly known as the insect-carrying spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant features small, green leaves and produces clusters of yellowish flowers. Its most distinctive characteristic is the presence of specialized structures that aid in the transport of insects, possibly for pollination or defense. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent-like leaves."
