    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper to a point, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. It is a deciduous shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
