    "intro": "Salix hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as riverbanks and marshes. Salix hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
