    "intro": "Sphaeroma elegans, commonly known as the elegant moon snail, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Naticidae. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy shell that is typically white or light-colored with a faint spiral pattern. The species is found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region. Its body is soft and muscular, adapted for burrowing in sand and mud. The snail's radula, a ribbon-like structure with tiny teeth, is used for scraping food from surfaces."
