    "intro": "Scirpus leptostachyus, commonly known as slender tailed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Scirpus leptostachyus is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, contributing to wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important indicator plant for aquatic environments."
