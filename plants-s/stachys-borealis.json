    "intro": "Stachys borealis, commonly known as Arctic betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its flowering stems are often erect and can reach heights of up to 20 centimeters. Stachys borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
