It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stem and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, elliptical seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in semi-desert environments. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Sesamum genus."
