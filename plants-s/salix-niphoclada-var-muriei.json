    "intro": "Salix niphoclada var. muriei, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its small, catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in alpine gardens."
