    "intro": "Sesbania tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments and is sometimes used for soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Sesbania tetragona is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in various parts of the world."
