It features a distinctive appearance with its fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Stapelia rangeana is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
