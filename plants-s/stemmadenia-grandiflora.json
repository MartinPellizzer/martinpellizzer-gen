    "intro": "Stemmadenia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered stemmadenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, elliptical seeds. Stemmadenia grandiflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands."
