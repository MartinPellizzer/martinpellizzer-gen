    "intro": "Sibaldia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and they typically grow in temperate climates. Sibaldia species are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and inconspicuous, small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Many species of Sibaldia are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
