    "intro": "Sobreyra sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf sobreyra, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole, giving it a unique appearance. Sobreyra sessilifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at higher elevations."
