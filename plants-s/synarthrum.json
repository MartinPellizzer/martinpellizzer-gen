It is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its roots are often submerged, helping to stabilize the sediment and improve water quality. Synarthrum is also known for its ability to provide habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
