    "intro": "Salix chlorostachya, commonly known as the green-stem willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems that remain green throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, which bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Salix chlorostachya is adapted to harsh, cold environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in tundra and alpine habitats."
