    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subvar. smalliana, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh environments, including rocky soils and tundra, where it forms dense mats to retain heat and moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against cold and desiccation. This subspecies is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and characteristic member of Arctic flora."
