    "intro": "Sterculia villifera, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by large, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as the seeds are rich in protein and can be processed into flour. Additionally, the tree is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in agroforestry systems."
