    "intro": "Stelis macra, commonly known as the large-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its roots are aerial, allowing it to attach to trees or other substrates in its natural environment. Stelis macra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
