    "intro": "Senecio rangei, commonly known as the Range's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio rangei is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
