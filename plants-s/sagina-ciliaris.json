    "intro": "Sagina ciliaris, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often carpeting rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Sagina ciliaris is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
