    "intro": "Solenanthus stamineus var. luteus, commonly known as the yellow solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
