    "intro": "Stacyella crista-galli, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow or orange pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful for soil enrichment and erosion control. It typically grows in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its distinctive crown-like shape, from which it gets its common name, makes it easily recognizable in the wild."
