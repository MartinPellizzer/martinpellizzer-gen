    "intro": "Salvia microstegia, commonly known as the dwarf sage or mossy sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features compact, low-growing foliage with small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
