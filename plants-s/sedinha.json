It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Sedinha typically has a low-growing, spreading habit, often forming dense mats or clusters. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, depending on the species. It is widely used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
