It has small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an important part of the tundra ecosystem."
