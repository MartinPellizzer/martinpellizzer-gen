    "intro": "Salix cinerea f. acuta, commonly known as the acute willow, is a variant of the gray willow native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and silvery-gray bark. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture with a pale underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
