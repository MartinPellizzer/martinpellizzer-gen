    "intro": "Solanum esuriale f. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the yellow-fruited nightshade, is a variant of the Solanum esuriale species. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive yellow berries, which contrast with the typical red or purple fruits of the species. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. The yellow fruit is not only ornamental but also contains alkaloids, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
