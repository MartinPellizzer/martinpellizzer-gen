    "intro": "Schefflera scandens, commonly known as the climbing umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a whorled pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Schefflera scandens thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its lush foliage. It is also valued for its ability to climb or trail, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trained growth on trellises."
