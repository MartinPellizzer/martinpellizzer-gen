It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sisyrinchium bifolium is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
