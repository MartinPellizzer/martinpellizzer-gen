It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and fields. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Sida humillima is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to tolerate varying soil moisture conditions."
