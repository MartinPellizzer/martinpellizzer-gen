    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. This variant is notable for its adaptability to extreme climates and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
