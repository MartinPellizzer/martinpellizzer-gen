    "intro": "Sonchus micranthus, commonly known as lesser sunflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and features basal rosettes of broadly lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production, it can become invasive in some regions."
