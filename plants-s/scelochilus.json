    "intro": "Scelochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction."
