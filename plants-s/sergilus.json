    "intro": "Sergilus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Sergilus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. The plant is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
