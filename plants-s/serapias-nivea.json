    "intro": "Serapias nivea, commonly known as the snow serapias, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking white and pink flowers that resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. Serapias nivea is also notable for its ability to produce a fragrant, nectar-rich flower that attracts various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
