    "intro": "Schindleria tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tunicate orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and unique, pendulous flower spikes that bear fragrant, white flowers with a subtle violet hue. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its name derives from the velvety texture of its foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Schindleria tomentosa is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
