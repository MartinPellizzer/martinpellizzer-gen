    "intro": "Sagina spergella, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as meadows, coastal dunes, and disturbed areas. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It is an annual or short-lived perennial, with a compact growth habit that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Sagina spergella plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
