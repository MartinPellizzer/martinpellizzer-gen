    "intro": "Stichorkis brachystele, commonly known as the short-stemmed stichorkis, is a rare and distinctive member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features short, sturdy stems and compact, rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, are clustered in a spike and are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in horticultural research."
