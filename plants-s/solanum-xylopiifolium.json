It features woody stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its fruit is a globose berry that changes from green to yellow as it matures. Solanum xylopiifolium is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
