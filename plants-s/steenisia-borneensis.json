    "intro": "Steenisia borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo steenisia, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Steenisia borneensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
