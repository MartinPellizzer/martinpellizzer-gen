    "intro": "Serapias parisitica, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a unique flowering plant that exhibits parasitic behavior, deriving nutrients from its host plants. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead has specialized structures called haustoria that attach to host plants for sustenance. It is typically found in rocky or open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its specialized lifestyle and habitat requirements, Serapias parisitica is considered rare and often faces threats from habitat loss."
