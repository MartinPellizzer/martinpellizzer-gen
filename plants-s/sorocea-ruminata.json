    "intro": "Sorocea ruminata, commonly known as the woolly sorocea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
