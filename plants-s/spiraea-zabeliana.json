    "intro": "Spiraea zabeliana, commonly known as the Zabel's weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance, and its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Spiraea zabeliana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
