    "intro": "Salix bicarpa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. The tree is adapted to moist environments and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
