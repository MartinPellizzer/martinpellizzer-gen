    "intro": "Solanum rojasianum, commonly known as the Rojasian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. Its leaves are typically ovate with a rough texture, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Solanum rojasianum is often found in cloud forests and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
