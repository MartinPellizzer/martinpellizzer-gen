It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense, colorful ground covers."
