    "intro": "Soldanella minima subsp. samnitica, commonly known as the Southern Alps sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features delicate, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, white or pale pink, arranged in a cluster. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar structural and ecological traits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
