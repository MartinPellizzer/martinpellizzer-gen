    "intro": "Sarcopharyngia gentilii, commonly known as the noble thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, spiny leaves that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces showy, purple-blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are characterized by their deeply lobed structure and a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Sarcopharyngia gentilii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
