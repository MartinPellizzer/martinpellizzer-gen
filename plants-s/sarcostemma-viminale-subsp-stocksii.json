It features thin, twining stems that can reach several meters in length, often climbing over other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by follicles that contain the characteristic milky sap. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly hairy texture. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and unique growth habit."
