    "intro": "Sisyrinchium vaginatum subsp. ciliolatum, commonly known as the fringed blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its delicate, blue to violet flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) margins on the leaf sheaths, which give it its specific epithet. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences and is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates."
