    "intro": "Succisa bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed succis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with two prominent teeth on each petal, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Succisa bidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
