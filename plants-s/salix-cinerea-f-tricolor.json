    "intro": "Salix cinerea f. tricolor, commonly known as the three-color willow, is a variant of the grey willow characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves display a tri-colored pattern, typically featuring a white or silver underside, a green upper surface, and a pink or red edge. This unique coloration is due to variations in chlorophyll distribution and pigmentation. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, sandy soils near water bodies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
