    "intro": "Stellaria dulcis, commonly known as sweet stitchwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often arranged in star-like patterns, giving it its scientific name. The plant has smooth, hairy, or glandular stems and leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Stellaria dulcis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
