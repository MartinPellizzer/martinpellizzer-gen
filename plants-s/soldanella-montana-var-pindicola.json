    "intro": "Soldanella montana var. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus soldanella, is a rare alpine plant native to the Pindus Mountains in Greece. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountain meadows and alpine grasslands. It has dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces numerous small, clustered flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
