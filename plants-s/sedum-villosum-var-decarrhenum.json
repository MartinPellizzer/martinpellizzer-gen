    "intro": "Sedum villosum var. decarrhenum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
