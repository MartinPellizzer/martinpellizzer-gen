    "intro": "Styloglossum carrii, commonly known as the Carri's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green or white petals and a slender, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in humid, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often going unnoticed despite its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Styloglossum carrii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
