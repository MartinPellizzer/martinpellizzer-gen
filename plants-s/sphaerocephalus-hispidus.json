    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus hispidus, commonly known as the woolly globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical, hairy inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals that are slightly curled at the edges. Sphaerocephalus hispidus is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in rocky or alpine environments."
