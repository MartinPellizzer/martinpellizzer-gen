    "intro": "Salvia verbenaca subsp. clandestina, commonly known as the secret sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. Its common name reflects its somewhat elusive nature, as it is not widely cultivated or well-known compared to other salvias."
