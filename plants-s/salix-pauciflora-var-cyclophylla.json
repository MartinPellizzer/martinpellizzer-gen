    "intro": "Salix pauciflora var. cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla willow, is a variant of the pauciflora willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. This species is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
