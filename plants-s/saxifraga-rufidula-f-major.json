    "intro": "Saxifraga rufidula f. major, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Due to its cold-hardy nature, it is a symbol of resilience in harsh climates."
