    "intro": "Scilla glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are relatively small and are often used in rock gardens or as ornamental plants. Scilla glandulosa is known for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
