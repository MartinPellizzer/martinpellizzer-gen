    "intro": "Selaginella herteri, commonly known as the Herter's spikemoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in strobila, which are cone-like structures. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Selaginella herteri exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme conditions through a process called cryptobiosis, where it can enter a dormant state. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats."
