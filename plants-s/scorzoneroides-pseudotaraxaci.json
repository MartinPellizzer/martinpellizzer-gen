    "intro": "Scorzoneroides pseudotaraxaci, commonly known as the false stonecrop, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Crassulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Scorzoneroides pseudotaraxaci is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
