    "intro": "Syzygium bernardoi, commonly known as the Bernard's tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or reddish when mature. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a sour taste, making it a valued resource in local cuisine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syzygium bernardoi is considered a rare and endangered species."
