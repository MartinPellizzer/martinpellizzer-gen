    "intro": "Stenogyne elliptilobata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip, and are often covered in fine hairs. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
