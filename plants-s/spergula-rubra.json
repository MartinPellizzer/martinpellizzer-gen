    "intro": "Spergula rubra, commonly known as red sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or red. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Spergula rubra is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, where it is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes and rocky slopes."
