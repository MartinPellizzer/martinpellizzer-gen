    "intro": "Solidago lepida var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax golden tickseed, is a variant of the golden tickseed species native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer to early autumn. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in wetland environments where it thrives in the presence of consistent moisture."
