    "intro": "Strobilanthes remota, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, orchid-like appearance with delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific flies for reproduction. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or roots. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
