    "intro": "Sisymbrium propinquum, commonly known as the common tansy, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring erect stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom from late spring to early autumn. The seeds are enclosed in a pod-like structure called a silique, which splits open when mature to disperse the seeds."
