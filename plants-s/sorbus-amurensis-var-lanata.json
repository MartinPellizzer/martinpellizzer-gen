    "intro": "Sorbus amurensis var. lanata, commonly known as the Amur whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly-haired foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape and have a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
