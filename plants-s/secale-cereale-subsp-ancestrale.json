    "intro": "Secale cereale subsp. ancestrale, commonly known as wild rye, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets along the upper portion. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This subspecies is considered a wild relative of cultivated rye and has ecological and potential agricultural significance."
