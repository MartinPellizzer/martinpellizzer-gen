    "intro": "Scabiosa plumosa, commonly known as the plume scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fluffy, feathery flower heads that resemble plumes, which are composed of numerous small, pink or white petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa plumosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
