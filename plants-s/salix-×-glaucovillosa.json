    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 glaucovillosa, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives near water bodies such as rivers and streams. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
