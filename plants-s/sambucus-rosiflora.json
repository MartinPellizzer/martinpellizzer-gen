    "intro": "Sambucus rosiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that resemble roses, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by dark purple berries that ripen in the fall. Sambucus rosiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
