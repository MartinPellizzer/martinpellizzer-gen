    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. dasyvaginata, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves with a hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are typically pale green to golden in color. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to tolerate drought conditions, making it resilient in harsh environments. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
