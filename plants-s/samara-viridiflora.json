    "intro": "Samara viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered samara, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant produces small, winged fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Samara viridiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
