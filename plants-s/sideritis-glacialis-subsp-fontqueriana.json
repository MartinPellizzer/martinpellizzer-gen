    "intro": "Sideritis glacialis subsp. fontqueriana, commonly known as the alpine sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountainous areas. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
