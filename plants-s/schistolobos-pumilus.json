    "intro": "Schistolobos pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf schistolobos, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in the axils of the leaves, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil. Schistolobos pumilus is often found in shaded, understory environments where it thrives in high humidity and partial light."
