    "intro": "Serrafalcus macrostachys var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf serrafalcus, is a rare and compact variety of the serrafalcus genus. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, clustered inflorescences that bloom with tiny, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight to flourish. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections."
