    "intro": "Sideroxylon saxorum, commonly known as the rock ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, woody stems that are resistant to drought and damage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its thick, leathery leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Sideroxylon saxorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
