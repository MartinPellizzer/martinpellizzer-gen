    "intro": "Salix rubricapsula, commonly known as the red-capped willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its flowers are distinctive for their red-brown capsules, which give the species its common name. Salix rubricapsula is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
