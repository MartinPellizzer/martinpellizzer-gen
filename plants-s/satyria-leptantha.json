    "intro": "Satyria leptantha, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a member of the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Satyria leptantha thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and dunes."
