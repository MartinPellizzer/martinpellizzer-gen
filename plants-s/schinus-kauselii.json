    "intro": "Schinus kauselii, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Brazil. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The tree is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and pinnately compound leaves that are alternate on the stems. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by red, fleshy drupes that contain a single seed. Schinus kauselii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
