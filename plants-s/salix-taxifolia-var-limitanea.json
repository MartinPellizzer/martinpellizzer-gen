    "intro": "Salix taxifolia var. limitanea, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
