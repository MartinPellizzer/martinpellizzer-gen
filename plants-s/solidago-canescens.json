    "intro": "Solidago canescens, commonly known as gray goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Solidago canescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its flowering period."
