    "intro": "Stachys bornmuelleri, commonly known as the silver velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Stachys bornmuelleri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
