    "intro": "Sceptridium biternatum, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate fronds that give it a unique, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
