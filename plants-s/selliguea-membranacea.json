    "intro": "Selliguea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous rock liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, flat, and often lobed leaves that are covered in a thin, membranous cuticle. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its structure includes a thalloid body with distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces. Selliguea membranacea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
