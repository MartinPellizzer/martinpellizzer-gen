    "intro": "Stenogyne albimontis, commonly known as the white mountain stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. This species is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal habitats, often on lava flows or in areas with poor soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
