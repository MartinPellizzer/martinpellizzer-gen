    "intro": "Scutellaria indica f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved skullcap, is a compact perennial herb native to the Himalayas. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, giving it its distinguishing name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
