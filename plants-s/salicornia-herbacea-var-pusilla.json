    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, where it tolerates high concentrations of salt. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes cultivated for use in food and agriculture."
