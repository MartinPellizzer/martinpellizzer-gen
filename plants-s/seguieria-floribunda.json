    "intro": "Seguieria floribunda, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Seguieria floribunda is often found in coastal dunes and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes."
