    "intro": "Spartium erinaceoides, commonly known as bristly sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. Spartium erinaceoides is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
