    "intro": "Scabiosa calcarea, commonly known as the limestone scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Scabiosa calcarea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
