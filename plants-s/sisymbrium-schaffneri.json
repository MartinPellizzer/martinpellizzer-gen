    "intro": "Sisymbrium schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's broomrape, is an annual parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to attach to the roots of its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
