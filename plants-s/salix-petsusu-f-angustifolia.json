    "intro": "Salix petsusu f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks, meadows, and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
