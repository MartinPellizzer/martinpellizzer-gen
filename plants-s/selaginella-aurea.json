    "intro": "Selaginella aurea, commonly known as the golden spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct midrib, and the plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation. Selaginella aurea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
