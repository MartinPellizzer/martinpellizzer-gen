    "intro": "Santolina pallida, commonly known as silver santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Santolina pallida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties and ornamental value make it a valued plant in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
