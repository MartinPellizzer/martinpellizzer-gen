    "intro": "Silene humilis, commonly known as the low saxifrage, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant produces delicate pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Silene humilis is often found in open habitats such as meadows, cliffs, and slopes, and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
