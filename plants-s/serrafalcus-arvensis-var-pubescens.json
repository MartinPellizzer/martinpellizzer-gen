It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in short, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile spore-bearing structures appearing on the upper surfaces. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
