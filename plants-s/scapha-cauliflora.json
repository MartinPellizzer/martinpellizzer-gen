    "intro": "Scapha cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen. The plant produces its flowers and fruits on the main stem rather than the tips of the branches, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Scapha cauliflora is well adapted to saline and coastal conditions, making it a common sight in mangrove swamps and salt marshes."
