It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically green with red or purple markings, giving it a striking appearance. Bloodstone is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
