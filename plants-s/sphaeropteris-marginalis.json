    "intro": "Sphaeropteris marginalis, commonly known as the marginate cycad, is a distinctive cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often adorned with a waxy, blue-green hue. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with the male cones typically appearing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging higher up. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
