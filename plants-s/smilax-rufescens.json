    "intro": "Smilax rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often reddish in color, and its compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose panicles, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some wildlife. Smilax rufescens is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience in both shaded and sunny environments. It is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along the edges of forests."
