    "intro": "Schoenoplectus \u00d7 carinatus nothosubsp. triquetriformis, commonly known as the triangular beak sedge, is a hybrid plant species within the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. This nothosubspecies is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its morphology reflects a blend of traits from its parent species, making it a notable example of hybridization in the genus Schoenoplectus."
