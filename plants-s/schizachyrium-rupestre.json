    "intro": "Schizachyrium rupestre, commonly known as eastern grassland panicum, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its fine texture and ability to form dense clumps make it an attractive addition to native gardens. Schizachyrium rupestre also plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in grassland habitats."
