    "intro": "Swida \u00d7 acadiensis, commonly known as the Nova Scotia willow, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Swida canadensis and Swida triacanthos. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender branches and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, typically in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Swida \u00d7 acadiensis is native to the eastern coast of North America and is adapted to moist, acidic soils."
