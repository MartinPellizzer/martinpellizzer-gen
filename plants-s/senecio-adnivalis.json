    "intro": "Senecio adnivalis, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous environments. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Senecio adnivalis plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
