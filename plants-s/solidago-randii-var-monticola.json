    "intro": "Solidago randii var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native environment."
