    "intro": "Struthanthus gardnerianus, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in dry climates."
