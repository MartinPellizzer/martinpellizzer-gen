    "intro": "Salicornia robusta, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, scale-like leaves. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Salicornia robusta is an important plant for stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
