    "intro": "Stachys distans, commonly known as the wandering jew, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Stachys distans is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners, though it can become invasive if not controlled."
