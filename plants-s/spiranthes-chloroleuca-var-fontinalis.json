    "intro": "Spiranthes chloroleuca var. fontinalis, commonly known as the small white fringed orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral arrangement of white to pale yellow flowers with fringed petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like and basal, forming a rosette that supports the flowering stems. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more subdued coloration compared to other Spiranthes species."
