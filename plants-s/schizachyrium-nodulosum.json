    "intro": "Schizachyrium nodulosum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry to moist prairie habitats and is characterized by its blue-green foliage and distinctive seed heads. The plant has a clump-forming habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that turn reddish-brown in maturity. Its roots form dense networks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schizachyrium nodulosum is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
