    "intro": "Siderobombyx kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu flat bark beetle, is a species of beetle endemic to the mountainous regions of Borneo, particularly Mount Kinabalu. It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and metallic green coloration, which provides it with effective camouflage in its natural habitat. The beetle's life cycle involves a unique relationship with the host plant, where larvae develop within the stems of specific fern species. Its distribution is restricted to high-altitude ecosystems, making it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Siderobombyx kinabaluensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
