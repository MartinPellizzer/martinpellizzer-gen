    "intro": "Smilax subaculeata, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and sharp, spiny leaves that are typically alternate and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Smilax subaculeata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its aggressive growth habit. Its botanical features make it both a persistent weed and a subject of ecological study."
