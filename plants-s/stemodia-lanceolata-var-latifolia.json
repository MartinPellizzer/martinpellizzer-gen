    "intro": "Stemodia lanceolata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf stemodia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and tapering, with a broad base in this variant. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas."
