It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevations. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
