    "intro": "Sarcopodium parvulum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are small and often submerged, while its flowers are inconspicuous and borne on slender stems. Sarcopodium parvulum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
