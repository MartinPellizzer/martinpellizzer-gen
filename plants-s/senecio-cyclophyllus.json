    "intro": "Senecio cyclophyllus, commonly known as the cyclophyllus groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
