    "intro": "Solidago discoidea, commonly known as the disk goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its distinctive yellow flowers arranged in a disk-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Solidago discoidea is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
