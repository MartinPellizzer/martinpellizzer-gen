    "intro": "Stylosanthes riparia, commonly known as the river stylo, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is often used in forage production and soil stabilization due to its hardiness. Stylosanthes riparia is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
