It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or heathy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and densely packed, providing a dense cover. Styphelia geissoloma is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
