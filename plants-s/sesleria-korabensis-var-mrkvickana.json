    "intro": "Sesleria korabensis var. mrkvickana, commonly known as the Korab sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
