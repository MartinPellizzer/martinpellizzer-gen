    "intro": "Sorbus diabolica, commonly known as the devil\u2019s ivy, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its common name reflects its striking appearance and the caution it inspires due to its poisonous properties. Sorbus diabolica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
