    "intro": "Scyphostelma ruizteranii, commonly known as the Ruizteran's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its foliage consists of small, elliptical leaves with a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Scyphostelma ruizteranii is considered a vulnerable species."
