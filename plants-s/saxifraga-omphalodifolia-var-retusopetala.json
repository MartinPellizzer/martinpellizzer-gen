    "intro": "Saxifraga omphalodifolia var. retusopetala, commonly known as the round-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features rosettes of broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in a terminal inflorescence. Its leaves are characterized by their rounded tips, which distinguish it from other varieties of Saxifraga omphalodifolia. This species is noted for its resilience to harsh mountain conditions and its ornamental value in alpine gardens."
