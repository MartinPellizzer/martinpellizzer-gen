It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the top of the stem. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies in muddy or wet soils. Scirpus chen-moui plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
