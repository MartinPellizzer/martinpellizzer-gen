    "intro": "Solanum sanfurgoi, commonly known as the San Francisco nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color. Its fruit is a yellowish berry that ripens in the fall, and it contains toxic compounds similar to other members of the Solanaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
