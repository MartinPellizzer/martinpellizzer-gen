    "intro": "Stizolobium microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded legume, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters. The plant bears pods that contain tiny, hard seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions. Stizolobium microspermum has some use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
