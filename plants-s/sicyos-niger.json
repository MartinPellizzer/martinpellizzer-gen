    "intro": "Sicyos niger, commonly known as the black rat-tail gourd, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive black, spiny fruits that resemble a rat's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers and has heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. It thrives in warm climates and is often grown for its ornamental value or as a source of traditional medicine. The fruit is edible when young but becomes bitter and inedible as it matures."
