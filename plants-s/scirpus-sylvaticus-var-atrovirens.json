    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. atrovirens, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, dark green to blackish stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist soils. Scirpus sylvaticus var. atrovirens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wetland organisms."
