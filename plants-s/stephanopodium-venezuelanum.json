    "intro": "Stephanopodium venezuelanum, commonly known as the Venezuelan stephanopodium, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a dense cluster, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
