It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its strong, minty fragrance. This subspecies is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antimicrobial properties."
