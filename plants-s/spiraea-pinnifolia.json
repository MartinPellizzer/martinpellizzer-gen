    "intro": "Spiraea pinnifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Spiraea pinnifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
