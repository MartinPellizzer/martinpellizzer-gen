It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes, lakes, and riverbanks. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it important for wetland ecosystems. Scirpus turkestanicus is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
