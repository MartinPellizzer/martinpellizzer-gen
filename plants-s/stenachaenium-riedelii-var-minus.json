    "intro": "Stenachaenium riedelii var. minus, commonly known as the lesser rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces delicate white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer, which are clustered in tight, compact inflorescences. Its flowering stems are generally shorter than those of the typical variety, contributing to its distinguishing characteristics. This species is often found in rocky crevices and dry slopes, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils."
