It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically arranged in clusters, and it produces distinctive, inflated seed pods. This variant is notable for its adaptation to dry, rocky habitats and its role in local ecosystems."
