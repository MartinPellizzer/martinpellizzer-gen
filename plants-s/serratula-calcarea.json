It is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its scientific name reflects its preference for calcium-rich environments. Serratula calcarea is typically herbaceous and can be found in open fields and along roadsides."
