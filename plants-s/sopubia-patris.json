    "intro": "Sopubia patris, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and red, bloom in late spring to early summer. Sopubia patris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small desert animals."
