    "intro": "Spatularia stellaris, commonly known as the starry spatula lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like thallus structure with a central, flat, spatula-shaped body. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil, and its color ranges from pale yellow to orange-brown. It is often found in temperate regions and is a common indicator species for humid, forested habitats. Spatularia stellaris plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
