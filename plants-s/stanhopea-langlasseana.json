    "intro": "Stanhopea langlasseana, commonly known as the Langlasse's stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Stanhopea langlasseana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique and striking floral display."
