    "intro": "Sedum dasyphyllum var. mesatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic sedum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a slightly waxy texture. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
