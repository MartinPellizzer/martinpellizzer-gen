    "intro": "Spiraea hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Spiraea hendersonii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
