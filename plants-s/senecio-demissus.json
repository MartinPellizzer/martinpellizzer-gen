    "intro": "Senecio demissus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white to grayish hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
