    "intro": "Stachys annua var. ammophila, commonly known as beach hedge nettle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its tolerance for salt and wind. This variant is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for coastal landscaping."
