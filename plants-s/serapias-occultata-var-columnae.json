    "intro": "Serapias occultata var. columnae, commonly known as the columned serapias, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Capparaceae), characterized by its small, delicate flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, are arranged in clusters and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
