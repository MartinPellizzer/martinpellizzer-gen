    "intro": "Spiraea crenifolia f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with finely toothed margins, and the plant is noted for its smooth, glabrous texture, which distinguishes it from other forms of Spiraea crenifolia. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
