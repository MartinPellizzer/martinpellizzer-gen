    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 stenopetalum, commonly known as the stonecrop hybrid, is a succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover."
