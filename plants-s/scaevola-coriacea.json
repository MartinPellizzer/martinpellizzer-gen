    "intro": "Scaevola coriacea, commonly known as the coastal scabious, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically blue-gray and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune and coastal grassland habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
