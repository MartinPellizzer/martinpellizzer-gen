    "intro": "Selenipedium reichenbachii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pendulous inflorescence, which can reach several feet in length. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for photosynthesis, making it a hemiparasitic species. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a complex structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Selenipedium reichenbachii is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
