    "intro": "Sauropus glaucus var. glaber, commonly known as the rough-leaved sauropus, is a variant of the sauropus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery, and often rough-textured leaves that are typically a bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas in the wild. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in garden settings."
