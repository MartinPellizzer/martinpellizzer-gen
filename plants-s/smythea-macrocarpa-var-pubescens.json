    "intro": "Smythea macrocarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent macrocarpa, is a rare and distinctive species within the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with pink to red flowers, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
