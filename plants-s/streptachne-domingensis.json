It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and inflorescences that are typically spike-like. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, a basal rosette of leaves, and small, wind-pollinated flowers. Streptachne domingensis is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential for use in restoration projects."
