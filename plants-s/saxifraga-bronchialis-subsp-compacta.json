    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis subsp. compacta, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, cushion-like clusters of foliage, adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are usually rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
