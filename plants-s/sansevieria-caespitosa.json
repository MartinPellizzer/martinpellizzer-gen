It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with light green or yellow margins. The plant produces small, white flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in low-light conditions, making it an ideal houseplant. Its ability to purify indoor air and its low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity."
