    "intro": "Symphyotrichum peteroanum, commonly known as the Peter's New England aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are arranged in dense, conical clusters. Symphyotrichum peteroanum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
