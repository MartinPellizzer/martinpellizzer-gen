It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in open habitats along the shores of the Cook Strait. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
