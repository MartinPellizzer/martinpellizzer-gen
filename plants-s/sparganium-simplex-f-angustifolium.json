    "intro": "Sparganium simplex f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a variant of the bur-reed plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces spiky, cylindrical inflorescences that are often covered in short, bristly hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. This form is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, thriving in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
