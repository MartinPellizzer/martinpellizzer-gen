    "intro": "Seguieria floribunda f. alutacea, commonly known as the alutacea form of the flowering seguieria, is a compact, low-growing plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils. This form is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
