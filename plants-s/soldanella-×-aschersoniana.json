    "intro": "Soldanella \u00d7 aschersoniana, commonly known as the hybrid snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the genus Soldanella, which is part of the family Primulaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and woodland areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in the wild."
