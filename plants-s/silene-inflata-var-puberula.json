    "intro": "Silene inflata var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like pods that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and grasslands. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
