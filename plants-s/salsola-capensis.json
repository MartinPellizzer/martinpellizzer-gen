It is an annual or biennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish and appear in clusters. Salsola capensis is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
