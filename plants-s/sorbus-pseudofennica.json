    "intro": "Sorbus pseudofennica, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Sorbus genus."
