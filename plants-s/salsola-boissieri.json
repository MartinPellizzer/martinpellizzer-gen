    "intro": "Salsola boissieri, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with dense, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Salsola boissieri is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
