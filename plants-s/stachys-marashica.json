    "intro": "Stachys marashica, commonly known as Armenian betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming and antispasmodic properties. Stachys marashica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
