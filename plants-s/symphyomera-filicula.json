It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching sporophyte structure. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Symphyomera filicula reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate and tropical ecosystems."
