    "intro": "Soulangia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved soulangia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible parts. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, aromatic leaves that resemble those of thyme, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Soulangia thymifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
