    "intro": "Spirolobium, commonly known as the spirobrolium or the spiral flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plants typically have compound leaves with a feathery appearance, and their flowers are small and clustered. Spirolobium species are native to North America and are often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
