    "intro": "Schizaea spirophylla, commonly known as the spiral moss, is a type of fern that belongs to the family Schizaeaceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of its fronds, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Schizaea spirophylla has a simple structure with no true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
