    "intro": "Sarcochilus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, fleshy labellum. It thrives in rocky or shaded habitats and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
