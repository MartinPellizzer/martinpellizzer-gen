    "intro": "Selaginella agioneuma, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Selaginella agioneuma reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
