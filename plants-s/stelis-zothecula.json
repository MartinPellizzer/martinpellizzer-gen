    "intro": "Stelis zothecula, commonly known as the orchid with clustered pseudobulbs, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the wet season. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Stelis zothecula is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
