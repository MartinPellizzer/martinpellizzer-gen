    "intro": "Sphaeralcea circinata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, woolly stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea circinata is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
