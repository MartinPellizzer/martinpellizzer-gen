    "intro": "Stellilabium ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian star-labium, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically a blend of white and purple hues. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, delicate roots that help it anchor in the moist, shaded environments it inhabits. It thrives in high-altitude regions with high humidity and is often found growing on tree trunks or among moss-covered rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
