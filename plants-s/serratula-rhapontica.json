It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Serratula rhapontica is sometimes considered a weed but has historical use in traditional medicine."
