    "intro": "Stylodon, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually broad and arrow-shaped, floating on the water surface or submerged. Stylodon species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
