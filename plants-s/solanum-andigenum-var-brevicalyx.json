    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to purple in color. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing numerous seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its potential toxicity, it is often avoided for consumption but has been studied for its medicinal properties."
