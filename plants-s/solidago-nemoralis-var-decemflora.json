It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and meadows, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched.
