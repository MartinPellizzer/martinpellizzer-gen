    "intro": "Strychnos duckei, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and smooth, often glossy leaves. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which are responsible for its name and its dangerous effects on humans and animals. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
