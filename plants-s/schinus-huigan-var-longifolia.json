    "intro": "Schinus huigan var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf huira or longleaf poisonwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically elongated and have a leathery texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both livestock and humans."
