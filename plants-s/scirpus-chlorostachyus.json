    "intro": "Scirpus chlorostachyus, commonly known as the green-stem bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are usually green or bluish-green in color, which distinguishes it from other bulrush species. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus chlorostachyus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
