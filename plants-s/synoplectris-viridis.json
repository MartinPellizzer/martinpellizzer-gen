    "intro": "Synoplectris viridis, commonly known as the green tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a compact cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Synoplectris viridis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
