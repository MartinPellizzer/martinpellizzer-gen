    "intro": "Steiractinia cupulifera, commonly known as the cup-shaped star moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. It is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with a cup-like structure that helps retain moisture. Its small, scale-like leaves are typically green or reddish in color, and it lacks true stems. Steiractinia cupulifera is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to survive in humid, shaded microhabitats."
