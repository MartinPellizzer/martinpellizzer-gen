    "intro": "Sagina glabra var. corsica, commonly known as Corsican mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
