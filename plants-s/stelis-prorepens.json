    "intro": "Stelis prorepens, commonly known as the climbing stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a short, creeping stem that allows it to climb and attach to tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with three petals and a spurred lip. Stelis prorepens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
