    "intro": "Stelis cyclopetala, commonly known as the cyclops orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with tightly packed, dark green leaves. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth."
