It features soft, velvety silver-gray leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to violet flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
