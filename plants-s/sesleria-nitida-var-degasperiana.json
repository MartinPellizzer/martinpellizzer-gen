    "intro": "Sesleria nitida var. degasperiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, grass-like blades that are typically green, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats in shaded environments."
