    "intro": "Steiractinia longipes, commonly known as the long-footed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, hairy rhizomes and striking, often violet or purple-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology includes long, slender leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
