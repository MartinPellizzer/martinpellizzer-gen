    "intro": "Senecio auricula, commonly known as the auriculate groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and distinctive, auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
