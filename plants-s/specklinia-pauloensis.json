    "intro": "Specklinia pauloensis, commonly known as the Paulo's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
