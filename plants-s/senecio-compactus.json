    "intro": "Senecio compactus, commonly known as the compact blueweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray hue that helps it retain moisture. Senecio compactus is often used in rock gardens due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
