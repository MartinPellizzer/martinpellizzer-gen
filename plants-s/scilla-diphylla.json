    "intro": "Scilla diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features grass-like, basal leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant is typically found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive harsh winters. Scilla diphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
