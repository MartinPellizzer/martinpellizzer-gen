    "intro": "Styphelia insularis, commonly known as the island heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Styphelia insularis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
