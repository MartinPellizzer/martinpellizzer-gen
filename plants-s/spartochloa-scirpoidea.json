    "intro": "Spartochloa scirpoidea, commonly known as the marsh arrowgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Spartochloa scirpoidea plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity."
