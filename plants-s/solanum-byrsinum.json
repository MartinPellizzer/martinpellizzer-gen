    "intro": "Solanum byrsinum, commonly known as the velvet leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a deep red, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires caution when handling."
