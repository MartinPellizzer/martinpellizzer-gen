    "intro": "Selliguea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like structure that is often divided into lobes. Its small, spirally arranged leaves are characterized by their narrow, elongated shape. Selliguea stenophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
