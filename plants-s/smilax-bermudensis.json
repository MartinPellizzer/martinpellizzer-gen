    "intro": "Smilax bermudensis, commonly known as Bermuda arrowroot, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
