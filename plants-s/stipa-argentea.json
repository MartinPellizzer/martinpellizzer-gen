It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight silver sheen that enhances its ornamental value. Stipa argentea is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
