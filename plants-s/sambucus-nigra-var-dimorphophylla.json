    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. dimorphophylla, commonly known as the European elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and often have a distinct two-lobed base, giving it the species name *dimorphophylla*. The plant produces clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared properly before consumption. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
