    "intro": "Sagina saginoides var. nivalis, commonly known as snow saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, tightly packed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. This variety is often found in mountainous regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America."
