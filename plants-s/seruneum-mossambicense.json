    "intro": "Seruneum mossambicense, commonly known as the Mozambique seruneum, is a rare and unique moss species native to the coastal regions of Mozambique. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. The plant has a delicate, creeping growth habit with small, ovate leaves that are covered in a thin layer of translucent cuticle. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are relatively simple and consist of a slender stem with a single capsule. Seruneum mossambicense plays a vital ecological role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its native habitat."
