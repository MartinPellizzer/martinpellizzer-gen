    "intro": "Sambucus adnata, commonly known as the Indian elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a whorled pattern, and its clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from red to black, which are typically edible but should be consumed with caution due to potential toxicity. Sambucus adnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine. Its growth habit and adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitats."
