    "intro": "Schnella sprucei, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a compact, rounded form with dense, dark green foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are short and stiff, arranged in whorls around the stems. Its cones are small and usually shed their seeds naturally, contributing to its limited spread. Schnella sprucei is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils."
