    "intro": "Scyphaea, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are filled with water and can snap shut to trap tiny aquatic organisms. Scyphaea species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They are carnivorous, supplementing their nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey. The plant's morphology includes slender stems and leaves that often float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis and buoyancy."
