    "intro": "Strychnos suberifera, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated pods containing small, hard seeds. It is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses. However, like many members of its genus, it contains toxic compounds and requires caution in handling."
