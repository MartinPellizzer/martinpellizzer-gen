    "intro": "Solanum guamense, commonly known as the Guam nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mariana Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, and its berries are usually red when mature. Solanum guamense belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. It plays a role in the local ecosystem and has been the subject of botanical studies due to its unique characteristics and limited distribution."
