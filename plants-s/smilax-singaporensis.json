    "intro": "Smilax singaporensis, commonly known as the Singapore arrowroot, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its stout, woody stems and spiny nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spadices, followed by berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped, hence the common name, and are often used in traditional medicine. Smilax singaporensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
