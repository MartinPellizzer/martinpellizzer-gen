    "intro": "Sarcochilus segawae, commonly known as the Segawa's sarcochilus, is a rare and unusual orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces a single, striking flower per inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
