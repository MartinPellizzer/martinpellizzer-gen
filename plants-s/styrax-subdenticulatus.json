    "intro": "Styrax subdenticulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
