    "intro": "Schizoglossum huttoniae, commonly known as the Hutton's schizoglossum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and possesses small, elongated leaves with a distinct waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Schizoglossum huttoniae is adapted to cold, rocky environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
