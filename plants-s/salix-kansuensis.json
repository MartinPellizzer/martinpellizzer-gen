    "intro": "Salix kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It is well adapted to dry environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Salix kansuensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
