    "intro": "Sedum antiquum, commonly known as old sedum, is a perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum antiquum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
