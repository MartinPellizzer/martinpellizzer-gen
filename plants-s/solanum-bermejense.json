    "intro": "Solanum bermejense, commonly known as the Bermejense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and small, white or pale purple flowers. Its berries are usually yellow or orange when ripe and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
