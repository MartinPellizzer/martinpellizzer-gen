It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
