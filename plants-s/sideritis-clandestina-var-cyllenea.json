    "intro": "Sideritis clandestina var. cyllenea, commonly known as the Greek violet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
