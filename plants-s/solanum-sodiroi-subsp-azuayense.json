    "intro": "Solanum sodiroi subsp. azuayense, commonly known as the Azuay nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at moderate altitudes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential medicinal properties."
