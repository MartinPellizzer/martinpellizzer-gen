    "intro": "Salix atropurpurea, commonly known as purple osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems that turn a striking reddish-purple color in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are followed by white to pinkish flowers. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and a bluish-green upper surface. Salix atropurpurea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
