    "intro": "Schizachyrium niveum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is characterized by its blue-green color during the growing season and turns coppery in the fall. This perennial plant is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites, contributing to soil stabilization. Its slender, tufted growth habit and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of native grasslands. Schizachyrium niveum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as providing habitat for wildlife."
