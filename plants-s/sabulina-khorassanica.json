    "intro": "Sabulina khorassanica, commonly known as the Afghan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or steppe habitats. Due to its adaptability, Sabulina khorassanica is considered a hardy species suitable for xerophytic gardens."
