    "intro": "Senecio phalacrocarpus, commonly known as the coastal senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in coastal environments, characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky areas. Its growth habit is compact, with upright stems that produce clusters of small, daisy-like blooms. Senecio phalacrocarpus is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
