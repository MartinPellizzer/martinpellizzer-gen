    "intro": "Syzygium claviflorum subsp. tavaiense, commonly known as the Tavai rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the humid lowland forests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, reddish-brown fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It is valued for its hard, heavy timber, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture making. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
