    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 melzeri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Saxifraga \u00d7 melzeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga myrtilloides."
