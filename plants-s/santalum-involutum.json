    "intro": "Santalum involutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its aromatic wood has been historically valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important species in certain ecosystems."
