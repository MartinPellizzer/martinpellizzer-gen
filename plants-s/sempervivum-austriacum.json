    "intro": "Sempervivum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Alps. It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, leafless stalks. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Sempervivum austriacum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
