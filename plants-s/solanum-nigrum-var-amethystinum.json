    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. amethystinum, commonly known as the purple black nightshade, is a variant of the common black nightshade, characterized by its striking purple-black berries. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its berries, which are edible when ripe, contain alkaloids and should be consumed with caution. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant fruit color and historical use in traditional medicine."
