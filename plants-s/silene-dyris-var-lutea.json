It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
