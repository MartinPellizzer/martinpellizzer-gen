    "intro": "Spermacoce parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flower bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Spermacoce parvifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
