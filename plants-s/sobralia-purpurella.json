    "intro": "Sobralia purpurella, commonly known as the purple sobralia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, attaching itself to trees without being parasitic. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating. The flowers are borne on elongated inflorescences and are known for their fragrant, nectar-rich blooms that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
