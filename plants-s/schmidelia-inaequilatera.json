    "intro": "Schmidelia inaequilatera, commonly known as the unequal-sided schmidelia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
