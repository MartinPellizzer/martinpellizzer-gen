    "intro": "Spiroloba, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids for anchoring and absorbing nutrients. Spiroloba reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporophytes. It is often found in damp environments such as soil, rocks, or decaying wood."
