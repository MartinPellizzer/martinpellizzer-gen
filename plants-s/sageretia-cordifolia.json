    "intro": "Sageretia cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf sageretia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Its fibrous roots and nitrogen-fixing abilities make it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
