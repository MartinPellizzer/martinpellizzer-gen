    "intro": "Sapium cupuliferum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by orange-yellow fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth rate. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
