    "intro": "Sterculia yatesii, commonly known as the Yates' sterculia, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers. The plant has distinctive, palmate leaves and produces woody pods that contain small, hard seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
