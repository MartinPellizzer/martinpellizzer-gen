    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum subsp. polyedrum, commonly known as the branched bur reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its distinctive, spiky, cylindrical inflorescences. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, muddy soils and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
