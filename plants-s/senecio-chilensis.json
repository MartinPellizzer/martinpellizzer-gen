    "intro": "Senecio chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, fleshy leaves. Its yellow disc flowers are surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, making it visually distinct. Senecio chilensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
