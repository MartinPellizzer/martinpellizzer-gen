    "intro": "Shivparvatia forrestii, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Shivparvatia forrestii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
