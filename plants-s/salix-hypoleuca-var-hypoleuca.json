    "intro": "Salix hypoleuca var. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and long, narrow leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in wetlands. Its presence is often indicative of riparian ecosystems and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks."
