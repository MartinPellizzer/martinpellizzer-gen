    "intro": "Stellaria petiolaris, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
