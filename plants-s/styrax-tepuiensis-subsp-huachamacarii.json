    "intro": "Styrax tepuiensis subsp. huachamacarii, commonly known as the Huachamacarii styrax, is a rare and endemic species native to the tepuis of northern South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, typical of the Styracaceae family. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
