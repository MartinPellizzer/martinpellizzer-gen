    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. coraila, commonly known as the coral-colored potato, is a horticultural form of the common potato characterized by its striking, variegated foliage. This variety exhibits a unique combination of green, white, and pink hues on its leaves, creating a visually appealing appearance. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, producing tubers that are smaller than standard potatoes. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal rather than for culinary use."
