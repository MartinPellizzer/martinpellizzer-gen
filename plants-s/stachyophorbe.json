    "intro": "Stachyophorbe, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically have five petals with a distinctive yellowish or white coloration. Stachyophorbe species are known for their milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. They are often found in grassland and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
