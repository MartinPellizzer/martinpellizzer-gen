    "intro": "Serratula nemorum, commonly known as common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds."
