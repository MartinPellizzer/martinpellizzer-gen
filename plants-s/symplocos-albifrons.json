    "intro": "Symplocos albifrons, commonly known as the white-fruited evergreen holly, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Symplocos albifrons thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
