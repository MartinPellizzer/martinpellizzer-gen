    "intro": "Satyrium zombense, commonly known as the zombie orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the dense, humid rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns resembling skeletal structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils through specialized mycorrhizal associations. Its unique floral morphology is believed to play a role in attracting specific pollinators, though its reproductive biology remains poorly understood. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Satyrium zombense is considered critically endangered."
