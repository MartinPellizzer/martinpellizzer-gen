    "intro": "Saxifraga filamentosa, commonly known as the threadleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga filamentosa is often found in mountain meadows and is a hardy species that can withstand harsh weather conditions."
