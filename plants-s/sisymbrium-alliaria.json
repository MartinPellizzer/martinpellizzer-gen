    "intro": "Sisymbrium alliaria, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, aromatic leaves that emit a garlic-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are contained in slender, pod-like fruits that dehisce to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sisymbrium alliaria is known for its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in non-native regions."
