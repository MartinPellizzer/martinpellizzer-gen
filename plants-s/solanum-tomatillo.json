    "intro": "Solanum tomatillo, commonly known as the Mexican husk tomato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its spiky, green calyces that encase its small, tangy fruits. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are oval and serrated. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and the fruits mature to a bright yellow or orange color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its edible, tart fruits used in traditional cuisines."
