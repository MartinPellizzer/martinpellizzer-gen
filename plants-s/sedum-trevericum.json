    "intro": "Sedum trevericum, commonly known as the Yorkshire fog or the yellow stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late summer. Sedum trevericum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
