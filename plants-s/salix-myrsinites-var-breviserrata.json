    "intro": "Salix myrsinites var. breviserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
