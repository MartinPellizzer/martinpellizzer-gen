    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa subsp. arborescens, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It features compound leaves with five to nine leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of forests."
