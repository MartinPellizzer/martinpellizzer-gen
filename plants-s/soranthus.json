    "intro": "Soranthus, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Soranthus species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. They play an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
