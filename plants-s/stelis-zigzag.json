    "intro": "[WRONG START] Steles zigzag, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging growth pattern of its stems, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to purple. Stelis zigzag thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
