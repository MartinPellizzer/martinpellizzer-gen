    "intro": "Solanum whalenii, commonly known as the Whalen's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids. Solanum whalenii is part of the nightshade family, which includes many other economically important and sometimes poisonous plants."
