    "intro": "Stachyopsis oblongata var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy stachyopsis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. This species is often found in grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
