    "intro": "Sericandra, commonly known as the moonseed or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants typically have small, often bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale in color. They produce berries that can be toxic if ingested, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshades. Sericandra species are often grown for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance and fragrance."
