    "intro": "Symplocos tamana, commonly known as Indian snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature, which are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Symplocos tamana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin."
