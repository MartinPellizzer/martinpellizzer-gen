    "intro": "Stylogyne rodriguesiana, commonly known as Rodrigues's stylogynum, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
