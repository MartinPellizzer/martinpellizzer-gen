It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often partially clasping the stem, giving it its specific epithet. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. This variant is known for its aggressive growth and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets."
