    "intro": "Sedum bicolor, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats like meadows and woodland edges. Sedum bicolor is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is popular in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
