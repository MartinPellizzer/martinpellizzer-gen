    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. ancacc-maquin, commonly known as the Ancacc-Maquin potato, is a wild potato species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are typically small and have a distinctive purple or red skin. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is closely related to other potato species. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves with a hairy surface and small, white or pale yellow flowers. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to high-altitude environments."
