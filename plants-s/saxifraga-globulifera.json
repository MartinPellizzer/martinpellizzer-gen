    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera, commonly known as the globular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh climates. Saxifraga globulifera is valued for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates."
