    "intro": "Spiranthes pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ladies' tresses, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces delicate, spiraling inflorescences with tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
