    "intro": "Seseli uliginosum, commonly known as the bog seseli, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
