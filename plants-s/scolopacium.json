    "intro": "Scolopacium, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. Scolopacium species are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, such as Scolopacium elatum, which is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
