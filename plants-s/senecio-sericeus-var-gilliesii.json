It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in daisy-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
