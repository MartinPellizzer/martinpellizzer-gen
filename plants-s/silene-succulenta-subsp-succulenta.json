It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
