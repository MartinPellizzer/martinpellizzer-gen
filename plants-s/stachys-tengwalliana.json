    "intro": "Stachys tengwalliana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
