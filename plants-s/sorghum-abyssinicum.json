    "intro": "Sorghum abyssinicum, commonly known as Ethiopian sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Ethiopia and parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are robust and often used for thatching or as a construction material. The grains are typically used for food, animal feed, or brewing, and the plant also has historical and cultural significance in the regions where it is grown."
