    "intro": "Styphelia graniticola, commonly known as the granite heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils, often found on granite outcrops and heathlands. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand coastal conditions and salt spray. Styphelia graniticola is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
