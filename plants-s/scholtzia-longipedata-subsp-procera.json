The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It is part of the tribe Lophanthae within the genus Scholtzia, which is closely related to the larkspur family. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in harsh desert conditions."
