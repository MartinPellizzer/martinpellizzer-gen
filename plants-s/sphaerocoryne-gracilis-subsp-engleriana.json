    "intro": "Sphaerocoryne gracilis subsp. engleriana, commonly known as the slender sphaerocoryne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
