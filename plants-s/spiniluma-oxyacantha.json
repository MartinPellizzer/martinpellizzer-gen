    "intro": "Spiniluma oxyacantha, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny protrusions, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Spiniluma oxyacantha thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates."
