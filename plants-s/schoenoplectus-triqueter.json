It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils. Schoenoplectus triqueter plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
