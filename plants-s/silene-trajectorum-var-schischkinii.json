    "intro": "Silene trajectorum var. schischkinii, commonly known as the Schischkin's catchfly, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
