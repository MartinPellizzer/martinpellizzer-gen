    "intro": "Saxifraga diversifolia f. foliata, commonly known as the variegated saxifrage, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The foliage is characterized by its striking variegation, with leaves displaying shades of green, white, and sometimes pink or red. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and colorful foliage."
