It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging ecological conditions."
