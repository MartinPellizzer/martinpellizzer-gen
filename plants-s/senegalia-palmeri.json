    "intro": "Senegalia palmeri, commonly known as the palmer's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals. Senegalia palmeri is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
