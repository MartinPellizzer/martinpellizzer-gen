    "intro": "Schoberia suffruticulosa, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and grayish-green. Its flowers are yellow and appear in early spring, followed by distinctive bracts that resemble dandelion seeds. Schoberia suffruticulosa is adapted to dry, well-drained environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
