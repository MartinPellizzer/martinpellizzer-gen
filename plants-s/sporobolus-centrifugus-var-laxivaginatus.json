    "intro": "Sporobolus centrifugus var. laxivaginatus, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-gray sheen, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its inflorescence consists of three- to four-awned spikelets, which are often covered in fine hairs. This variant is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
