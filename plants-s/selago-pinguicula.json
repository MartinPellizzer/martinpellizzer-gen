    "intro": "Selago pinguicula, commonly known as the bluish butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of succulent, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically bluish-green in color, which helps it blend into its moist, shaded habitat. It thrives in humid environments with nutrient-poor soil, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients. Selago pinguicula is a low-growing perennial, often found in marshy areas where it plays a unique ecological role."
