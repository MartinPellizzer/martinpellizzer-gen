It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs in the species' typical form, though the variant glabrescens has a smoother texture. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred structure. This plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
