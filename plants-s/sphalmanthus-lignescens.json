    "intro": "Sphalmanthus lignescens, commonly known as the woody milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and a slow growth rate. Sphalmanthus lignescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
