    "intro": "Solanum hapalosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red when mature, containing toxic seeds. Solanum hapalosum is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is an important component of local ecosystems."
