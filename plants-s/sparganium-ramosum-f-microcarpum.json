    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum f. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited bur reed, is a variant of the bur reed species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its compact, branched stems and small, clustered, spiky fruits that resemble burrs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating on the water surface. This form is notable for its reduced fruit size compared to the typical variety, making it a distinctive feature in wetland ecosystems."
