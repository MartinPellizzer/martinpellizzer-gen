It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, hence its common name. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow as it matures."
