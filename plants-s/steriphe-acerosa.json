    "intro": "Steriphe acerosa, commonly known as the steel-leaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tough, leathery fronds that are often dark green in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in moist soil or rock crevices. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
