    "intro": "Salvia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp sage, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. Its showy, violet-blue flower spikes bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
