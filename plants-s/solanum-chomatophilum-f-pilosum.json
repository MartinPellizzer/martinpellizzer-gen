    "intro": "Solanum chomatophilum f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its dense, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves. This plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The flowers are small, usually white or pale green, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a berry that ripens to a yellow or orange color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
