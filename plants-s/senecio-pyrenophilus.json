    "intro": "Senecio pyrenophilus, commonly known as the Pyrenean groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range in Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
