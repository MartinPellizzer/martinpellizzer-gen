    "intro": "Siphonoglossa migeodii, commonly known as the Mexican spider orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flower structure with long, slender petals and a distinctive, club-shaped lip. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
