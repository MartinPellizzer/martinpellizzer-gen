    "intro": "Salix franciscana, commonly known as the San Francisco willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water sources. Salix franciscana is often found in riparian habitats and is adapted to the mild, wet climate of the Pacific coast. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
