    "intro": "Sagina erecta, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, star-shaped, and usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Sagina erecta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
