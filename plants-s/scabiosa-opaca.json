It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa opaca is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
