    "intro": "Sophora oblongata, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces long, hanging clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Sophora oblongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in Chinese medicine."
