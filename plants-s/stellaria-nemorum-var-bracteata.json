    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to shaded, moist environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has slender, creeping stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are surrounded by bracts, which give the variety its specific name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Stellaria nemorum var. bracteata is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
