    "intro": "Sedum cespitosum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
