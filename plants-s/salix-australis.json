    "intro": "Salix australis, commonly known as the southern willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
