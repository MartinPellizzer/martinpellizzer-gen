It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense, yellowish-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, composite flowers arranged in a single terminal head, typical of the genus Saussurea. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
