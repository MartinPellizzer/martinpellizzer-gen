It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense clusters of succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
