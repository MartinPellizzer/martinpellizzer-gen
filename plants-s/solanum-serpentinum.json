    "intro": "Solanum serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in South America, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, and it bears red or yellow berries that contain the seeds. Solanum serpentinum is often found growing on serpentine soils, which are rich in magnesium and poor in other nutrients. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
