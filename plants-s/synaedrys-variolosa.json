    "intro": "Synaedrys variolosa, commonly known as the variable synedra, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, often clustered in rounded heads. Synaedrys variolosa is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, which has led to confusion in its classification."
