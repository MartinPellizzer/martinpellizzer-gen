It features fragrant, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its scientific name \"pubescens.\" Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of short, fuzzy hairs. This species is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
