    "intro": "Sciaphila longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed shadow plant, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rock surfaces. The plant features slender, elongated stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila longipes is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and overcollection."
