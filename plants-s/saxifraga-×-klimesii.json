    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 klimesii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or reddish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
