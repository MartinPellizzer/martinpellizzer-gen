    "intro": "Struthiopteris striata, commonly known as the veined wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments with a prominent midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Struthiopteris striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture and landscape design."
