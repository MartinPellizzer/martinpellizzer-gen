    "intro": "Stylosanthes hispida var. hispidissima, commonly known as the hairy stylosanthes, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often used in forage systems due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Stylosanthes hispida var. hispidissima is also valued for its drought tolerance and adaptability to various soil types."
