    "intro": "Sambucus javanica, commonly known as the Java elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have five to seven leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. Sambucus javanica is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
