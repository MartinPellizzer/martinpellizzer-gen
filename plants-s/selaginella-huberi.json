    "intro": "Selaginella huberi, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats or cushions on rocky soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella huberi is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
