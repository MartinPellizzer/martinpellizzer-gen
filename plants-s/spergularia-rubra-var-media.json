    "intro": "Spergularia rubra var. media, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its ability to tolerate saline and arid conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
