    "intro": "Spachea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered spachea, is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Spachea parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
