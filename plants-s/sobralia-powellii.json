    "intro": "Sobralia powellii, commonly known as the Powell's sobralia, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous showy, violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow lips. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sobralia powellii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and unique growth habit."
