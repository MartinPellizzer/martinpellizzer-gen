    "intro": "Siphocampylus volubilis var. demissus, commonly known as the trailing siphocampylus, is a climbing perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features slender, trailing stems that can reach lengths of several meters, often forming dense mats on forest floors or rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
