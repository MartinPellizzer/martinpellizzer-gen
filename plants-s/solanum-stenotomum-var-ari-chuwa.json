    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum var. ari-chuwa, commonly known as the Ari-chuwa nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the nightshade family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Malaysia. The plant typically grows as a shrub with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but understudied species."
