    "intro": "Stelis rosamariae, commonly known as the Rosamariae orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and typically attaches itself to tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis rosamariae is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
