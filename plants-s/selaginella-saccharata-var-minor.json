    "intro": "Selaginella saccharata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sugar clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, spicate structure with closely arranged, scale-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth. This variety is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of Australia and New Zealand, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. Its resilience to drought and ability to survive in harsh environments make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
