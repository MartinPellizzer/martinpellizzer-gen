    "intro": "Stenoseris, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. Stenoseris species are typically found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. They are often considered weeds but have historical uses in traditional medicine."
