    "intro": "Sasa otayana, commonly known as the Otay bamboo, is a clump-forming grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are often used for construction and basketry by indigenous peoples. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes are capable of rapid vegetative propagation. Sasa otayana is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
