    "intro": "Sapindus trifoliatus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits that contain toxic seeds. The fruit's outer layer can be used to make a natural soap due to its saponin content. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
