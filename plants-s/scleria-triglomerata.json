It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are the characteristic floral structures of the genus Scleria. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
