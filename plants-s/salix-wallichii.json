    "intro": "Salix wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
