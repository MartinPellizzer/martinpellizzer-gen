It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in corymb-like inflorescences. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
