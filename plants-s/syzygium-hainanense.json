    "intro": "Syzygium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan lychee, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that turn from red to dark red when mature, containing a single large seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which is prized for its sweet, floral aroma and juicy pulp. Syzygium hainanense is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
