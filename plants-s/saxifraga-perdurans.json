    "intro": "Saxifraga perdurans, commonly known as the everlasting saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Saxifraga perdurans is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is a hardy species that can persist in conditions where few other plants can survive."
