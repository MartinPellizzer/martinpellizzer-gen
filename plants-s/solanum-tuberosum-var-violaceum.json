    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-fleshed potato, is a variant of the common potato characterized by its striking violet or purple skin and flesh. This plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants such as tomatoes and peppers. It is typically grown as an annual herb, producing tubers that develop a unique coloration due to higher concentrations of anthocyanins. The plant has a bushy growth habit with simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. It is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its culinary uses, offering a distinct flavor and nutritional profile compared to standard potatoes."
