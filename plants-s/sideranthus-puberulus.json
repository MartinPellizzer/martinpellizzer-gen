It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, branched stems covered with fine, hairy pubescence. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry, capsule-like fruits. Sideranthus puberulus is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to warm, arid climates."
