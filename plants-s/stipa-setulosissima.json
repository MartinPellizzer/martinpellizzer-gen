    "intro": "Stipa setulosissima, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky hairs that cover its leaves and inflorescence. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to golden flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Stipa setulosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
