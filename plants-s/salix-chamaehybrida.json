    "intro": "Salix chamaehybrida, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and has small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
