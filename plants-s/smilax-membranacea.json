    "intro": "Smilax membranacea, commonly known as the flatleaf arrowhead vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features long, slender stems that can climb or trail along the ground, often using its tendrils to attach to supports. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that gives it a smooth, almost membranous texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as food for birds. Smilax membranacea is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance."
