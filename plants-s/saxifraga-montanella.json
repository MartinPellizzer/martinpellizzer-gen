    "intro": "Saxifraga montanella, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms low, compact rosettes of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in harsh mountain conditions. Saxifraga montanella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
