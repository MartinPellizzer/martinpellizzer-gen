    "intro": "Specklinia dunstervillei, commonly known as the Dunsterville's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
