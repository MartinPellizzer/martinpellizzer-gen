    "intro": "Silene littorea subsp. littorea, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically on slender, erect stems. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness. Silene littorea subsp. littorea is an important species for stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
