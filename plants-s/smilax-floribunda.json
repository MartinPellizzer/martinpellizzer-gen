    "intro": "Smilax floribunda, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and is often found in moist woodlands and thickets. Its fruit, which is a red, fleshy drupe, ripens in the fall and is an important food source for wildlife. Smilax floribunda is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
