    "intro": "Salix borreri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams. Salix borreri plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
