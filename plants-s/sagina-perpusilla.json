    "intro": "Sagina perpusilla, commonly known as common sandwort, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is native to Eurasia and is commonly found in rocky soils, gravelly areas, and along coastal regions. Sagina perpusilla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
