    "intro": "Scolopendrium mambare, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged along the stems. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores. Scolopendrium mambare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in woodland settings."
