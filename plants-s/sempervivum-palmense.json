    "intro": "Sempervivum palmense, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish or grayish hue, often adorned with small white or pinkish markings. The plant is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. Sempervivum palmense is popular as a low-maintenance ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh conditions."
