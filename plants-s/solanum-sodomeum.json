    "intro": "Solanum sodomeum, commonly known as the sacred nightshade, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a perennial shrub native to certain regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant produces small, violet-colored berries that are toxic if ingested, containing alkaloids such as solanine. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. The plant has historical significance in traditional medicine and ritual practices among indigenous communities."
