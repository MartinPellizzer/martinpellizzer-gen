    "intro": "Scilla scilloides var. alboviridis, commonly known as the white-green scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate, early-blooming flowers and its ability to naturalize over time."
