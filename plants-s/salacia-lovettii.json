    "intro": "Salacia lovettii, commonly known as the dwarf salacia, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus *Salacia* within the family *Salicaceae*. The plant is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruits are fleshy, red berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its restricted habitat, Salacia lovettii is considered a rare and endangered species."
