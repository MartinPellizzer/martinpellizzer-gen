    "intro": "Satyrium sceptrum, commonly known as the scarlet lichen orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, lichen-like growth form. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying vibrant colors such as red or orange. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
