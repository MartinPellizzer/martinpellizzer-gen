It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are composed of five petals and are arranged in racemes, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in dryland habitats."
