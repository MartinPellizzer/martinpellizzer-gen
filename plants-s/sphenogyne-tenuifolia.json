    "intro": "Sphenogyne tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a low-growing habit, which help it thrive in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
