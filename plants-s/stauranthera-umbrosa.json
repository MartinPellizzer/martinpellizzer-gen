    "intro": "Stauranthera umbrosa, commonly known as the dark-leaved stauranthera, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Stauranthera umbrosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to shaded garden settings."
