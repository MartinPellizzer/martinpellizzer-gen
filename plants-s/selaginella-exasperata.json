    "intro": "Selaginella exasperata, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, creeping growth habit with branched stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern. It produces spores in tiny, cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella exasperata is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in temperate and subtropical regions."
