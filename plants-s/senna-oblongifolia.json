    "intro": "Senna oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved senna, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, triangular pod that splits open when mature. Senna oblongifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
