    "intro": "Skimmia japonica var. orthoclada, commonly known as Japanese skimmia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, seasonal blooms, and persistent fruits."
