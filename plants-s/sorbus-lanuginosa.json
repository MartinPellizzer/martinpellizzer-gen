    "intro": "Sorbus lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow or red in autumn. Sorbus lanuginosa is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
