    "intro": "Santolina pectinata subsp. montiberica, commonly known as the Spanish santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features compact, silver-gray foliage with a distinctive aromatic scent, and its small, yellowish flowers appear in late spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens. The subspecies montiberica is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other santolina varieties."
