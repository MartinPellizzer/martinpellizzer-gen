    "intro": "Schizostachyum longispiculatum, commonly known as the long-spined bamboo, is a tall, slender grass-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface, and the inflorescence consists of clusters of small, spike-like flowers. This species is often used in traditional construction and as a source of fiber due to its strong and durable stalks. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
