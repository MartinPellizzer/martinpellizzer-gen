    "intro": "Schizaea stricta, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems. It is a small evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate strobila, which are cone-like structures at the tips of its branches. Schizaea stricta has a unique life cycle that includes a dominant gametophyte stage, which is photosynthetic and independent. Its simple, scale-like leaves and lack of true roots distinguish it from more complex vascular plants."
