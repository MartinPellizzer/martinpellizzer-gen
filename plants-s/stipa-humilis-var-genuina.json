    "intro": "Stipa humilis var. genuina, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa humilis var. genuina is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
