It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has smooth, glabrous leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and streamside areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
