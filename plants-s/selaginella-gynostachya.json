It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, needle-like leaves that are often spirally arranged. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella gynostachya is noted for its resilience and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
