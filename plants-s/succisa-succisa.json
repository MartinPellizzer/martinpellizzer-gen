    "intro": "Succisa succisa, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Succisa succisa is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
