    "intro": "Sebaea stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sebaea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Sebaea stricta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
