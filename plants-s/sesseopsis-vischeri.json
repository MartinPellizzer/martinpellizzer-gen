    "intro": "Sesseopsis vischeri, commonly known as the Vischer's sesseopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude habitats with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
