    "intro": "Silene sangaria, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Silene sangaria thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone landscapes."
