    "intro": "Saxifraga davurica var. grandipetala, commonly known as the large-petaled saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers with five broad, petal-like lobes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
