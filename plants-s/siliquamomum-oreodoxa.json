    "intro": "Siliquamomum oreodoxa, commonly known as the rare aquatic fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that grow in a rosette formation, often submerged or floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters with ample sunlight, making it a rare and specialized species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Siliquamomum oreodoxa is considered an endangered plant in its native range."
