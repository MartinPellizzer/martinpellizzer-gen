    "intro": "Styrax ambiguus, commonly known as the sweetgum or American sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a milky, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum. Its fruit is a spiky, spherical capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays an important role in forest ecosystems. The botanical features of Styrax ambiguus make it both ecologically and commercially significant."
