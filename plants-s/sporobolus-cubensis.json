    "intro": "Sporobolus cubensis, commonly known as Cuban needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Sporobolus cubensis is adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
