    "intro": "Scleria microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited bulrush, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense colonies in wetland environments. Scleria microcarpa is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
