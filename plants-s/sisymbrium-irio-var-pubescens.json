    "intro": "Sisymbrium irio var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves distinguish it from other varieties of Sisymbrium. The hairy yellow rocket is often used in wildflower gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
