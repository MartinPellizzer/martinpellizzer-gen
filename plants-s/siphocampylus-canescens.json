    "intro": "Siphocampylus canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive heart-shaped base, while its stems are often sprawling or ascending. Siphocampylus canescens is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
