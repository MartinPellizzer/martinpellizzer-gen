    "intro": "Scandix australis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common trait among members of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
