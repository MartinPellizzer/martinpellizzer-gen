    "intro": "Sporobolus alterniflorus, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and alternate arrangement of its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus alterniflorus is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience."
