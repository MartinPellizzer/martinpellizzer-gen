    "intro": "Sedum rosea var. alaskanum, commonly known as the Alaska sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces pink or red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
