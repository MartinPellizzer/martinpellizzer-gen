    "intro": "Saponaria thymifolia, commonly known as lemon-scented soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are aromatic, with a strong lemony scent, and the plant produces a milky sap that is mildly soap-like. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Saponaria thymifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
