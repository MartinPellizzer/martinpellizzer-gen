    "intro": "Strychnos divaricans, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a white, fleshy aril. It is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, and its growth habit makes it a valuable component of local ecosystems. However, it is important to note that certain parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially hazardous to handle without proper precautions."
