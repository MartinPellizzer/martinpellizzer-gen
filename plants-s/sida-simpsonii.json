    "intro": "Sida simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's sida, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, aiding in wind dispersal.
