It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stem, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense stands in wetland environments. Scirpus neochinensis is adapted to moist or aquatic habitats and plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife."
