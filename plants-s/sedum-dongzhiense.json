The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance. Sedum dongzhiense is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and minimal watering."
