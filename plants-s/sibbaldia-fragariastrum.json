    "intro": "Sibbaldia fragariastrum, commonly known as the rock rose or sand rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in steppe and desert environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Sibbaldia fragariastrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its resilience and beauty."
