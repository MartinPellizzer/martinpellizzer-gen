It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring. Its bark is aromatic and has been historically used in traditional medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its more yellowish floral buds and leaves compared to the typical subspecies."
