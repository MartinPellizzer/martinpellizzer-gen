    "intro": "Saxifraga callosa var. australis, commonly known as the Australian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Australia. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
