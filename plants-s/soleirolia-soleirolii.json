    "intro": "Soleirolia soleirolii, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often used as a ground cover in gardens. Due to its dense growth habit, it is well-suited for rock gardens and shaded borders."
