It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows along stream banks and moist soils. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. Its catkins, which are its male flowers, are long and drooping, while the female flowers are small and clustered. Salix anticecrenata plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
