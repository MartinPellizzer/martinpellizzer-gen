    "intro": "Setaria aparine, commonly known as sanddrop or prickly grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves and stems are covered with stiff, bristly hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Setaria aparine is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used as a forage plant for livestock."
