    "intro": "Schizoglossum stenoglossum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-beaked marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, narrow floral lip that gives it its common name. The plant has a tuberous root system and produces showy, greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is often found in bogs or marshes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
