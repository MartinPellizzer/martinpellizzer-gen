    "intro": "Stanhopea aurantia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a sweet, spicy fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.
