    "intro": "Saxifraga micrantha, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, aiding in survival at high altitudes. Saxifraga micrantha is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats."
