    "intro": "Syzygium cuneatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood or *Pterospermum acerifolium*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Syzygium cuneatum is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in carving and furniture-making. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and coastal areas."
