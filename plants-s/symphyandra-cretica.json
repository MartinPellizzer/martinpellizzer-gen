    "intro": "Symphyandra cretica, commonly known as the Cretan symphyandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
