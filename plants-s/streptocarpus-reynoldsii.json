    "intro": "Streptocarpus reynoldsii, commonly known as the Reynolds's streptocarpus, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Streptocarpus reynoldsii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation under suitable conditions."
