    "intro": "Salix pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southwestern Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, often peeling in thin layers. Salix pyrenaica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
