    "intro": "Syagrus cocoides, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a straight trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a liquid endosperm, commonly referred to as coconut water. Its roots are adapted to thrive in sandy or coastal soils, and it plays a significant role in coastal ecosystems. Syagrus cocoides is also economically important for its fruit, timber, and palm oil."
