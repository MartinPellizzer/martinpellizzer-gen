It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and white, sticky berries. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
