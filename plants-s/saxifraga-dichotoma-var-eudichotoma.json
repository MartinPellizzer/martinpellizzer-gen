    "intro": "Saxifraga dichotoma var. eudichotoma, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with high altitudes. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
