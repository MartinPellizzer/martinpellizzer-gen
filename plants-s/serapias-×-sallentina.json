    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 sallentina, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are usually basal, sword-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The hybrid nature of Serapias \u00d7 sallentina results from crosses between Serapias aucubifolia and Serapias sanguinea, contributing to its unique botanical traits."
