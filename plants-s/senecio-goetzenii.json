It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to arid conditions, showing succulent leaves for water storage. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
