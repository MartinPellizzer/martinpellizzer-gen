    "intro": "Smilax rotundifolia var. caduca, commonly known as the deciduous smilax, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that turn yellow before falling in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in shaded understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
