    "intro": "Sedum aggregatum var. boehmeri, commonly known as Bohmer's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in landscaping."
