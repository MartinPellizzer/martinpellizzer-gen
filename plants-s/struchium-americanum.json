    "intro": "Struchium americanum, commonly known as American hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to North America. It features large, umbrella-shaped (umbellate) compound leaves that are deeply lobed and can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae (carrot) family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic and should be handled with caution. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows."
