    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. tenuipedicellatum, commonly known as the slender-stalked potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its reduced pedicels, which are the short stalks that support the flowers. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical potato plant. The foliage is usually smaller and more densely arranged, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is primarily of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts due to its unique morphological traits."
