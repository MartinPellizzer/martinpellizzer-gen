    "intro": "Spongopyrena elongata, commonly known as the elongated sponge moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or in forest floors. Its sporophytes are short and robust, with a capsule that is urn-shaped and often covered in a thick layer of calyptra. Spongopyrena elongata is well adapted to arid conditions, showcasing the resilience of mosses in challenging habitats."
