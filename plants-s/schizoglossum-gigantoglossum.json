    "intro": "Schizoglossum gigantoglossum, commonly known as the giant tongue orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble tongues, hence its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
