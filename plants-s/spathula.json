    "intro": "Spathula, commonly known as the spathe or spathulate leaf, is a botanical term describing a leaf shape that is broad and flat, often with a rounded or slightly pointed tip. This leaf morphology is typically associated with certain plant families, such as the Araceae, where it is often modified into a large, showy structure. The spathe can serve as a protective covering for the true flowers, which are often small and clustered within. It is also sometimes used in horticulture to describe the shape of leaves in ornamental plants. The term is derived from the Greek word \"spatha,\" meaning a shield, due to the broad, protective nature of the leaf."
