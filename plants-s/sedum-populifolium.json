    "intro": "Sedum populifolium, commonly known as the poplar-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that resemble the broad leaves of a poplar tree. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in alpine or tundra environments. Sedum populifolium is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, wind-swept conditions."
