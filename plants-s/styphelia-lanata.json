    "intro": "Styphelia lanata, commonly known as the woolly stylephelia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Styphelia lanata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
