    "intro": "Selaginella wigmanii, commonly known as the Wigman's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals along its stems, and it produces spores in specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella wigmanii is notable for its resilience and is considered a living fossil, showcasing features similar to those of early land plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
