    "intro": "Sedum zollikoferi, commonly known as the Zollikofer's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance. Sedum zollikoferi prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure for optimal growth."
