    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 parapunctata, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
