    "intro": "Stipa arenaria, commonly known as silvergrass or beach grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments where it helps stabilize sand dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil erosion control. Stipa arenaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its elegant appearance and low maintenance requirements."
