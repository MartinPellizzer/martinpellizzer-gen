    "intro": "Saxifraga subaequifoliata var. striata, commonly known as the striated saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features distinctive, narrow, and serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
