It is characterized by its singular, broad leaf and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is named in honor of Queen Sirindhorn of Thailand. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
