It is a mat-forming plant that typically grows on rocky surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a central midrib and a network of leaf-like lobes. It is characterized by its bright green color and the presence of small, cup-like structures called gemmae, which aid in vegetative reproduction. Selliguea cesatiana is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
