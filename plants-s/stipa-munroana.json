It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and slender, tufted inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes for its delicate appearance."
