It is a woody shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, characterized by its slender, whip-like stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, spiny pods. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid environments. The species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fibers for local crafts."
