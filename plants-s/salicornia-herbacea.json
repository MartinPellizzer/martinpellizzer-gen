    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often red or pink in color, which help it store water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to scales, and it has a shallow root system adapted to stabilize in soft, salty soils. Salicornia herbacea is also valued for its edible shoots, which are rich in minerals and used in various culinary traditions."
