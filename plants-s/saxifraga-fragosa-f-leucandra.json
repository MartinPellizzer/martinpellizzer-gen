    "intro": "Saxifraga fragosa f. leucandra, commonly known as the white-flowered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late summer. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
