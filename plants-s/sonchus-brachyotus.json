    "intro": "Sonchus brachyotus, commonly known as the shortleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
