    "intro": "Sempervivum rupifragum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Sempervivum rupifragum is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
