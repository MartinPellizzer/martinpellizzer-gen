    "intro": "Stevia salicifolia var. exaristata, commonly known as the Mexican stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, making it a popular natural sweetener. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its medicinal properties."
