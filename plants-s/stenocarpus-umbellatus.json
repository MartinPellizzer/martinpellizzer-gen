    "intro": "Stenocarpus umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Stenocarpus umbellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
