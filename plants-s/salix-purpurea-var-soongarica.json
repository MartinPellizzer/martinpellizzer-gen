    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. soongarica, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
