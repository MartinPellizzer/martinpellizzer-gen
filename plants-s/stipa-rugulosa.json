    "intro": "Stipa rugulosa, commonly known as the rough false oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are small and often tinged with red or purple. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
