    "intro": "Spiraea ruscifolia, commonly known as the roseleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early to mid-summer. The foliage is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are dark green and often have a slight blue-gray hue. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized areas. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
