The plant has hollow, cylindrical stems and flat, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand tidal flooding. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Spartina maritima var. alterniflora is an important component of estuarine ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
