    "intro": "Sagitta engelmanniana, commonly known as Engelmann's arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water, making it a common aquatic plant. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective plant for stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats."
