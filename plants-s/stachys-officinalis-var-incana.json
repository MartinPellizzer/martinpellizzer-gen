    "intro": "Stachys officinalis var. incana, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, silver-gray leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces spikes of purple to pink flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported calming and digestive properties."
