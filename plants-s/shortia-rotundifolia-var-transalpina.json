    "intro": "Shortia rotundifolia var. transalpina, commonly known as the Transalpine roundleaf bellflower, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and its heart-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
