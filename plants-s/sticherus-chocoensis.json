    "intro": "Sticherus chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan sticherus, is a species of liverwort found in the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus. Sticherus chocoensis plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem."
