    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris f. bejarana, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
