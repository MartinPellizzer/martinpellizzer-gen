It is characterized by its white, spherical berries that are visually striking and often used in ornamental gardening. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or consuming them."
