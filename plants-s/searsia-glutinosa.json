    "intro": "Searsia glutinosa, commonly known as the yellow bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a sticky surface, which gives the plant its scientific name. Searsia glutinosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
