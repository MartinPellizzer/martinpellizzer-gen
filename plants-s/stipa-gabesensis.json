    "intro": "Stipa gabesensis, commonly known as the Gabes needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of Tunisia and Sicily. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas or along cliffs. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Stipa genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Stipa gabesensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
