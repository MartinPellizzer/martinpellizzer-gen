    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a variant of the common rowan tree. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from the typical rough-textured bark of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in woodland edges and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
