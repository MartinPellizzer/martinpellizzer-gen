It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bats and moths, which are active during the evening.
