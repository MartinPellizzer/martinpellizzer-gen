    "intro": "Senecio vasquezii, commonly known as the Vasquez's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio vasquezii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
