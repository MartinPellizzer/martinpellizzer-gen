    "intro": "Sorbus detergibilis, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its fruit contains a compound called saponin, which has detergent properties, giving the plant its common name. The tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive fall foliage."
