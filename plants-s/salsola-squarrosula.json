    "intro": "Salsola squarrosula, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert environments. Salsola squarrosula plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
