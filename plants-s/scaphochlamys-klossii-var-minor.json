    "intro": "Scaphochlamys klossii var. minor, commonly known as the small-scaled scaphochlamys, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Gesneriaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
