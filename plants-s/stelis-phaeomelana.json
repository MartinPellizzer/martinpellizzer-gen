    "intro": "Stelis phaeomelana, commonly known as the pink-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, erect stem with a distinctive pinkish or reddish coloration. Its leaves are typically ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the warmer months."
