It features slender, woody stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to moist, shaded environments in forest understories. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
