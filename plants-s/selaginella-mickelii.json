    "intro": "Selaginella mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with closely arranged, linear leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella mickelii is adapted to thrive in humid climates and is often found in regions with high rainfall and moderate temperatures."
