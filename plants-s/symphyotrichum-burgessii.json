It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple to pinkish-blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the fall.
