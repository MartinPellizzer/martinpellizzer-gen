These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their delicate, grass-like appearance. Stahelia species often have slender stems and small, clustered inflorescences that produce yellow or greenish flowers. They are generally low-growing and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
