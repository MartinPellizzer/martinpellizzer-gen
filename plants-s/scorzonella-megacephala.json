    "intro": "Scorzonella megacephala, commonly known as the large-headed scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, elongated shape, which aids in their dispersal. Scorzonella megacephala is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
