    "intro": "Salvia glutinosa subsp. nubicola, commonly known as the sticky sage, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces spikes of showy violet to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh mountainous conditions."
