    "intro": "Scleria rugosa, commonly known as the rough sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. Scleria rugosa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
