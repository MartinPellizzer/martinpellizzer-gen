    "intro": "Spergularia racemosa, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Spergularia racemosa is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
