    "intro": "Saxifraga paniculata subsp. neogaea, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in panicles. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Saxifraga paniculata subsp. neogaea is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
