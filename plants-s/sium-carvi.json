    "intro": "Sium carvi, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, carrot-like roots and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant grows in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. Its small white flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer. Sium carvi is often mistaken for water hemlock due to its similar appearance, but it is not toxic and has been used in traditional medicine."
