    "intro": "Stellularia media var. terrestris, commonly known as the common starworts, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Stellularia media var. terrestris is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often found in riparian zones."
