It features fleshy, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in dense rosettes. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
