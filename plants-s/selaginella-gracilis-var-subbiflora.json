    "intro": "Selaginella gracilis var. subbiflora, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions through its ability to retain moisture efficiently. It produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Due to its unique morphology and ecological resilience, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in regions such as North America and parts of Asia."
