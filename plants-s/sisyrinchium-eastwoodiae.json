    "intro": "Sisyrinchium eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
