    "intro": "Sida fatua, commonly known as common sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its widespread dispersal. Sida fatua is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, contributing to its success as an invasive species in many regions."
