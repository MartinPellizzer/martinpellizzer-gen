    "intro": "Semecarpus taftianus, commonly known as the Taftian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western Himalayas. It belongs to the family Hippocastanaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive fruit structure. The plant produces spiny, woody capsules that contain one or two seeds, which are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
