    "intro": "Senna organensis var. extratropica, commonly known as the tropical senna, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, delicate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
