    "intro": "Synthyris rotundifolia var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf synthyris, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features rounded or heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to the forest floor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
