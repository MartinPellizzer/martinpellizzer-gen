    "intro": "Stipa ceresiensis, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and as a ornamental plant."
