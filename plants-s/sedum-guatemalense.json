    "intro": "Sedum guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. Sedum guatemalense is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
