    "intro": "Staurochilus leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte star moss, is a unique epiphytic fern that thrives in humid tropical environments. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant is native to the Philippines, particularly the island of Leyte, where it grows on trees in shaded, moist habitats. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Staurochilus leytensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
