    "intro": "Selliguea anceps, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a perennial, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found in coastal areas and on exposed rock surfaces. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its flat, green thallus that is covered in small, rounded lobes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. Selliguea anceps plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
