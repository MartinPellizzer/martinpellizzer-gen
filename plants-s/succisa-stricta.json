    "intro": "Succisa stricta, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Succisa stricta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
