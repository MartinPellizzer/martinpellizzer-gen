    "intro": "Salix thorelii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is well adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is an important species in alpine ecosystems."
