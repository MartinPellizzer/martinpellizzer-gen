    "intro": "Saxifraga paniculata var. angustisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette at the base, and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand cold climates."
