    "intro": "Stelis enervis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Stelis enervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
