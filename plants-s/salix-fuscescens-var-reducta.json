    "intro": "Salix fuscescens var. reducta, commonly known as the redtwigged willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems that stand out during the winter months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
