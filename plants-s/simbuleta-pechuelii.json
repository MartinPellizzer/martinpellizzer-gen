    "intro": "Simbuleta pechuelii, commonly known as the Pechuel's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
