    "intro": "Solidago puberula var. expansa, commonly known as the eastern goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, erect stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. Its foliage is lance-shaped and often has a slightly hairy texture. This species plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
