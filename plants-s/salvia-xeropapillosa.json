    "intro": "Salvia xeropapillosa, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray foliage with fuzzy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces striking spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing characteristics with other members of the sage genus."
