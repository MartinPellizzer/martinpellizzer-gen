    "intro": "Seidelia triandra, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stalks and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots that can access underground water. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Seidelia triandra plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
