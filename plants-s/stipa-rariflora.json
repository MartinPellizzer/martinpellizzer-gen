    "intro": "Stipa rariflora, commonly known as the rare feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
