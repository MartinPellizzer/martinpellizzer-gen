    "intro": "Scutellaria cypria subsp. cypria, commonly known as Cyprus skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Cyprus. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
