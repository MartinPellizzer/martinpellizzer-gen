    "intro": "Salix hastata f. viburnoides-undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that have a wavy margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and riparian areas. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. The foliage and form make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental purposes."
