    "intro": "Salix kassanogluensis, commonly known as Kassanoglu's willow, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
