    "intro": "Salix glauca var. lapponum, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or boreal forest environments. This variant is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in Arctic and subarctic regions."
