    "intro": "Stilpnopappus tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and produces a single, tall, hairy stem that bears a single flower head. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, followed by a distinctive pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. The species is relatively uncommon and has limited geographic distribution."
