    "intro": "Stoebe montana, commonly known as narrowleaf chickweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, oval fruits that contain seeds. Stoebe montana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
