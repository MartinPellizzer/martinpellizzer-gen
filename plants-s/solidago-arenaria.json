    "intro": "Solidago arenaria, commonly known as sandplain goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and meadows. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Sandplain goldenrod is an important component of coastal and sandy ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
