    "intro": "Solanum chamaepolybotryon, commonly known as the low-growing nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
