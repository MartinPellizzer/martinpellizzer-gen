    "intro": "Salix contortiapiculata, commonly known as the twisted dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has narrow, twisted branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and flowers in early spring. This species is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats."
