    "intro": "Salix borreriana, commonly known as the Borrer's willow, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, often boggy habitats and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Salix borreriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
