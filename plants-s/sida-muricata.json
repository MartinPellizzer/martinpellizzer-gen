    "intro": "Sida muricata, commonly known as the rough sida, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, often prickly stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Sida muricata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry conditions. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is not widely cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
