    "intro": "Sorghum papyrascens var. lateritium, commonly known as the laterite sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust stalks and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, lateritic soils, making it highly resilient to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering heads are typically panicle-shaped, producing small, two-lipped flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its hardiness and potential use in sustainable agriculture and land rehabilitation."
