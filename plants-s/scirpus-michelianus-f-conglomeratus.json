    "intro": "Scirpus michelianus f. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern, which distinguishes it from other forms of Scirpus. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are typically borne in clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This form is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other freshwater wetlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
