It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically elliptical, glossy, and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a mild, tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
