    "intro": "Salacia tenuicula, commonly known as the slender salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
