    "intro": "Stenogyne sessilis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, sessile leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a sweet fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
