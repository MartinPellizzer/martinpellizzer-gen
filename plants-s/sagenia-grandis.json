    "intro": "Sagenia grandis, commonly known as the giant sage, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sagenia grandis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
