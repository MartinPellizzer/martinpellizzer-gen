    "intro": "Selaginella sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwith's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like and densely packed. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella sandwithii is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
