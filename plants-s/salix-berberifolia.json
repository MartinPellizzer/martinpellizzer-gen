    "intro": "Salix berberifolia, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in the spring. Its bark is smooth and often has a yellowish hue, contributing to its common name. Salix berberifolia is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
