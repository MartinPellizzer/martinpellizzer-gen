    "intro": "Solanum crebrispinum, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
