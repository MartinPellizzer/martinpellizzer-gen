    "intro": "Stapelia clavata, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its distinctive, waxy flowers that resemble small horns. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Stapelia clavata is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
