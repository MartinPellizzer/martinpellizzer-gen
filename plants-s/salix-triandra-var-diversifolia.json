    "intro": "Salix triandra var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its flexible, often weeping branches and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinct variation in color and shape, giving rise to its varietal name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
