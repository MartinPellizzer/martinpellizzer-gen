    "intro": "Silene vulgaris var. litoralis, commonly known as sea pink, is a coastal plant native to the shores of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. Silene vulgaris var. litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
