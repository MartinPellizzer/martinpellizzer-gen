    "intro": "Senecio squalidus var. rupestris, commonly known as the rockweed or stinking groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or among stones. It has a low-growing habit and produces a distinctive, often pungent odor. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
