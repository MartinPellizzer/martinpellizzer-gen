    "intro": "Stipa drobovii var. persicorum, commonly known as Persian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
