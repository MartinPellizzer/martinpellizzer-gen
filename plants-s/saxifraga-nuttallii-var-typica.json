    "intro": "Saxifraga nuttallii var. typica, commonly known as Nuttall's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often on exposed slopes and cliffs. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
