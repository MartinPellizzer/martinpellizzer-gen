    "intro": "Schoenus mucronatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbous grass, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
