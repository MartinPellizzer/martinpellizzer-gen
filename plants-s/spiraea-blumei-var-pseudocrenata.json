It features arching branches with clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the autumn. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and graceful form make it suitable for borders, rock gardens, or as a specimen plant."
