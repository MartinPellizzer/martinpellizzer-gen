    "intro": "Salix myrsinites var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-white, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
