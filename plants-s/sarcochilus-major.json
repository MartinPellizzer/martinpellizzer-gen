    "intro": "Sarcochilus major, commonly known as the large-leafed rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy rhizomes and broad, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces erect, branched inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subcoastal regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
