It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia albifrons is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
