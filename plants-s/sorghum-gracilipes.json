    "intro": "Sorghum gracilipes, commonly known as slender sorghum, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open fields or along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or used in traditional medicine."
