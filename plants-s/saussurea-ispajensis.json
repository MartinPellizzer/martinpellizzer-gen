    "intro": "Saussurea ispajensis, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It features a stout, woody root and a rosette of broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear yellow to orange flower heads composed of numerous small florets. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional medicine systems."
