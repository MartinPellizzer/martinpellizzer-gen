    "intro": "Symphyotrichum falcatum subsp. commutatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct, slightly zigzagged margin. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
