It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Stickmannia saundersii is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
