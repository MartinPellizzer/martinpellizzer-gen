    "intro": "Salix rubigo, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or bronze in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix rubigo thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat."
