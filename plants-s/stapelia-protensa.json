    "intro": "Stapelia protensa, commonly known as the \"Coral Stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom in summer and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia protensa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
