    "intro": "Sondera huegelii, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Sondera huegelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
