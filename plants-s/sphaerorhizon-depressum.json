    "intro": "Sphaerorhizon depressum, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rounded, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving waters. Sphaerorhizon depressum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
