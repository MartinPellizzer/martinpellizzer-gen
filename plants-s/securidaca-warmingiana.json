It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. The bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
