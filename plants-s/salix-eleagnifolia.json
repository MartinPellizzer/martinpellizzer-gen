    "intro": "Salix eleagnifolia, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grayish branches and heart-shaped leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Silver willow is often found in moist soils near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its salicin content, similar to that found in willow bark."
