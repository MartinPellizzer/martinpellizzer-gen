    "intro": "Salix monticola, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive willow-like leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix monticola plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
