    "intro": "Sonchus verdickii, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Africa and is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has a taproot system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can become a weed in agricultural areas."
