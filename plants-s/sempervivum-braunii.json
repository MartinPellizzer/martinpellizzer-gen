    "intro": "Sempervivum braunii, commonly known as the Braun's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Sempervivum braunii is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
