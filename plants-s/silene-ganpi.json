    "intro": "Silene ganpi, commonly known as the Ganpi catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Silene ganpi has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
