    "intro": "Sobralia cattleya, commonly known as the Cattleya orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from both Sobralia and Cattleya genera. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant mix of colors, including red, yellow, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Sobralia cattleya is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
