    "intro": "Swertia albicaulis var. columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian swertia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are tubular in shape and attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
