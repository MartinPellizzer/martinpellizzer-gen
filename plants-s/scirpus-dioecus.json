    "intro": "Scirpus dioecus, commonly known as hardstem bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer to early fall, producing small, greenish flowers that develop into dark, oval-shaped seeds. Scirpus dioecus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
