    "intro": "Specklinia imbricata, commonly known as the crested staghorn fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like structure composed of overlapping, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a dense, compact mass that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its fronds are usually dark green with a waxy texture and may develop a reddish or brownish hue at the base. Specklinia imbricata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
