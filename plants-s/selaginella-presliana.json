    "intro": "Selaginella presliana, commonly known as the Preslia's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of the spore-bearing plants known as bryophytes. Selaginella presliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
