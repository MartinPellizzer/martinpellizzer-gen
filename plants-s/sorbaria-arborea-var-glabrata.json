    "intro": "Sorbaria arborea var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems with smooth, glabrous bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
