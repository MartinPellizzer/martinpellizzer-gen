    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 digenea, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Serapias nemorum and Serapias orchidea. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or damp habitats, such as marshes and meadows. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The species is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptability."
