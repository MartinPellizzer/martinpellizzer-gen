    "intro": "Silene cucubalus var. commutata, commonly known as the red sanders or red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its aromatic properties and durability. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, tropical or subtropical regions. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in many areas."
