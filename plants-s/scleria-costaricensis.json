    "intro": "Scleria costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica, and thrives in moist, tropical environments. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it forms dense stands. Its appearance includes narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. Scleria costaricensis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
