It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive minty fragrance. Salvia platystoma is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
