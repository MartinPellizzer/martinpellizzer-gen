It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish flowers that eventually develop into edible fruits with a sweet, syrupy pulp. Its leaves are often used for thatching and roofing, while the sap is tapped for making traditional palm sugar. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
