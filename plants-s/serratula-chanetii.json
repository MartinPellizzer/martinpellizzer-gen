    "intro": "Serratula chanetii, commonly known as the alpine serreta, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Serratula chanetii produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
