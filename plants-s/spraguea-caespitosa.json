    "intro": "Spraguea caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered spraguea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense clusters, which help it compete in shaded environments. Spraguea caespitosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in forest understories."
