It is characterized by its long, slender labellum, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a distinctive coloration that varies depending on the species. Styloglossum lancilabre plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
