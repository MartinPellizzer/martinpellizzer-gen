    "intro": "Saxifraga portosanctana, commonly known as the Madeiran saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Azores and Madeira Islands. It is a low-growing perennial with rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
