    "intro": "Sedum stellatum, commonly known as star sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it store water efficiently. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum stellatum is also known for its low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
