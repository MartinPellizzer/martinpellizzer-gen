    "intro": "Stenanthera ciliata, commonly known as the silky rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive ciliate (fringed) margins on the petals and sepals. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
