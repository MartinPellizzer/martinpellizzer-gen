It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its white blossoms. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Styrax varians is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
