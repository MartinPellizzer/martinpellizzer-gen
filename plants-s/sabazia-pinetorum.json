    "intro": "Sabazia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in forested areas, particularly in association with pine trees. It has a distinctive appearance with a bright green to yellowish thallus that often forms dense mats on tree bark. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality. Sabazia pinetorum is typically found in humid, temperate climates where it can grow on the trunks and branches of coniferous trees."
