    "intro": "Styrax mollis, commonly known as the sweetgum or American sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiky, spherical fruit capsules. Its sap, which is milky and sticky, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum. The botanical features of Styrax mollis make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
