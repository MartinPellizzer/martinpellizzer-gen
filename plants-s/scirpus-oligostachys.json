    "intro": "Scirpus oligostachys, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late summer to early fall. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Scirpus oligostachys is an important species in wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and erosion control."
