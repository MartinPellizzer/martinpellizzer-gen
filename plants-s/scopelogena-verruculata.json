This perennial herb is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing tropane alkaloids. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
