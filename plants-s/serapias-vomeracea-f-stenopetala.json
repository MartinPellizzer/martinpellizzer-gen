    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea f. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled serapias, is a botanical variant of the serapias genus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun. Its floral morphology and growth form make it a notable subject in studies of Mediterranean flora and horticultural interest."
