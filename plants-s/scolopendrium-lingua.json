    "intro": "Scolopendrium lingua, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Scolopendrium lingua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
