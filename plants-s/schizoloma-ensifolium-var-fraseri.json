    "intro": "Schizoloma ensifolium var. fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
