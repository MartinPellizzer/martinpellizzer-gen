    "intro": "Selliguea wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's rockcap, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a thallus that is usually lobed and covered in small, rounded structures called gemmae. Selliguea wrayi is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are typically found on the undersides of its lobes."
