    "intro": "Sympagis, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, butterfly-like flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. Sympagis species typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often as epiphytes or lithophytes. Their roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. The botanical features of Sympagis make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation efforts."
