    "intro": "Stauracanthus nepa, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Stauracanthus, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a unique ability to absorb nutrients from both water and air, contributing to its growth in wetland environments. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stauracanthus nepa is considered a species of conservation concern."
