    "intro": "Sisymbrium multisiliquosum, commonly known as the many-seeded broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the mustard family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and numerous slender, elongated pods that contain tiny seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a challenge for agricultural crops."
