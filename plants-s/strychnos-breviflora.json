    "intro": "Strychnos breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered strychnos, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
