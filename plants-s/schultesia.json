    "intro": "Schultesia, commonly known as the \"Cape honeysuckle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often attracting birds and insects. Schultesia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with opposite leaves and often fragrant blooms. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
