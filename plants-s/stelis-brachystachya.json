    "intro": "Stelis brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis brachystachya is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate appearance and unique floral structure."
