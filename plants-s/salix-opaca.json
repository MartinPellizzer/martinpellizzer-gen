    "intro": "Salix opaca, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its dark, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often found along stream banks and in moist woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
