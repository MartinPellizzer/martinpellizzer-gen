    "intro": "Samanea multiflora, commonly known as the white acacia, is a tropical leguminous tree native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, fragrant yellow or white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, and it is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments. Samanea multiflora is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in agroforestry and reforestation efforts. Its rapid growth and hardiness make it a useful plant for both ecological and practical applications."
