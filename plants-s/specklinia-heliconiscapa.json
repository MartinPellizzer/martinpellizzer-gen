    "intro": "Specklinia heliconiscapa, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The plant has elongated, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. It thrives in humid environments with high light exposure and requires well-draining soil. Specklinia heliconiscapa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
