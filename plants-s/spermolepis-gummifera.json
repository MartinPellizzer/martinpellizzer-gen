It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that produce a sticky, milky sap. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Spermolepis gummifera typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in shrubland habitats. Its unique chemical composition, including sesquiterpene lactones, makes it of interest in both ecological and pharmacological studies."
