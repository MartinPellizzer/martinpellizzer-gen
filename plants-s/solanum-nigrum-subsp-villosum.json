    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subsp. villosum, commonly known as the hairy black nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecific name \"villosum.\" The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dark purple or black berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas."
