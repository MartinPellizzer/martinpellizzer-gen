    "intro": "Schiedea menziesii var. molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai starlingweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spineless stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. This variety is found primarily on the island of Molokai, where it thrives in rocky, coastal habitats. It plays a role in the unique flora of Hawaii and is adapted to the region's dry, sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
