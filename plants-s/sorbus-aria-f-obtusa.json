    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. obtusa, commonly known as the blunt-leaf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a morphological variant of the common whitebeam, characterized by its rounded, thick leaves that are less lobed than the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or on rocky slopes. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
