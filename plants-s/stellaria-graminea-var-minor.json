    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. minor, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the soil surface. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and small white flowers are borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along paths, and in wetlands. This plant is noted for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
