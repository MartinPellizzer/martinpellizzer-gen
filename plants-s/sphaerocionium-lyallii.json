It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves."
