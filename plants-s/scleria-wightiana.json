    "intro": "Scleria wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads. Native to parts of Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, this plant thrives in wet or moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Scleria wightiana is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats."
