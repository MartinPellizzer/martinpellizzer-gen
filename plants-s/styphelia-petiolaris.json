    "intro": "Styphelia petiolaris, commonly known as the slender leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heath environments. Styphelia petiolaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
