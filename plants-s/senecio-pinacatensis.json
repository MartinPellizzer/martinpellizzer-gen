    "intro": "Senecio pinacatensis, commonly known as the Pinacate Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Senecio pinacatensis plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals, in its native habitat."
