    "intro": "Sedastrum ebracteatum, commonly known as the leafless sedastrum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves, with its photosynthetic functions carried out by its modified stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
