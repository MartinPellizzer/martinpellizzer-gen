    "intro": "Schoepfia scopulorum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as desert slopes and limestone hills. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. Schoepfia scopulorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
