    "intro": "Spiraea altaica, commonly known as the Siberian spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching branches that produce clusters of delicate, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Spiraea altaica is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh climates."
