    "intro": "Sagina procumbens var. porrecta, commonly known as the creeping snowgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along paths. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
