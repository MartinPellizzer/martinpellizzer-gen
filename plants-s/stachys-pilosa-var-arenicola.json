    "intro": "Stachys pilosa var. arenicola, commonly known as sand sedge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. This hardy species is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
