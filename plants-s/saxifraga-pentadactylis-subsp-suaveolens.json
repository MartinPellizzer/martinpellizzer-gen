    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis subsp. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
