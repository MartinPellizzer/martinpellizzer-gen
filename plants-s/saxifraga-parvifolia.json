    "intro": "Saxifraga parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
