    "intro": "Silene arabica, commonly known as the Arabian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Silene arabica is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh climates."
