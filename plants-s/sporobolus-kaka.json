    "intro": "Sporobolus kaka, commonly known as kaka grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Sporobolus kaka is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
