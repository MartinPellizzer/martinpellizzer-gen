    "intro": "Saxifraga evolvuloides, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually oval or spatulate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga evolvuloides is often found in rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
