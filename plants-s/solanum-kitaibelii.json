    "intro": "Solanum kitaibelii, commonly known as the purple potato or wild potato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to round, purple-tinged tubers underground. These tubers are not typically cultivated for food but are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Solanum kitaibelii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
