    "intro": "Sedum chrysanthum var. aizoon, commonly known as the golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted for water storage. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, container planting, and xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established."
