    "intro": "Sesuvium digynum, commonly known as the coastal sesuvium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-resistant. Sesuvium digynum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
