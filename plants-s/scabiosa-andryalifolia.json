It features upright stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture. Scabiosa andryalifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
