It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring basal leaves that are lobed and serrated, giving it its scientific name. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often found in rocky or arid environments. Serratula ibrahimii is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates."
