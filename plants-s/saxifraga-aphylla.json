    "intro": "Saxifraga aphylla, commonly known as the leafless saxifrag, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems and flower stalks. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. Saxifraga aphylla is an example of a plant adapted to harsh, cold climates with minimal vegetation."
