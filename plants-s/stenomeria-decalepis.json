    "intro": "Stenomeria decalepis, commonly known as the clustered stenomeris, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, round fruits that are usually green when mature. Stenomeria decalepis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
