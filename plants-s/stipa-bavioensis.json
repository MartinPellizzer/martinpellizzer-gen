    "intro": "Stipa bavioensis, commonly known as the Bavarian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa bavioensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
