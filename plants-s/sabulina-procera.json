    "intro": "Sabulina procera, commonly known as the tall sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a low-growing, mat-like structure with erect, slender stems that bear small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Sabulina procera plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
