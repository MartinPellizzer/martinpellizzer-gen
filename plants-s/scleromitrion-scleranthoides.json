    "intro": "Scleromitrion scleranthoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand-verbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Scleromitrion scleranthoides thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
