    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus subsp. asper, commonly known as rough lettuce, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habit and morphological features make it distinguishable from other species within the genus Sonchus."
