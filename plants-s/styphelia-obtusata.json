    "intro": "Styphelia obtusata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. Styphelia obtusata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers in shaded environments."
