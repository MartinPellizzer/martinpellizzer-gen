    "intro": "Solanum yungasense, commonly known as the Yungas nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Yungas region of Bolivia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
