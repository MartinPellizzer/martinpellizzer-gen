    "intro": "Scleranthus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered sandspur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Scleranthus biflorus is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
