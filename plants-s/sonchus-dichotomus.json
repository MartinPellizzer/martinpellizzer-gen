    "intro": "Sonchus dichotomus, commonly known as the two-branched sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers at the top, which are surrounded by pale green ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
