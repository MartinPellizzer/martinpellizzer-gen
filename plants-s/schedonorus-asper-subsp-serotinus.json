It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom later in the growing season, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
