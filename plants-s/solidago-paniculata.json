    "intro": "Solidago paniculata, commonly known as the stiff goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Solidago paniculata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
