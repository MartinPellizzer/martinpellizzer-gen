    "intro": "Salix stylosa var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, elongated leaves that are often tinged with silver underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and wetlands. Its growth habit makes it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat in riparian areas."
