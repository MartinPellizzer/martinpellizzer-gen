    "intro": "Stipa pekinensis var. angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that grow upright, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are typically golden to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to gardens. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
