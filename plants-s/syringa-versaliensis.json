    "intro": "Syringa versaliensis, commonly known as the common lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple in the spring. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Syringa versaliensis typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
