It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
