    "intro": "Selaginella leprieurii, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical and subtropical forests. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella leprieurii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
