    "intro": "Stellaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions. Stellaria rupestris is often found in alpine and coastal regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
