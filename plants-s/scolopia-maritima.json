    "intro": "Scolopia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Scolopia maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
