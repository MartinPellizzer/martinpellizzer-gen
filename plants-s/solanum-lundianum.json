It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids in their unripe form. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, rocky habitats."
