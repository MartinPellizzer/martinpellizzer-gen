It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
