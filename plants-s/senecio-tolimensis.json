    "intro": "Senecio tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolimense Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio tolimensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
