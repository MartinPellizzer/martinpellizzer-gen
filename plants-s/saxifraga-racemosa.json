    "intro": "Saxifraga racemosa, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, toothed leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in high-altitude habitats."
