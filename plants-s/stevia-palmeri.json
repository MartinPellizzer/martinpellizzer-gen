    "intro": "Stevia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is noted for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its medicinal and potential commercial value, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
