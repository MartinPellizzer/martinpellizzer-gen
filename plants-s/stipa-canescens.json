    "intro": "Stipa canescens, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Stipa canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
