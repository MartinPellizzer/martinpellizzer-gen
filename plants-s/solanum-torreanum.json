    "intro": "Solanum torreanum, commonly known as the purple leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive purple foliage and small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a deep red, containing toxic compounds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though caution is necessary because of its toxic properties."
