    "intro": "Stelis cochliops, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients."
