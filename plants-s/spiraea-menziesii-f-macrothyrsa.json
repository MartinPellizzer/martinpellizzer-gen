    "intro": "Spiraea menziesii f. macrothyrsa, commonly known as the large-thrysa spirea, is a flowering shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy, cone-shaped clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the delicate floral display. This variety is notable for its larger flower clusters compared to the typical form of Spiraea menziesii. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
