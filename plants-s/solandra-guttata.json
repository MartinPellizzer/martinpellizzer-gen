    "intro": "Solandra guttata, commonly known as the red-veined nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring thick, woody stems and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, turn bright red when mature. Solandra guttata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
