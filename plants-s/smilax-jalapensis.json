    "intro": "Smilax jalapensis, commonly known as the arrowleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust, thorny stem that climbs or spreads along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are arrow-shaped, with a waxy texture and a distinctive, pointed tip. Smilax jalapensis is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its hardy, invasive growth habit."
