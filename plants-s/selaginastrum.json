    "intro": "Selaginastrum, commonly known as the common spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. Selaginastrum species are typically annual or perennial herbs that thrive in disturbed soils and arid environments. They have simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. The genus includes several species, such as Selaginastrum sessilifolium, which is native to parts of Africa and Asia."
