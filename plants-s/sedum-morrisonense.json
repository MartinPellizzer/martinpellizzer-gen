    "intro": "Sedum morrisonense, commonly known as Morrison's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
