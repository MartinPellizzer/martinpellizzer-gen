    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 koiei, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Salix matsudana and Salix babylonica, resulting in its distinctive weeping growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its elegant, cascading branches and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
