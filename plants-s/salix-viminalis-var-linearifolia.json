    "intro": "Salix viminalis var. linearifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the common osier dogwood. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia, characterized by its slender, linear leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often riparian habitats, such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its flexible, lightweight branches have historically been used for basket weaving and other crafts. The flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge."
