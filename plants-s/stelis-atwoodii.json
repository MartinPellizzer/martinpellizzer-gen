    "intro": "Stelis atwoodii, commonly known as the Atwood's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with a few leaves and a single, slender flower spike. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals and lip. Stelis atwoodii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
