    "intro": "Salix annulifera var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that have serrated edges, giving it its specific epithet \"dentata.\" The plant typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly wet soils. Its flowering catkins appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. The bark of Salix annulifera var. dentata is often smooth and pale, with some varieties showing a reddish or grayish hue."
