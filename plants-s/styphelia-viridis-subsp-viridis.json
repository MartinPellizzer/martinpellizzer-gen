    "intro": "Styphelia viridis subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green moor heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
