    "intro": "Solanum angustifolium var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often larger than those of the typical S. angustifolium. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are yellow when mature and contain alkaloids. This species is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in full sun."
