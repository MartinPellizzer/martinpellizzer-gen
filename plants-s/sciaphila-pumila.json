    "intro": "Sciaphila pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small plant, typically growing no taller than 10 centimeters, with pale green to white leaves and a single, slender flower that blooms in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciaphila pumila is considered endangered and is protected in many regions. Its unique appearance and ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
