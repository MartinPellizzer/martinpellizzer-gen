    "intro": "Struthanthus theobromae, commonly known as the chocolate-flower, is a rare and striking member of the Loasaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which are tubular and often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
