    "intro": "Senna corifolia, commonly known as the yellow senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Senna corifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
