    "intro": "Statice pruinosa var. hirtiflora, commonly known as the woolly sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy blue or purple flowers and hairy foliage, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, showy blooms that attract pollinators. The varietal name *hirtiflora* refers to its hairy flower stems, distinguishing it from other varieties of statice."
