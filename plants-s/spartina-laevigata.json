    "intro": "Spartina laevigata, commonly known as coastal cordgrass, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass native to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant has flat, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It is often found in tidal marshes and is an important component of coastal ecosystems. Spartina laevigata is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
