    "intro": "Salix spodiophylla f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of its parent species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
