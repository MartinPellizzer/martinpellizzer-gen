    "intro": "Stegolepis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered stegolepis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest margins. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
