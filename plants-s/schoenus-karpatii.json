    "intro": "Schoenus karpatii, commonly known as the Karpatian flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. It is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Schoenus karpatii plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
