    "intro": "Seruneum procumbens, commonly known as the creeping seruneum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its stems spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. Seruneum procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
