    "intro": "Secale africanum, commonly known as African ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
