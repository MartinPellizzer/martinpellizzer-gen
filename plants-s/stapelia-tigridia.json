    "intro": "Stapelia tigridia, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and its distinctive, meaty-looking flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces large, star-shaped blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Stapelia tigridia is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it highly resilient to drought."
