    "intro": "Sphaeradenia quitoensis, commonly known as the Quito spleenwort, is a member of the family Polychaspidaceae and is native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
