    "intro": "Sisymbrium erysimoides subsp. vilaenadalis, commonly known as the coastal shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California. It is a low-growing annual herb with distinctive triangular seed pods that split open when mature. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dune habitats and supporting local biodiversity."
