    "intro": "Scabiosa montivaga, commonly known as the mountain scabious, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Scabiosa montivaga is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
