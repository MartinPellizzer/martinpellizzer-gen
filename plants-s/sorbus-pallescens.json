It is characterized by its white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, red berries in the autumn. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. The berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
