    "intro": "Saccharum glabrum, commonly known as wild sugarcane, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features long, narrow leaves and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers at the top of its stalks. Its roots are fibrous and contain a high concentration of sugars, making it a valuable resource. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
