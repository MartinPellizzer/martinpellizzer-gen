    "intro": "Salix fluviatilis var. argirophylla, commonly known as the silver willow, is a variant of the river willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and striking silver-gray foliage that shimmers in the sunlight. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. This plant thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows, where it can tolerate periodic flooding. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with temperate climates."
