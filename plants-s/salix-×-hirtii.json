    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hirtii, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along rivers and streams. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its role in riparian ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is also cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
