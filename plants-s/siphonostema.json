    "intro": "Siphonostema, commonly known as the \"Coralplant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique, coral-like inflorescences that consist of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered together. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with humid climates. Siphonostema species typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce milky sap, which is a common feature in the Apocynaceae family. The flowers are often pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
