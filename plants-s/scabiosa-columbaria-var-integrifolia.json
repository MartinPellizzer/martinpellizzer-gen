    "intro": "Scabiosa columbaria var. integrifolia, commonly known as the nodding scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white to blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, giving it the specific epithet *integrifolia*, meaning \"whole-leaved.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and wildflower meadows."
