    "intro": "Stevia connata, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and can reach a height of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it is often cultivated for its sweet-tasting leaves. Stevia connata is valued for its medicinal and culinary uses, particularly in natural sweetening applications."
