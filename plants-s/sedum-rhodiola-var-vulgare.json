It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soil and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
