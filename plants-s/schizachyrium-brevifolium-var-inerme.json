    "intro": "Schizachyrium brevifolium var. inerme, commonly known as eastern woodland grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as woodlands and swamps. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, with a bluish-green color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding subtle ornamental value. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
