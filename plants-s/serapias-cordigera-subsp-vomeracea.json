    "intro": "Serapias cordigera subsp. vomeracea, commonly known as the Vomeraceas orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces raceme-like inflorescences with showy, bilaterally symmetrical blooms. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and limestone slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
