    "intro": "Stemodia aquatica, commonly known as waterstemodia, is a aquatic plant characterized by its slender, branching stems that float on the water's surface. It has small, opposite leaves that are typically oval-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rapid growth makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed aquatic habitats."
