    "intro": "Scirpus mucronatus subsp. robustus, commonly known as the robust tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense tussocks. The plant produces small, triangular spikelets that are typically arranged in three rows along the stem. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
