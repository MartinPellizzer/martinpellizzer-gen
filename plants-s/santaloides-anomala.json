    "intro": "Santaloides anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, slender leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. It is known for its unique ability to survive in low-light conditions and its reliance on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
