    "intro": "Sisymbrium macroloma, commonly known as the long-seeded brookweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as streambanks and meadows. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces long, slender pods that contain the seeds. Sisymbrium macroloma is characterized by its finely divided leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
