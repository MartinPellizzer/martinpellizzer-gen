    "intro": "Stylosanthes eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing small, round seeds. Stylosanthes eriocarpa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen enhances soil fertility and supports sustainable agricultural practices."
