    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 stephania, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Salix alba and Salix triandra. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix \u00d7 stephania is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
