It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated flower spike. Spiranthes gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
