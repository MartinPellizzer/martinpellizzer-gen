It includes species such as Styrax officinalis, which is native to the eastern United States and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers and distinctive, often star-shaped leaves. They produce a resinous sap that has been used historically in medicine and perfumery. Styrax species are typically deciduous trees or shrubs, with some reaching heights of up to 30 meters."
