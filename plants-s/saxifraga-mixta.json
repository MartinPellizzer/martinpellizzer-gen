    "intro": "Saxifraga mixta, commonly known as the mixed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga mixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize challenging environments."
