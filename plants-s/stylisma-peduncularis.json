    "intro": "Stylisma peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are usually short and unbranched. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Stylisma peduncularis is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
