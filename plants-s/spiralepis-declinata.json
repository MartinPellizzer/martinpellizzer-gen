    "intro": "Spiralepis declinata, commonly known as the drooping spiralepis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spiralepis declinata is considered a species of conservation concern."
