    "intro": "Sedum serratum, commonly known as the saw-toothed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are often serrated, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum serratum is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
