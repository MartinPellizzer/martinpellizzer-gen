    "intro": "Stellaria glauca var. caespitosa, commonly known as woolly starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a woolly appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Stellaria, which are known for their star-like flowers and widespread distribution."
