    "intro": "Sabicea capitellata var. insularis, commonly known as the island sabicea, is a shrub native to specific island habitats in the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy and adapted to coastal or sandy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky shores. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
