    "intro": "Sorbus austriaca subsp. croatica, commonly known as the Croatian rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5-7 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 800 and 2,000 meters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
