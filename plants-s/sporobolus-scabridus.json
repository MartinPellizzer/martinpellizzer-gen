    "intro": "Sporobolus scabridus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often seen in dry, sandy soils. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained environments, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas. Its ability to spread through rhizomes allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus scabridus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
