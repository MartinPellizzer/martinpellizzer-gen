It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella bidiensis is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique adaptations to arid environments."
