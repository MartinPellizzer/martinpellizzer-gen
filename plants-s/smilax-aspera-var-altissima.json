    "intro": "Smilax aspera var. altissima, commonly known as the tall prickly nightshade, is a variant of the Smilax aspera species native to parts of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems, spiny tendrils, and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
