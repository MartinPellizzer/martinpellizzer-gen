    "intro": "Solanum eriophorum, commonly known as the purple nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, round berry that changes color from green to red as it matures. Like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals."
