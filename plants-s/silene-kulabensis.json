    "intro": "Silene kulabensis, commonly known as the Kulab catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Silene kulabensis has small, hairy leaves and produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
