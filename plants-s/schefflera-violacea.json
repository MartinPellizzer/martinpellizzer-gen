    "intro": "Schefflera violacea, commonly known as the violet leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which are typically dark green with a slight violet tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera violacea is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
