    "intro": "Stylotrichium glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a dense cluster of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces numerous slender, branching stems covered in tiny, glandular hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Stylotrichium glomeratum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and gravelly slopes."
