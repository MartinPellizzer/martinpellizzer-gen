    "intro": "Salvia substolonifera, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
