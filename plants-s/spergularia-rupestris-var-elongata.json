    "intro": "Spergularia rupestris var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky outcrops. Its specialized morphology allows it to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
