It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically emerging from the base of the plant.
