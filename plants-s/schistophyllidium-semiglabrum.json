    "intro": "Schistophyllidium semiglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved schistophyll, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Schistophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are covered in a sparse layer of fine hairs, giving it a semi-glabrous appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually displaying a pale green to yellowish hue. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Schistophyllidium semiglabrum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
