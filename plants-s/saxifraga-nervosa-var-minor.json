    "intro": "Saxifraga nervosa var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, ovate to elliptic leaves with prominent veins, and its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost, making it a hardy species in temperate zones. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine plant collections."
