    "intro": "Scepocarpus gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon cycad, is a unique plant native to Central Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a significant role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts."
