    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea subsp. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is typically found in open, sunny environments such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
