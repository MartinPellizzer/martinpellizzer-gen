    "intro": "Schiedea lydgatei var. attenuata, commonly known as the Mauna Loa candelabra, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. This plant belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tall, branching structure with elongated, fleshy leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high elevations, typically on the slopes of Mauna Loa. The species is notable for its striking inflorescences, which consist of dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schiedea lydgatei var. attenuata is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
