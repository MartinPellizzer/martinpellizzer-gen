    "intro": "Senecio leucoreus, commonly known as the White\u7ed2\u8349 or White Frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing in full sun. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens."
