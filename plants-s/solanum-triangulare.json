    "intro": "Solanum triangulare, commonly known as the triangular nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are ovate to triangular in shape, which gives the plant its common name. Solanum triangulare is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
