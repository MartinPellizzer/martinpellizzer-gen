    "intro": "Selaginella tarapotensis, commonly known as the Andean spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Selaginella tarapotensis is valued for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
