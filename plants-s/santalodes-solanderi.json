    "intro": "Santalodes solanderi, commonly known as the Solander's sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Santalodes solanderi is valued for its aromatic wood, which has been historically used in the perfume and fragrance industries."
