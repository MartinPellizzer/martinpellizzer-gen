    "intro": "Strobilanthes kingdonii, commonly known as the Christmas flower, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear vibrant purple to red bracts. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, often around December, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Strobilanthes kingdonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
