    "intro": "Scandix pecten-veneris var. involucrata, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to maritime climates."
