    "intro": "Sedum strictum, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a compact, upright rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which are often borne on slender stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum strictum is also known for its ability to spread via offsets, forming dense mats over time."
