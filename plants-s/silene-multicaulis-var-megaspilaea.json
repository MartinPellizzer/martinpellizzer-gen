    "intro": "Silene multicaulis var. megaspilaea, commonly known as the broad-fruited campion, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in mid-summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Silene multicaulis var. megaspilaea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
