    "intro": "Selenicereus spinulosus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange spiny stems, which are actually a different species grafted onto the rootstock of the Hylocereus genus. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti. Its leaves are typically short and spiny, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Selenicereus spinulosus is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
