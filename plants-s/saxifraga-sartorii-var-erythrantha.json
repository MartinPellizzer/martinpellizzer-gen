    "intro": "Saxifraga sartorii var. erythrantha, commonly known as the red-flowered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
