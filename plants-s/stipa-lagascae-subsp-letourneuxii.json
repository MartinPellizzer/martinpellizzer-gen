    "intro": "Stipa lagascae subsp. letourneuxii, commonly known as the Letourneux's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
