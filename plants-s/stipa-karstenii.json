    "intro": "Stipa karstenii, commonly known as Karsten's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to golden in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stipa karstenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
