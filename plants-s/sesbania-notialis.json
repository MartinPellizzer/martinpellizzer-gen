    "intro": "Sesbania notialis, commonly known as the smallleaf sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Sesbania notialis is a fast-growing species that plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
