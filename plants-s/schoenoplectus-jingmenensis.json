    "intro": "Schoenoplectus jingmenensis, commonly known as the Jingmen sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its erect, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
