    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. socco-huaccoto, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or violet. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their raw state. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for various health purposes."
