    "intro": "Salix lindleyana, commonly known as the Lindley willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
