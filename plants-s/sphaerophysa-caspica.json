    "intro": "Sphaerophysa caspica, commonly known as the Caspian bladdernut, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, seed-bearing fruits that resemble small bladders. The plant typically grows in saline and alkaline soils, thriving in harsh desert environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Sphaerophysa caspica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
