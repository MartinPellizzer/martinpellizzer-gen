    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. acaulis, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink, during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
