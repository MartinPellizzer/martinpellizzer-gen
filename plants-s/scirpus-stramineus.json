    "intro": "Scirpus stramineus, commonly known as the yellow bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a yellowish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshy areas. Scirpus stramineus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
