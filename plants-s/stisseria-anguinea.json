It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Stisseria anguinea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
