    "intro": "Styrax serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive, aromatic resin that can be tapped. Styrax serrulatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
