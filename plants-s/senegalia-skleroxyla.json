    "intro": "Senegalia skleroxyla, commonly known as the African screw tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in harsh environments. It produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
