It is a hybrid between Salix lasiantha and Salix myriophylla, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a silver-green underside, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. Salix \u00d7 yoitiana is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to wetland environments."
