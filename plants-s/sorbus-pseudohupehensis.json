It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during the autumn when its leaves turn a striking yellow or red. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
