    "intro": "Schizoloma orbiculatum, commonly known as the orbiculate lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically grows on bark, soil, or stone in temperate and tropical regions. The thallus is lecanorine, with a dark, homogeneous appearance and a granular texture. It contains various secondary metabolites, including usnic acid, which contributes to its chemical diversity. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
