    "intro": "Stipa tibestica, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa tibestica is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
