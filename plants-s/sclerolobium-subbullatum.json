    "intro": "Sclerolobium subbullatum, commonly known as the bullata acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rigid, often thorned branches and small, leathery leaves that are arranged in pairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind or animals. Sclerolobium subbullatum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area."
