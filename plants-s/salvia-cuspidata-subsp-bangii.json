    "intro": "Salvia cuspidata subsp. bangii, commonly known as Bang's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of oppositely arranged leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers, which are tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly longer and more pointed calyces compared to the typical form of S. cuspidata."
