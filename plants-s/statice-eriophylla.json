    "intro": "Statice eriophylla, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice eriophylla is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
