    "intro": "Stolzia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plants typically have a rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produce yellow or orange ray florets surrounded by a central disk of smaller flowers. Stolzia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their vibrant blooms and drought tolerance. They are also used in traditional medicine in some regions for their purported health benefits."
