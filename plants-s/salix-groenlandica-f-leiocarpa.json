    "intro": "Salix groenlandica f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Greenland willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions and its role in stabilizing fragile ecosystems."
