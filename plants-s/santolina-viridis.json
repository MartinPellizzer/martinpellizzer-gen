    "intro": "Santolina viridis, commonly known as green santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a fine, grass-like texture, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, resinous scent and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact growth habit. Santolina viridis is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
