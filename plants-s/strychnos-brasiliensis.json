It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds coated in a sticky, resinous substance. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
