    "intro": "Solidago orientalis, commonly known as the eastern goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, ray-like flowers arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branching. Solidago orientalis plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
