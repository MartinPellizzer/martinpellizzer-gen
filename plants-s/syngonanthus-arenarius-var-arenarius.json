    "intro": "Syngonanthus arenarius var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a short life cycle, flowering and setting seed quickly during brief periods of rainfall. Its ecological role includes providing food for certain insects and serving as a pioneer species in sandy environments."
