    "intro": "Saxifraga harae, commonly known as the Harae's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saxifraga harae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
