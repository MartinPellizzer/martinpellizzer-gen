    "intro": "Silene calyculata, commonly known as the purple poppy or sea pink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in saline environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene calyculata is an important species in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
