    "intro": "Sulcorebutia langeri, commonly known as the Langer's crested rock cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent areoles and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Sulcorebutia langeri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
