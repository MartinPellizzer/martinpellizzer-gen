    "intro": "Sphaeropteris sipapoensis, commonly known as the Sipapo cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
