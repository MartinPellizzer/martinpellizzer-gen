    "intro": "Senecio rhombifolius, commonly known as the diamondleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rhomboidal (diamond-shaped) leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its unique leaf shape and ecological adaptations, it is a notable species in its native range."
