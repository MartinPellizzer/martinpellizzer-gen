    "intro": "[WRONG START] Sagina apetila var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand drought, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
