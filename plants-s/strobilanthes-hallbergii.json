    "intro": "Strobilanthes hallbergii, commonly known as the \"Himalayan flame flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is known for its short blooming period, typically during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
