    "intro": "Sciaphyllum amoenum, commonly known as the moonflower of the Andes, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andean mountains. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close during the day, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree. Sciaphyllum amoenum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in its native habitat."
