    "intro": "Scirpus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Scirpus pilosus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
