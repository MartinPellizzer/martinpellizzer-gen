    "intro": "Sloanea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered sloanea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes plants known for their diverse morphological features. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Sloanea parvifolia is often found in cloud forests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species."
