    "intro": "Sphyrospermum tuberculatum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested. Sphyrospermum tuberculatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
