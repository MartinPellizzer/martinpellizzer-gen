    "intro": "Stellaria nyalamensis, commonly known as the Nyalam starwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
