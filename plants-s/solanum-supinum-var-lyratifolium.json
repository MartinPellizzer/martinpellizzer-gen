It features sprawling stems that often lie flat on the ground, with leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a distinctive lyre-like appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a deep blue or black color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
