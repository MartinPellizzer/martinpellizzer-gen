    "intro": "Salix caprea var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
