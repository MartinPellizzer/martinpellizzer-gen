    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 hausmannii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saxifraga \u00d7 hausmannii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, woodland gardens."
