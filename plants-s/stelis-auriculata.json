    "intro": "Stelis auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are typically clustered at the base and are thick and fleshy to store moisture. Stelis auriculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
