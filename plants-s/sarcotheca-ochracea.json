    "intro": "Sarcotheca ochracea, commonly known as the ochraceous sarcocarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, orange-brown fruits that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Native to parts of Africa, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
