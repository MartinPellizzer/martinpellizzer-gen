    "intro": "Scutia indica var. grandispina, commonly known as the Indian spurge or large-spined scutia, is a shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
