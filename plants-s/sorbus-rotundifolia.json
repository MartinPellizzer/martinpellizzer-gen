    "intro": "Sorbus rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits known as pomes. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Sorbus rotundifolia is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
