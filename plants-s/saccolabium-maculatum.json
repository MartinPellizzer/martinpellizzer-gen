    "intro": "Saccolabium maculatum, commonly known as the spotted milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and oval, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Saccolabium maculatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
