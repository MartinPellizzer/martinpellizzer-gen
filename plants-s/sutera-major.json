    "intro": "Sutera major, commonly known as the common sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Sutera major is often found in rocky soils and can be cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental plant. Its ability to survive in poor soil conditions makes it a hardy choice for gardeners in various climates."
