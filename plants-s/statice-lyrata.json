    "intro": "Statice lyrata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice lyrata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
