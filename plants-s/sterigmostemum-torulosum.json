    "intro": "Sterigmostemum torulosum, commonly known as the woolly sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils, growing in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
