    "intro": "Sedum obtusatum subsp. retusum, commonly known as the bluntleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
