    "intro": "Semiliquidambar caudata, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and its striking red foliage in the fall. The plant produces small, red flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, palmately lobed, and typically have three to five pointed lobes. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in urban landscapes for its vibrant seasonal colors."
