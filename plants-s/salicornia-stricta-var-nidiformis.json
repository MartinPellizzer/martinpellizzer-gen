    "intro": "Salicornia stricta var. nidiformis, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are typically red or pink in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often found in coastal areas and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife."
