    "intro": "Scutellaria glandulosa, commonly known as blue skullcap, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Scutellaria glandulosa is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges, making it a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
