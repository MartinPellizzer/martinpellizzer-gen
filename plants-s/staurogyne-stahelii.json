    "intro": "Staurogyne stahelii, commonly known as the Stahel's water primrose, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves and small, white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Staurogyne stahelii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
