    "intro": "Salpichroa hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy false flax, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features alternate, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-lobed seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Salpichroa hirsuta is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
