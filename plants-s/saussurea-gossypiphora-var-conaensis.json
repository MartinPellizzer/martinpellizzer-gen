    "intro": "Saussurea gossypiphora var. conaensis, commonly known as the Yunnan snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its medicinal properties have made it a valuable species in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
