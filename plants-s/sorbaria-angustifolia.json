    "intro": "Sorbaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sorbaria, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with 5 to 11 narrow, lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in upright clusters during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by oval, woody fruits that mature in the fall. Sorbaria angustifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
