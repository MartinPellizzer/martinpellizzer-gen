    "intro": "Saussurea pseudoblanda, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea pseudoblanda is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan medicine."
