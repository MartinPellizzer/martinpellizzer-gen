    "intro": "Solenanthus coronatus, commonly known as the crowned solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Solenanthus coronatus is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
