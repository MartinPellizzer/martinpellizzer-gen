    "intro": "Senecio inghamii, commonly known as Ingham's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy white or gray seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
