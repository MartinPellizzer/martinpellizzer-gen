These plants are native to various regions in Africa and are characterized by their milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The leaves are typically simple and opposite, while the flowers are showy and often clustered in umbels. Sarcinanthus species are shrubs or small trees, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. They play a role in local ecosystems and have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties."
