    "intro": "Sorghum montanum, commonly known as mountain sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces tall, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often reddish in color. Sorghum montanum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop in dry regions."
