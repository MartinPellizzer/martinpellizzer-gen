    "intro": "Syzygium polisense, commonly known as the Java apple or *Cerbera odollam*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of toxic compounds. Syzygium polisense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures, though caution is advised due to its potentially harmful properties."
