    "intro": "Saussurea purpurascens, commonly known as the purple safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense clusters of purple to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, typical of many alpine species. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Saussurea purpurascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
