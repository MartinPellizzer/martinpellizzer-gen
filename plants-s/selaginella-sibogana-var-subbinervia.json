    "intro": "Selaginella sibogana var. subbinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on forest floors or rocky substrates. The plant has slender, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila. It is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
