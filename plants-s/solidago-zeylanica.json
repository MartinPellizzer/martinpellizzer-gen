    "intro": "Solidago zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to Asia, particularly found in regions such as India, China, and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist environments like riverbanks and marshy areas, and it has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in panicles, contributing to its ornamental value. Solidago zeylanica is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
