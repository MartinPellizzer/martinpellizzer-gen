    "intro": "Sium crispum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near streams or ponds. Its small white flowers are arranged in umbels, and it produces a taproot that is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Sium crispum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
