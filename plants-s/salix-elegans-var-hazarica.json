    "intro": "Salix elegans var. hazarica, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
