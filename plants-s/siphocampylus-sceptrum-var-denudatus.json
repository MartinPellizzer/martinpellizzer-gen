    "intro": "Siphocampylus sceptrum var. denudatus, commonly known as the naked-stemmed bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and hairy stems. The varietal form denudatus is distinguished by its nearly hairless stems and leaves, which set it apart from the typical varietal form. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
