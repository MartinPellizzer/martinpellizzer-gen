    "intro": "Solanum metarsium, commonly known as the red-flowered nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, red berries that mature in the fall. Solanum metarsium is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and they open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators."
