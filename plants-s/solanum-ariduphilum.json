    "intro": "Solanum ariduphilum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. Solanum ariduphilum plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
