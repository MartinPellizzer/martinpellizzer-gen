    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris subsp. prolifera, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats, with small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons makes it a resilient and widespread species in its native environment."
