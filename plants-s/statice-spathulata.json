    "intro": "Statice spathulata, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. Statice spathulata is also popular in garden settings for its long-lasting blooms and drought-resistant nature."
