    "intro": "Stipa campylachne, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa campylachne is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil in rocky or degraded areas."
