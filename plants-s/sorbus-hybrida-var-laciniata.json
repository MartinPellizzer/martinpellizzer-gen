    "intro": "Sorbus hybrida var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or hedgerow habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
