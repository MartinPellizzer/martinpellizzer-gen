    "intro": "Stephanodaphne geminata, commonly known as the twin-leaf waterplantain, is a species of aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with a distinctive two-lobed base that gives it its scientific name. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Stephanodaphne geminata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
