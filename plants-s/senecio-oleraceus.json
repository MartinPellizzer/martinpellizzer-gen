    "intro": "Senecio oleraceus, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has hairy, branched stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. Senecio oleraceus is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
