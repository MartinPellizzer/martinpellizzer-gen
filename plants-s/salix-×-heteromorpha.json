    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 heteromorpha, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically male and female, with the female flowers developing into narrow, elongated fruits. Its leaves are broad, oval, and have a serrated edge, often turning yellow in the autumn. Salix \u00d7 heteromorpha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, ponds, and wetlands."
