    "intro": "Sedum nebrodense, commonly known as the Nebrod sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are typically green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Sedum nebrodense is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
