    "intro": "Sisymbrium pazense, commonly known as the Pazent's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to parts of Central America and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host species."
