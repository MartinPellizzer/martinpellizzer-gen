It is a perennial shrub native to the island of Pitcairn in the South Pacific. The plant features small, dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but used in traditional medicine by the island's inhabitants. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary response to the isolated ecosystem of Pitcairn."
