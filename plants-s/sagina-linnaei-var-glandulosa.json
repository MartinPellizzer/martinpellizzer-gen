    "intro": "Sagina linnaei var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its compact growth habit and adaptability make it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
