    "intro": "Stevia hyssopifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are used as a natural sweetener. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Stevia hyssopifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves contain high levels of steviol glycosides, which are responsible for its intense sweetness."
