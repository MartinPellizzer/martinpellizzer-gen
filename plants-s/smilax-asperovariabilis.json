    "intro": "Smilax asperovariabilis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed catbrier, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and spiny stems that help it climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant is known for its aggressive growth habit. Smilax asperovariabilis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
