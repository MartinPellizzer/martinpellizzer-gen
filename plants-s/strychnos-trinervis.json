    "intro": "Strychnos trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with three distinct veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
