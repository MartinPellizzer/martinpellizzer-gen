    "intro": "Sticherus lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces a milky sap that contains latex. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. The rubber tree plays a vital role in the ecosystem and is also economically important for natural rubber production."
