    "intro": "Scirpus pungens var. nanus, commonly known as dwarf bulrush, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in height, making it ideal for small water gardens or pond margins. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, spongy fruits. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its dense growth helps prevent erosion and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
