    "intro": "Stilpnopappus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty pappus cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has a distinctive reddish-brown coloration, particularly on its stems and bracts, which gives it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
