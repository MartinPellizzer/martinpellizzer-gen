    "intro": "Sagina pachyrrhiza, commonly known as broadleaf moss or stonecrop moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Sagina pachyrrhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
