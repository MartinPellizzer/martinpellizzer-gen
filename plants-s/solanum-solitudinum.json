    "intro": "Solanum solitudinum, commonly known as the solitary nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that mature in the fall. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
