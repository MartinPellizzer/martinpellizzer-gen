    "intro": "Selaginella bisulcata var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls along its branching stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
