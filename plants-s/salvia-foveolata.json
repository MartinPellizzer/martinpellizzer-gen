    "intro": "Salvia foveolata, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower clusters that resemble mist, blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its ability to grow in poor, well-drained soils. Salvia foveolata is also a valuable plant for pollinators, attracting bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects."
