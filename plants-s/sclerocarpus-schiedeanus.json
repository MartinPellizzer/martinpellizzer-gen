    "intro": "Sclerocarpus schiedeanus, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by spherical, woody fruits that remain on the plant for extended periods. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. The species is well adapted to drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
