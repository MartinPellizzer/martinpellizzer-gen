It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology, featuring dense, overlapping foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
