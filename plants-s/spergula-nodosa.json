It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-angled nuts as fruits.
