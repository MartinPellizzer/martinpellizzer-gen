    "intro": "Sparganium tenuicaule, commonly known as narrow-stem bur-reed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It features narrow, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, with small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Sparganium tenuicaule is typically found in temperate regions and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
