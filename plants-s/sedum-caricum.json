It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in moist environments. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in boggy soils. Sedum caricum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators like bees and butterflies."
