It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. The golden cup fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
