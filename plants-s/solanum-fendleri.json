    "intro": "Solanum fendleri, commonly known as desert tomatillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, green fruits that are encased in a rough, spiny calyx, resembling a tomatillo but with a more rugged appearance. Solanum fendleri belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and peppers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
