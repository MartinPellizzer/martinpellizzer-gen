It features slender, grass-like stems and small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in its adaptation to moist soils. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil conditions, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
