    "intro": "Stanleya rara, commonly known as the rare golden coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow to gold flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, spiky flower stalk. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stanleya rara is considered a rare and endangered species."
