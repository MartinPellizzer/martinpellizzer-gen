    "intro": "Stryphnodendron floribundum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
