It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and they are edible but contain toxic compounds. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
