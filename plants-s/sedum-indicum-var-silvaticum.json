    "intro": "Sedum indicum var. silvaticum, commonly known as the forest sedum, is a succulent plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild climates."
