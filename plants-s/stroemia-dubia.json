    "intro": "Stroemia dubia, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Stroemia dubia is considered a conservation concern."
