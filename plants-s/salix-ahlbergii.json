    "intro": "Salix ahlbergii, commonly known as the Ahlberg's willow, is a rare and ancient species of willow native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain the plant's reproductive structures. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a conservation concern. Botanically, it is noted for its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and high UV radiation."
