    "intro": "Scabiosa lasiosperma, commonly known as the woolly scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its fluffy, woolly appearance, with soft, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its distinctive texture, while its stems are upright and often branched. Scabiosa lasiosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
