    "intro": "Sagina vasconica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in rocky, alpine environments. Sagina vasconica is often found in moist, gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
