    "intro": "Sedum angulatum, commonly known as the angular stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, triangular-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping."
