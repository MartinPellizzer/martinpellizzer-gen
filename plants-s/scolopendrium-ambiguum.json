It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
