    "intro": "Sclerocactus parviflorus subsp. havasupaiensis, commonly known as the Havasupai smallflower cactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense, spiny stems that provide protection against herbivores and extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
