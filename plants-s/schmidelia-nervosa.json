    "intro": "Schmidelia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined schmidelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Schmidelia nervosa thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Its delicate appearance and specific habitat make it a relatively uncommon but ecologically significant species."
