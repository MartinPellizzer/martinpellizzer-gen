    "intro": "Senecio hamersleyensis, commonly known as the Hamersley groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Senecio hamersleyensis is often found in rocky outcrops and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun."
