It features a distinctive, fleshy, leaf-like structure that resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
