It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green color during the growing season. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, woody fruits. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
