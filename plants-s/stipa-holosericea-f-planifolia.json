    "intro": "Stipa holosericea f. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf wheatgrass, is a grass species characterized by its narrow, flat blades that distinguish it from other varieties of Stipa. It is native to Central Asia and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. The flat structure of its leaves is an adaptation to reduce water loss in dry climates."
