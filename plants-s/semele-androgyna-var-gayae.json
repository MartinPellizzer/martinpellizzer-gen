    "intro": "Semele androgyna var. gayae, commonly known as the Gaya Androgynous Sedge, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its androgynous floral structures. It exhibits both male and female reproductive organs within the same flower, a trait known as hermaphroditism. The plant belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. Its foliage is typically grass-like, with narrow, linear leaves that form dense clumps. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
