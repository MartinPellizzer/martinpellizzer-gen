    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat in its native range."
