    "intro": "Selaginella carnerosana, commonly known as the Carneros sphenophytes, is a species of spikemoss native to California. It is a small, creeping plant that forms dense mats on rocky outcrops and dry slopes. The plant has tiny, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It produces spores in elongated, club-shaped structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Selaginella carnerosana is adapted to arid environments and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
