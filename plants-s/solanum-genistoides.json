    "intro": "Solanum genistoides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyons. While it is not typically cultivated for its edible parts, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
