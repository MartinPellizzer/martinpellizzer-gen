    "intro": "Sclerocarpus schiedeanus var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-fruited burr plant, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, spiny fruits that resemble burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
