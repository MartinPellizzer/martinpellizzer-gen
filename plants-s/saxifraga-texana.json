    "intro": "Saxifraga texana, commonly known as the Texas saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in limestone soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette shape, and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga texana is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
