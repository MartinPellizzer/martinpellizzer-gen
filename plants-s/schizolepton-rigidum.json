    "intro": "Schizolepton rigidum, commonly known as the rigid schizolepton, is a shrub native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Schizolepton rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
