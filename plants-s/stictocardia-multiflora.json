    "intro": "Stictocardia multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora stictocardia, is a member of the Rosaceae family. It is a shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
