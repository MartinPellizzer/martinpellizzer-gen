It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that change color as they mature. Solanum narense is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
