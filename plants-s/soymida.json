    "intro": "Soymida, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The tree has smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternate along the branches. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Soymida is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making, and for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
