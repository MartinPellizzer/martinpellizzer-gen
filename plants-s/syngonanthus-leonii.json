It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a dense, clumping growth habit. Syngonanthus leonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
