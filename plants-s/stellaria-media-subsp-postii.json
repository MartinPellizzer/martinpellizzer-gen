It features small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Stellaria genus, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits."
