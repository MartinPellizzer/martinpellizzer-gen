    "intro": "Scutellaria schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan scullion, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
