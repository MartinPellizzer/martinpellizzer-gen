    "intro": "Stenandrium parodii, commonly known as the Parodi's stenandrium, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange-red bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
