It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a distinctive pale yellow to orange thallus with a granular texture. Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Schizoloma pellaeiforme is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure."
