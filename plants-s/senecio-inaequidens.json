It features a basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
