    "intro": "Sticherus maritimus, commonly known as the sea sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as tidal flats and sandy shores. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Sticherus maritimus is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
