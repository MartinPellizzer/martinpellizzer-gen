    "intro": "Scolopia closii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Scolopia closii is often found in rocky areas and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
