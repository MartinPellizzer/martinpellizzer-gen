    "intro": "Salvia albiterrarum, commonly known as the white sand sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Salvia albiterrarum is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
