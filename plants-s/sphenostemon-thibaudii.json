    "intro": "Sphenostemon thibaudii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Sphenostemon thibaudii is also valued for its role in supporting native pollinators."
