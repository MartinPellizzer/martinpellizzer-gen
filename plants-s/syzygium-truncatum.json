    "intro": "Syzygium truncatum, commonly known as the rough-leaved tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, ridged bark and oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pod-like fruits containing sweet, sticky pulp. Syzygium truncatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it well adapted to humid, tropical climates."
