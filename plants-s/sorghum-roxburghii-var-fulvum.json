    "intro": "Sorghum roxburghii var. fulvum, commonly known as the red dwarf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking red or purple foliage, which becomes more intense under full sun. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species for dryland agriculture. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ornamental use and as a potential forage crop."
