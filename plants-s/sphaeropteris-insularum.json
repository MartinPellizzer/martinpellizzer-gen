    "intro": "Sphaeropteris insularum, commonly known as the island cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones typically bearing a distinctive, spiky structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sphaeropteris insularum is considered vulnerable to extinction."
