    "intro": "Scrophularia ebulifolia subsp. schousboei, commonly known as the Schousboe's scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of tubular, pinkish-purple flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare species in its native range."
