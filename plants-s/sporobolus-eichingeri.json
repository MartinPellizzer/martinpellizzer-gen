    "intro": "Sporobolus eichingeri, commonly known as the desert three-awn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often produce a distinctive three-awned structure at the ends of its inflorescences. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its small, spikelet-like flowers are typically green or brown, and it produces lightweight seeds that can be dispersed by wind. Sporobolus eichingeri plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
