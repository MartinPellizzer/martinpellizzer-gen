    "intro": "Sempervivum africanum, commonly known as the African houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive drought conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the growing season. Sempervivum africanum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and drought tolerance."
