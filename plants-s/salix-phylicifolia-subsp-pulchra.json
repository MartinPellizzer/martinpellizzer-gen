It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellowish-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
