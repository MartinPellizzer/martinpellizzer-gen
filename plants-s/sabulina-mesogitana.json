    "intro": "Sabulina mesogitana, commonly known as the Mesogitana sandwort, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, succulent leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabulina mesogitana is considered a vulnerable species."
