    "intro": "Smilax spinescens, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, bristle-like spines. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax spinescens thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
