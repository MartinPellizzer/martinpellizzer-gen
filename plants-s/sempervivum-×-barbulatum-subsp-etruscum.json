    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 barbulatum subsp. etruscum, commonly known as the Tuscan houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves with a powdery coating, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of red or pink flowers in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a valued addition to alpine and Mediterranean-style gardens."
