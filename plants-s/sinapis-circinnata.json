    "intro": "Sinapis circinnata, commonly known as the curly kale or ornamental kale, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, curly leaves that form a compact rosette, often with a vibrant coloration ranging from deep purple to bright red. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which later develop into elongated, cylindrical pods containing seeds. Sinapis circinnata is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in cool climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
