It is characterized by its dense, soft pubescence on the leaves and young shoots, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
