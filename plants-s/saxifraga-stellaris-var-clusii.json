    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. clusii, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky habitats in Europe. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular addition to alpine and woodland gardens."
