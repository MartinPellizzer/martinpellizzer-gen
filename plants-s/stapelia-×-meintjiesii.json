    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 meintjiesii, commonly known as the Meintjiesii Stapelia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Stapelia \u00d7 meintjiesii is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
