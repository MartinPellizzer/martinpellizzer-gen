    "intro": "Stipa caragana, commonly known as the needlegrass or caragana grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa caragana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
