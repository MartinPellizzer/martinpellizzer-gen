These plants are native to the western United States and are characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stauranthus species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to thrive in arid conditions. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens and for their role in supporting local ecosystems."
