    "intro": "Sclerolaena biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered sclerolaena, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sclerolaena biflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
