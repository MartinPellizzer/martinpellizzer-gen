It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense stands. Sasa pseudokurilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
