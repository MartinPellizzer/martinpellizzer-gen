    "intro": "Stemmacantha nana, commonly known as the dwarf stemmacantha, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It features a short, upright stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically rounded and have a slightly hairy texture, aiding in water retention. Stemmacantha nana is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
