    "intro": "Searsia divaricata, commonly known as the silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some animals. Searsia divaricata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
