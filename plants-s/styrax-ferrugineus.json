    "intro": "Styrax ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive reddish-brown or rusty-colored underside. The plant produces small, hard, dark brown fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
