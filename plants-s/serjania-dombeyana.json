    "intro": "Serjania dombeyana, commonly known as the Brazilian angel's trumpets, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and produces woody capsules as its fruit. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly toucans and hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Serjania dombeyana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid, shaded environments."
