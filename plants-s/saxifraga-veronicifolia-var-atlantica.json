    "intro": "Saxifraga veronicifolia var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal cliffs and dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
