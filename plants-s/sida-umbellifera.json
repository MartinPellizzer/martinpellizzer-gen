    "intro": "Sida umbellifera, commonly known as the hairy sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which give it its species name. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that provide a distinctive texture. Sida umbellifera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and open woodlands."
