It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal bluffs. Its flowers are usually purple or pink and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
