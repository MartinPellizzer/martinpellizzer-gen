    "intro": "Silene dioica var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, though the variety 'glaberrima' is noted for being nearly hairless. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
