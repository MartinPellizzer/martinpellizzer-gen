    "intro": "Sphalanthus thorelii, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spherical seed pods. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphalanthus thorelii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
