It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
