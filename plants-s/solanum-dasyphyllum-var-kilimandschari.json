    "intro": "Solanum dasyphyllum var. kilimandschari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, and its leaves are ovate with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. These flowers give way to berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
