    "intro": "Stipa bicolor, commonly known as the pink feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green leaves and distinctive pinkish-red inflorescences that resemble feathers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, three-angled seeds that are dispersed by wind. Stipa bicolor is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
