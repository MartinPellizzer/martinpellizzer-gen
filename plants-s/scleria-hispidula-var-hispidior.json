    "intro": "Scleria hispidula var. hispidior, commonly known as the hairy umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features grass-like leaves that are typically hairy, especially along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its ornamental value is modest, but it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates."
