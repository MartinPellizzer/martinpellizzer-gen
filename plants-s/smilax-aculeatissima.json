    "intro": "Smilax aculeatissima, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and entangle other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Smilax aculeatissima is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
