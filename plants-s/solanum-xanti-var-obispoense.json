    "intro": "Solanum xanti var. obispoense, commonly known as the Obispo's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
