    "intro": "Serjania cirrhiflora, commonly known as the silky serjania, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, which give it its common name. Its flowers are yellowish-green and clustered in panicles, producing a distinct, aromatic scent. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds."
