    "intro": "Selaginella sanguinolenta var. brachyclada, commonly known as the red-stemmed spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its distinctive reddish stems that contrast with the green foliage. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
