It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, and it has a fibrous root system. Scrophularia alhagioides is often found in disturbed areas and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
