    "intro": "Stelis hians, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforest environments. The plant features a slender stem with a single, showy orchid-like flower that is usually white or pale pink in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis hians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded outdoor gardens."
