    "intro": "Symplocos iteophylla var. rostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked evergreen holly, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that often have a distinctive elongated tip. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warmer climates."
