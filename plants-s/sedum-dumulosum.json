    "intro": "Sedum dumulosum, commonly known as the cushion sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain water. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
