    "intro": "Siphocampylus superbus, commonly known as the giant white hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its large, waxy, white or pale green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
