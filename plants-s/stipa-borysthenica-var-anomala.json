    "intro": "Stipa borysthenica var. anomala, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It features slender, erect culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two to three florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid climates. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
