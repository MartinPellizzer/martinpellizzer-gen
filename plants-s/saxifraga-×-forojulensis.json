    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 forojulensis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions."
