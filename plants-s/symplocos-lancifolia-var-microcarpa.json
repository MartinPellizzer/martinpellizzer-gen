    "intro": "Symplocos lancifolia var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited evergreen holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
