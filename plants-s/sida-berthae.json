    "intro": "Sida berthae, commonly known as the Hawaiian sida, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. Sida berthae is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and is part of the Malvaceae family. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
