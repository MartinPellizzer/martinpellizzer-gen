It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its distinctive and often ephemeral floral displays. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that open only during specific times of the day, typically in response to temperature and humidity changes. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water in its harsh environment. Selago pterophylla is also noted for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and fascinating botanical specimen."
