    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera subsp. granatensis, commonly known as the granate saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant blooms with clusters of tiny, pink or red flowers that are typically arranged in a globular inflorescence, giving it its species name \"globulifera.\" It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
