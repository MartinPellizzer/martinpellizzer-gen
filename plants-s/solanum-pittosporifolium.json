    "intro": "Solanum pittosporifolium, commonly known as the Pittosporum-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, pittosporum-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and interesting fruit. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
