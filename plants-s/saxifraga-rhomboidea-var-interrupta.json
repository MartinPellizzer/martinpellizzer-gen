It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This species is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
