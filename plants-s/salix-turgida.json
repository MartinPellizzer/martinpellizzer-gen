    "intro": "Salix turgida, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are primarily pollinated by wind. Salix turgida is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
