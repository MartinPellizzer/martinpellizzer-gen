    "intro": "Salix kuznetzowii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a silvery-white bloom. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, arctic-like conditions. It is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and tundra environments. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
