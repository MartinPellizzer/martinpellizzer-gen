    "intro": "Stevia elongata var. typica, commonly known as the typical elongated stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red at the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing tiny, sweet-tasting leaves. These leaves are rich in steviol glycosides, making them a natural sweetener. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary use."
