    "intro": "Selaginella mortoniana, commonly known as the Morton's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the southeastern United States. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in capsules that are borne on short, erect stalks at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial mosses. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
