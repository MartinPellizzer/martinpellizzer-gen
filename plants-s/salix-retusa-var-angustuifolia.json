    "intro": "Salix retusa var. angustuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
