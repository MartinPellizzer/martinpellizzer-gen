It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often surrounded by specialized bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
