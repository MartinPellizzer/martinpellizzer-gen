    "intro": "Senecio dusenii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in open meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Senecio dusenii is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat, making it a resilient and specialized member of the local flora."
