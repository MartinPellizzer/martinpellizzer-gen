It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Smilax laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
