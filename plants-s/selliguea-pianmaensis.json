    "intro": "Selliguea pianmaensis, commonly known as the Pianma moss, is a rare and unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology, with leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are well-developed and contribute to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Selliguea pianmaensis is considered an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
