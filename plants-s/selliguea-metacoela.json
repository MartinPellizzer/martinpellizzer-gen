    "intro": "Selliguea metacoela, commonly known as the coastal rock fern, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments, particularly along rocky coastlines. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense mats. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Selliguea metacoela is often found in temperate regions where it can withstand salt spray and harsh weather conditions. Its ability to colonize rocky substrates makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
