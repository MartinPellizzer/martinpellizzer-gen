    "intro": "Securinega capuronii, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis myriocarpa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its unique, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its fruits are small, yellow-orange berries that mature in late summer, and they are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
