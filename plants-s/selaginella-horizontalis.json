    "intro": "Selaginella horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along its stems. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on specialized branches. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella horizontalis is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
