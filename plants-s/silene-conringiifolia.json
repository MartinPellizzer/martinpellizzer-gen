    "intro": "Silene conringiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its delicate, erect stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to cold and harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra habitats. Silene conringiifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
