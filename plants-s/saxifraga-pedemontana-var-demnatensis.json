    "intro": "Saxifraga pedemontana var. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps. It typically features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its rocky, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in crevices and on slopes. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Saxifraga pedemontana."
