    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare subsp. bicolor, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, clustered spikelets that produce edible grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop for arid regions. Its grains are used for food, animal feed, and even as a source of biofuel. The plant also has cultural significance in many parts of the world, particularly in traditional agriculture."
