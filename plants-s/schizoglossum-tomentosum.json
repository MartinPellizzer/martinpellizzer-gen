    "intro": "Schizoglossum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly tunicate, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a creeping stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which provide insulation and protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in a similar dense pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Schizoglossum tomentosum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
