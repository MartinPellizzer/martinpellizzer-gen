    "intro": "Sonneratia neglecta, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a small, evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has prop roots that extend into the water, aiding in its ability to anchor itself in soft, muddy substrates. Its small, white flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Sonneratia neglecta is also valued for its ability to tolerate saltwater, making it an essential component of coastal ecosystems."
