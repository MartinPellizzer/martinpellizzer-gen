    "intro": "Stipa iberica, commonly known as the Iberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are clustered along the stems, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa iberica is adapted to dry and poor soils, making it a resilient species in Mediterranean climates."
