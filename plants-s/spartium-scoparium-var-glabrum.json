    "intro": "Spartium scoparium var. glabrum, commonly known as whitehead clover, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrum is hairless. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
