It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. Smilax hirtellicaulis is often found in moist, wooded areas and can be invasive in certain regions."
