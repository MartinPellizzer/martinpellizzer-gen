    "intro": "Schomburgkia undulata var. moyobambae, commonly known as the Moyobamba orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous blooms, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and subtle color variations. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
