    "intro": "Sorbus minima, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries in the autumn. Its leaves are elliptical, with finely toothed margins, and turn yellow in the fall. Sorbus minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats."
