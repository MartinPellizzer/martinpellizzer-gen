    "intro": "Spilanthes lateraliflora, commonly known as the zigzag flower, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along creek banks. Spilanthes lateraliflora is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
