    "intro": "Saussurea gracilis, commonly known as the slender Chinese wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system and a tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a compound umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh alpine environment. Saussurea gracilis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
