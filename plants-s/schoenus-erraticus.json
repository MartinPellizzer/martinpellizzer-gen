    "intro": "Schoenus erraticus, commonly known as the erratic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Schoenus erraticus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
