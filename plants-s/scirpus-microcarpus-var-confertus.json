    "intro": "Scirpus microcarpus var. confertus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers that appear in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that helps it thrive in wet or flooded conditions. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, contributing to wetland vegetation structure and function."
