    "intro": "Stellaria uliginosa var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, temperate regions. It features small, white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are oblong and slightly hairy, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. It thrives in wet or damp soils, often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is closely related to other species in the Stellaria genus, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
