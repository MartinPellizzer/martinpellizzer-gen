    "intro": "Sedum californicum, commonly known as the California stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and can store water, helping it survive in arid conditions. Sedum californicum is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to attract pollinators."
