    "intro": "Scirpus amphibius, commonly known as the common marsh reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Scirpus amphibius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
