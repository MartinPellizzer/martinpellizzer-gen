    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland habitats. The broadleaf willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
