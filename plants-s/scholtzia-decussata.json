It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Scholtzia decussata is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats."
