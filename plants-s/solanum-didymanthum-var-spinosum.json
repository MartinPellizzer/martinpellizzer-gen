    "intro": "Solanum didymanthum var. spinosum, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and potential for invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated but requires careful management."
