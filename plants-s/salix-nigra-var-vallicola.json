    "intro": "Salix nigra var. vallicola, commonly known as the valley willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones."
