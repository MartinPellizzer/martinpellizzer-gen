    "intro": "Styphelia imbricata, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense, woolly layer of white or grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, sandy or rocky habitat. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia imbricata is often found in heathlands and is a characteristic component of the coastal flora of New South Wales and Victoria."
