    "intro": "Salix sarmentacea, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. Salix sarmentacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine organisms."
