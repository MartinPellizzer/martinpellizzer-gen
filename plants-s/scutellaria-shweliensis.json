It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its upright stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
