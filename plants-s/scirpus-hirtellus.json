    "intro": "Scirpus hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy environments. Scirpus hirtellus is often found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
