    "intro": "Selaginella pumilio, commonly known as the mossy spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form dense, moss-like mats on the forest floor. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are embedded in the leaf surfaces. Selaginella pumilio plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native ecosystems."
