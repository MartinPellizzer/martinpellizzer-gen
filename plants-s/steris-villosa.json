    "intro": "Steris villosa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Steris villosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
