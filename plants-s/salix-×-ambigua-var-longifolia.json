    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ambigua var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf willow, is a hybrid species within the willow family (Salicaceae). It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant is native to the wetlands and riparian zones of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability. The longleaf willow plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
