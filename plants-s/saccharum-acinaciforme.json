    "intro": "Saccharum acinaciforme, commonly known as the swordgrass or cane grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stem. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its fibrous stalks have been historically used for thatching and basket-making."
