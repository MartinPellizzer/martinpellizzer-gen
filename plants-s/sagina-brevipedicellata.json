    "intro": "Sagina brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry grasslands. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies."
