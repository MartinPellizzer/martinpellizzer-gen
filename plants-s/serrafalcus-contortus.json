    "intro": "Serrafalcus contortus, commonly known as the twisted leaf fern, is a unique tropical plant characterized by its intricately curled and twisted fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and exhibit a distinctive, spiraling pattern that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it grows as an epiphyte on trees. Due to its unusual appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and specialty collections."
