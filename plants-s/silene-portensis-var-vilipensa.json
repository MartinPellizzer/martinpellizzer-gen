    "intro": "Silene portensis var. vilipensa, commonly known as the Portentous blushing bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
