    "intro": "Shorea faguetiana, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
