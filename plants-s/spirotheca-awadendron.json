    "intro": "Spirotheca awadendron, commonly known as the desert spirea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
