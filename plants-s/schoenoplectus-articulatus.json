It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are often jointed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which appear in late summer. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Schoenoplectus articulatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
