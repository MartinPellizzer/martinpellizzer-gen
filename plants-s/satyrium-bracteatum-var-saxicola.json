    "intro": "Satyrium bracteatum var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spurred orchid flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
