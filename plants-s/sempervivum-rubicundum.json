    "intro": "Sempervivum rubicundum, commonly known as the red-flowered houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountains of southern Europe. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a reddish tinge, especially under direct sunlight. The plant produces vibrant red flowers in late spring or early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Sempervivum rubicundum is a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
