    "intro": "Salix scouleriana var. coetanea, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands. This variety is often distinguished from other Salix species by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
