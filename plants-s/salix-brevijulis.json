    "intro": "Salix brevijulis, commonly known as the short-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, spherical fruits called samaras. Salix brevijulis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
