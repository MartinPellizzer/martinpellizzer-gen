    "intro": "Sericolea decandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sericolea decandra is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth. Its hairy leaves and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its widespread distribution and ecological significance."
