    "intro": "Stenanthemum complicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in heathlands and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Stenanthemum complicatum is also known for its unique, ghost-like appearance, which gives it its common name."
