    "intro": "Sempervivum frutescens, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sempervivum frutescens is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which contribute to its hardy and long-lived nature."
