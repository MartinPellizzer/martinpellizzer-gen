It is characterized by its dense clusters of blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often fused at the base, giving it a distinctive perfoliata appearance. It is a hardy perennial that blooms from late spring to early autumn. Statice perfoliata is widely used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting flowers and ornamental value."
