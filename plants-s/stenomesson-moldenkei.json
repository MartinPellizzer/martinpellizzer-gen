It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Stenomesson moldenkei is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
