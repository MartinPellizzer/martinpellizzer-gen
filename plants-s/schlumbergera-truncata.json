    "intro": "Schlumbergera truncata, commonly known as the zebra cactus, is a popular epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, flat stems that resemble leaves, which are adapted for storing water. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the winter months. Its unique appearance and ability to bloom year-round make it a favored houseplant. Schlumbergera truncata requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
