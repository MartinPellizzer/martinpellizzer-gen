    "intro": "Sedum pallidum, commonly known as the pale stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular plant among gardeners in dry climates."
