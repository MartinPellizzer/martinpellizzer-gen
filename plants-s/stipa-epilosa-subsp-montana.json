    "intro": "Stipa epilosa subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect culms that often bear dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Stipa epilosa subsp. montana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
