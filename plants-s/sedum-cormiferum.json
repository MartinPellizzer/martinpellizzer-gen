    "intro": "Sedum cormiferum, commonly known as the cushion sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, compact clusters of fleshy, green leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil conditions. Sedum cormiferum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in harsh environments."
