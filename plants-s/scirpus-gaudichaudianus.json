It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Scirpus gaudichaudianus thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its robust growth makes it an important species for stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
