    "intro": "Solanum alternatopinnatum, commonly known as the alternate pinnate nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
