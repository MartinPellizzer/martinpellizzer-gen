    "intro": "Schmalhausenia echinopifolia, commonly known as the spiny-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Schmalhausenia echinopifolia is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments."
