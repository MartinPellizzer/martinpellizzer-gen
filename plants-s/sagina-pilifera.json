    "intro": "Sagina pilifera, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Sagina pilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
