    "intro": "Salvia filamentosa, commonly known as the threadleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces spikes of vibrant blue to violet flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia filamentosa is also valued for its aromatic foliage and can be grown in full sun to partial shade."
