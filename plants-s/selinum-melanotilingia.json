    "intro": "Selinum melanotilingia, commonly known as the black-stemmed selenium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its dark green foliage and distinctive, slender stems that often appear almost black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a dry climate, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
