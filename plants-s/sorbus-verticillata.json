    "intro": "Sorbus verticillata, commonly known as the clustered rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in whorls of three to five at each node. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
