    "intro": "Sambucus angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible when fully ripe, though they are often used in jams and wines. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. Sambucus angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
