    "intro": "Stipa lithophila, commonly known as the Lithophytic Needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant is adapted to rocky or sandy soils, thriving in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, spike-like flowers. Stipa lithophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance."
