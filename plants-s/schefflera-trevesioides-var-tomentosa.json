    "intro": "Schefflera trevesioides var. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
