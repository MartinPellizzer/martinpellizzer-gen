    "intro": "Saccharum officinarum var. litteratum-breve, commonly known as the dwarf sugar cane. This variant is a compact, low-growing form of sugarcane characterized by its shorter stature and dense foliage. It possesses thick, fibrous stalks that are less sugary compared to standard sugar cane varieties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of biofuel due to its high biomass yield."
