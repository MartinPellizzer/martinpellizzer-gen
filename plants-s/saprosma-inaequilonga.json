    "intro": "Saprosma inaequilonga, commonly known as the unequal-stemmed saprosma, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
