    "intro": "Sideritis arborescens var. lazari, commonly known as the Lazari ironwort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
