    "intro": "Sapium harrisii, commonly known as Harris's soap tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and unique floral structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. The bark is smooth and grayish, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
