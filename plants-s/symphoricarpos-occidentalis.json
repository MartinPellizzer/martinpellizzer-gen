    "intro": "Symphoricarpos occidentalis, commonly known as western snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The shrub thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions."
