    "intro": "Sedum rosea var. integrifolium, commonly known as the pink stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pink to reddish in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance gardens."
