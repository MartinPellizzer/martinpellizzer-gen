    "intro": "Strobilanthes blumeana, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure. Strobilanthes blumeana is also noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical gardens for its vibrant blooms."
