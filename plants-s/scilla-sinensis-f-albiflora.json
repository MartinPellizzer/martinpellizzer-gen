It is a perennial bulbous plant native to China, characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant, snow-like appearance during the flowering season."
