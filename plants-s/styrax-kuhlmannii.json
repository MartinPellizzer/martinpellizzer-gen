It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Styrax kuhlmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy floral display."
