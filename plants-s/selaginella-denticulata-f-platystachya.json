    "intro": "Selaginella denticulata f. platystachya, commonly known as the broad-stemmed spikemoss, is a fern ally belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This fern ally is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures."
