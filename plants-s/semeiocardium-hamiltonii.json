    "intro": "Semeiocardium hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers with a velvety texture and a distinctive heart-shaped lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
