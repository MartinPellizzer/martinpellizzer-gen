    "intro": "Selaginella oligophylla, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with closely packed, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. It produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of the stems, which release spores for reproduction. Selaginella oligophylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its unique adaptations to arid conditions."
