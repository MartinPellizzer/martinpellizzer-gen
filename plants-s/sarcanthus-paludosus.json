    "intro": "Sarcanthus paludosus, commonly known as the swamp spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and its cluster of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, often muddy soils, and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Sarcanthus paludosus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
