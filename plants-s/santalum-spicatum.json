    "intro": "Santalum spicatum, commonly known as the slender sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant is hemi-parasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. It typically grows in coastal and dry forest habitats, often forming dense thickets. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in spikes."
