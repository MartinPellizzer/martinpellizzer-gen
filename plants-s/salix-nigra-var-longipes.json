    "intro": "Salix nigra var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are the male flowers, and small, yellowish female flowers, both of which are clustered in separate inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The long-stemmed black willow is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
