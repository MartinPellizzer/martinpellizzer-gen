    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon subvar. petrophila, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh mountain climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
