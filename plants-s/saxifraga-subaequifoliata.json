    "intro": "Saxifraga subaequifoliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient species often found in mountainous landscapes."
