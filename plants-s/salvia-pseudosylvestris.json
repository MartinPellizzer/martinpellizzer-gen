    "intro": "Salvia pseudosylvestris, commonly known as autumn sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Autumn sage thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
