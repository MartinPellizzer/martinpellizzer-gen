    "intro": "Stapfochloa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Stapfochloa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
