    "intro": "Stellaria diversiflora var. gymnandra, commonly known as the starflower or mouse-ear grass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Its delicate appearance and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common sight in temperate regions."
