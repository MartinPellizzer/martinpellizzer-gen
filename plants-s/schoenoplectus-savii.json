    "intro": "Schoenoplectus savii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often form dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Schoenoplectus savii plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland environments."
