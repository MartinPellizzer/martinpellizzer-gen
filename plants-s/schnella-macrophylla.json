    "intro": "Schnella macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom of water bodies, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Schnella macrophylla plays an important ecological role by stabilizing water ecosystems and offering habitat for fish and invertebrates."
