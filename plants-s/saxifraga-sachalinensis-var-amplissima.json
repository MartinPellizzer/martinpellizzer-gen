    "intro": "Saxifraga sachalinensis var. amplissima, commonly known as the Sakhalin saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Far East of Russia and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with fleshy, basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and specific habitat requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
