    "intro": "Sarcochilus ceciliae var. roseus, commonly known as the Cecilia's sarcochilus, is a rare and striking orchid native to New Guinea. It is characterized by its vibrant rose-pink flowers and velvety green foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are known for their intricate, spurred structure. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
