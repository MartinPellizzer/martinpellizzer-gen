    "intro": "Salix grisophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine silvery down. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, giving the plant its common name, and they turn yellow in the autumn. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female flowers on separate plants. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
