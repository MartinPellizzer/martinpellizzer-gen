    "intro": "Scirpus tortilis, commonly known as the twisted bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, clustered inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Scirpus tortilis typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its flexible stems and dense growth habit make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
