    "intro": "Suttonia lanaiensis var. coriacea, commonly known as the Lanai velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience."
