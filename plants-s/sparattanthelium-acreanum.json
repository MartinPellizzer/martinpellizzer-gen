    "intro": "Sparattanthelium acreanum, commonly known as the Acrean Skygrass, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to harsh environmental conditions through a specialized root system that anchors it in rocky soil. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
