It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon, hence its common name. It is adapted to arid environments and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea nesiotica is often found in sandy soils and is an important plant for pollinators in desert ecosystems."
