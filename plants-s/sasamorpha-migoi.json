    "intro": "Sasamorpha migoi, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in the undergrowth of tropical forests. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sasamorpha migoi is considered critically endangered."
