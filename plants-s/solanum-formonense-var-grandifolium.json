    "intro": "Solanum formonense var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow when ripe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and landscapes."
