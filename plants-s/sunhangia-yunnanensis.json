    "intro": "Sunhangia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan sunhangia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
