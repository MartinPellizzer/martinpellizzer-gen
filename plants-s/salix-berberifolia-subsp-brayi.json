    "intro": "Salix berberifolia subsp. brayi, commonly known as the bray's willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy surface. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
