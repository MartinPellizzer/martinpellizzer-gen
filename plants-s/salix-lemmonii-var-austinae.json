    "intro": "Salix lemmonii var. austinae, commonly known as Austina's willow, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its flowers are catkin-like, appearing in early spring, and it produces small, cone-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
