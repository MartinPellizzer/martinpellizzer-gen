    "intro": "Solanum namaense, commonly known as the Namibian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by spherical berries that turn red when ripe. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branched. Solanum namaense is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often storing water in its thick leaves and stems."
