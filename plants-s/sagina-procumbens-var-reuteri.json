    "intro": "Sagina procumbens var. reuteri, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, arranged closely along the stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense carpets make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
