    "intro": "Solidago viscosa, commonly known as sticky goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Solidago viscosa is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
