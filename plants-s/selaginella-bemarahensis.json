    "intro": "Selaginella bemarahensis, commonly known as the Bemara spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor. Selaginella bemarahensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
