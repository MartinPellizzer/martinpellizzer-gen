It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other plants like mint and basil, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that are not typically showy but are important for its reproductive cycle.

Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular plant in both traditional and modern contexts."
