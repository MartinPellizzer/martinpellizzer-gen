    "intro": "Stipa setigera var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces airy, feathery plumes that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, with a bluish-gray hue, and the inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, wind-swaying appearance."
