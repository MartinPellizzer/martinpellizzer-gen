    "intro": "Santalum cognatum, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, and it is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats."
