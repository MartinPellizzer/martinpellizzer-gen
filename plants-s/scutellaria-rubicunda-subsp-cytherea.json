    "intro": "Scutellaria rubicunda subsp. cytherea, commonly known as the Cytherean skullcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern China. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters. Its tubular corolla is adapted for pollination by bees and other short-tongued insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to other Scutellaria species."
