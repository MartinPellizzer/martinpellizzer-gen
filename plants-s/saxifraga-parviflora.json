    "intro": "Saxifraga parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
