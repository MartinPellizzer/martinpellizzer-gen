    "intro": "Silene nocturna var. pauciflora, commonly known as the night-flowering catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats like sandy soils and disturbed areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
