    "intro": "Shepherdia rotundifolia, commonly known as roundedleaf hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk, which ripen in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Shepherdia rotundifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
