    "intro": "Siphonodon macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic life. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, which helps them stay afloat and resist decomposition. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a mild fragrance to attract pollinators. Siphonodon macrophyllus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by offering shelter and oxygen to aquatic organisms."
