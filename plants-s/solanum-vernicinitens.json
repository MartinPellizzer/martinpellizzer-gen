    "intro": "Solanum vernicinitens, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or purple. Its berries are usually yellow or orange when ripe and contain toxic alkaloids, making them harmful to humans and animals. The plant's sticky surface and defensive chemicals help it deter herbivores and survive in competitive environments."
