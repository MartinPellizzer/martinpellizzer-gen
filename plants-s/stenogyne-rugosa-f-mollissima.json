    "intro": "Stenogyne rugosa f. mollissima, commonly known as the soft-hairy stenogyne, is a rare and distinctive member of the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy, glandular leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It is native to Hawaii and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
