    "intro": "Schizodium arcuatum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often exhibit a zigzag or twisted appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Schizodium arcuatum is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
