    "intro": "Stewartia ovata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Chinese stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, elongated leaves that are dark green and glossy on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces showy white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are borne in clusters and attract pollinators. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive bark, which peels in thin, papery layers. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
