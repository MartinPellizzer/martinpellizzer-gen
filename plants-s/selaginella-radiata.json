    "intro": "Selaginella radiata, commonly known as the \"spikemoss,\" is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella radiata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
