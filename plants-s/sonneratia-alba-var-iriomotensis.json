    "intro": "Sonneratia alba var. iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote mangrove, is a rare variant of the white mangrove native to the Iriomote Islands in Japan. It is a halophytic plant, adapted to thrive in saline and brackish water environments, often found in coastal mangrove forests. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion, while its pneumatophores allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its white, waxy leaves reduce water loss and reflect sunlight, aiding in survival in high-salinity conditions. This variant plays a crucial ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
