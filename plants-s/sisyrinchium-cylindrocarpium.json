    "intro": "Sisyrinchium cylindrocarpium, commonly known as the narrow-fruit blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue-violet flowers with prominent yellow centers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments. Its flowers are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, and the fruit is a cylindrical capsule that splits open to release seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
