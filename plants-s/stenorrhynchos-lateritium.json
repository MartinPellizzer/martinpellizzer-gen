It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It has a short flowering period and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
