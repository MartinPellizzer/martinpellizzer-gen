    "intro": "Stegolepis parvipetala, commonly known as the small-petaled stegolepis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, and its leaves are typically pinnately divided with a distinctive, often fragrant aroma. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
