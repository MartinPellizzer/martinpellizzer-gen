    "intro": "Silene distachya, commonly known as the two-stamen grass violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces two stamens in each flower, a distinctive feature that gives it its scientific name. Silene distachya thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and unique floral structure make it a notable species in botanical studies."
