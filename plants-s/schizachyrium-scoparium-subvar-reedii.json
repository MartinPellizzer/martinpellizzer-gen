    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium subvar. reedii, commonly known as eastern reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
