    "intro": "Silene berdaui, commonly known as the Armenian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Silene berdaui has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
