    "intro": "Sarcochilus minimus, commonly known as the miniature sarcocarp, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and hairy, dark green leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale green to yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
