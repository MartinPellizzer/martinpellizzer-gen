    "intro": "Selaginella flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that often form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. Selaginella flexuosa is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it a common component of tropical and subtropical rainforests."
