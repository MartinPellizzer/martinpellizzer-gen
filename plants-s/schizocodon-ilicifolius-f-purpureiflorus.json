It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in such conditions."
