    "intro": "Stachytarpheta sanguinea var. hatschbachii, commonly known as the red-hat plant, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small, tubular flowers, which are typically white or pale pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is particularly noted for its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
