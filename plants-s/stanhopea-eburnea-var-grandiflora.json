It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly fragrant scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, helping it survive dry periods. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
