    "intro": "Spergularia rubra subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. The plant has a low, mat-forming growth habit, allowing it to thrive in harsh, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to Mediterranean and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy and resilient plant species."
