    "intro": "Stylophyllum virens subsp. extima, commonly known as the Emerald Green Sea Grasper, is a rare marine plant belonging to the family Halithyaceae. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and vibrant green coloration, which helps it thrive in shallow coastal waters. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and flexible, allowing it to sway with ocean currents. It plays a role in providing habitat for small marine organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
