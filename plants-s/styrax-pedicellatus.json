    "intro": "Styrax pedicellatus, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Styrax pedicellatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
