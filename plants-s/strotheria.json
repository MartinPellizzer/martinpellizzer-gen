    "intro": "Strotheria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Strotheria thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
