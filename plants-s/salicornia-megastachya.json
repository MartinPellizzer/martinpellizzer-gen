    "intro": "Salicornia megastachya, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a succulent shrub with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and brackish habitats. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in summer. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and the stems are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Salicornia megastachya is used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural salt in some regions."
