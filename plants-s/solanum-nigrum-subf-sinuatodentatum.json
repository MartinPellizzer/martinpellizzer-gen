    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subf. sinuatodentatum, commonly known as the narrow-toothed black nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, ovate leaves with serrated, sinuate margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically black when mature. It is native to regions of Asia, including China and India, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
