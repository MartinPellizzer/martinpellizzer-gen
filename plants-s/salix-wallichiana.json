    "intro": "Salix wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix wallichiana is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in gardens and parks in temperate regions."
