    "intro": "Stapelia longii, commonly known as the Long's Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers bloom in the spring and are designed to attract pollinators such as flies. Stapelia longii is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
