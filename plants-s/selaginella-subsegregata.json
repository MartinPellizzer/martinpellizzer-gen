    "intro": "Selaginella subsegregata, commonly known as the southern bottlebrush, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its clustered, bottle-shaped spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are often brightly colored. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces both spores and seeds, making it a unique example of a spore-bearing plant with reproductive versatility. Selaginella subsegregata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
