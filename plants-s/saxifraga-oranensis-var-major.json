    "intro": "Saxifraga oranensis var. major, commonly known as the Algerian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Algeria. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It is often found in high-altitude environments where it can tolerate harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
