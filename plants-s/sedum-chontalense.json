It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptability and low maintenance make it an attractive option for gardeners in dry climates."
