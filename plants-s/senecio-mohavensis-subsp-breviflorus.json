    "intro": "Senecio mohavensis subsp. breviflorus, commonly known as the Mohave groundsel, is a succulent shrub native to the Mojave Desert. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
