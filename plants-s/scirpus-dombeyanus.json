    "intro": "Scirpus dombeyanus, commonly known as Dombey's bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tint. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stem, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and is important for wetland ecosystems. Scirpus dombeyanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
