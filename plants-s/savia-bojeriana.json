    "intro": "Savia bojeriana, commonly known as the Bojer's spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often striking foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
