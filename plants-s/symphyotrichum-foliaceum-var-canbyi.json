    "intro": "Symphyotrichum foliaceum var. canbyi, commonly known as the Canby's Heath Aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered purple to pink flowers in the fall. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in association with other wetland plants. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Symphyotrichum foliaceum."
