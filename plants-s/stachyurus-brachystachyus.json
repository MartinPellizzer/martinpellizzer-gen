    "intro": "Stachyurus brachystachyus, commonly known as the Chinese fringeflower, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are often tinged with red. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and unique floral display."
