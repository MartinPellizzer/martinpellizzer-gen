    "intro": "Sida rubromarginata, commonly known as red-margin sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species belonging to the Malvaceae family. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with red-tinged margins, which give it its common name. Its small, five-petaled flowers are typically pale pink to white in color. Sida rubromarginata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
