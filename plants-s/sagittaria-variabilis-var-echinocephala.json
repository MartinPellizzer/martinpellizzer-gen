    "intro": "Sagittaria variabilis var. echinocephala, commonly known as the spiky arrowhead, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark, spherical berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable wetland environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
