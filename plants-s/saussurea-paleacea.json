It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.
