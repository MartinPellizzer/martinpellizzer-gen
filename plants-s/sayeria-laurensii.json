    "intro": "Sayeria laurensii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries. Its latex sap is milky and has been used traditionally for various purposes. Sayeria laurensii is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
