    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. ambigua, commonly known as the swamp betony, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of small, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wet environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
