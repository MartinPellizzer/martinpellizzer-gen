    "intro": "Secale cereale var. compositum, commonly known as composite rye, is a variant of rye that exhibits a unique combination of traits from different species. It is characterized by its intermediate morphology, showing features that blend those of rye and other grasses such as wheat or barley. This hybrid nature often results in a more robust growth habit and increased adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant typically produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed florets. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for agricultural use and genetic research due to its hybrid characteristics."
