    "intro": "Solanum geissei, commonly known as the Ecuadorean nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Ecuador and is typically found in humid, tropical lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant contains toxic compounds typical of the Solanum genus. Due to its restricted habitat and limited study, Solanum geissei remains a relatively obscure species within the Solanaceae family."
