    "intro": "Stipa tremula, commonly known as trembling grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa tremula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
