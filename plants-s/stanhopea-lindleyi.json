    "intro": "Stanhopea lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil. Stanhopea lindleyi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
