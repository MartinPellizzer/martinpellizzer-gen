    "intro": "Selenicereus kunthianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting moths for pollination. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in warm, dry climates with well-draining soil. The species is often cultivated for its striking floral display and nocturnal blooming habit."
