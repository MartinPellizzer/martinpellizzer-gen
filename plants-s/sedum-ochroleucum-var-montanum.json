    "intro": "Sedum ochroleucum var. montanum, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its resilience to cold temperatures allows it to survive in high-altitude ecosystems."
