    "intro": "Sageretia lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's sageretia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Sageretia lehmannii is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments."
