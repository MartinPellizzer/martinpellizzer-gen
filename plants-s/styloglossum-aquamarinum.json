    "intro": "Styloglossum aquamarinum, commonly known as the aquamarine ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent blue-green petals that resemble the color of aquamarine, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces delicate, elongated flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
