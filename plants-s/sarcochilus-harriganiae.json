    "intro": "Sarcochilus harriganiae, commonly known as the Harrigan's sarcochilus, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to New Zealand. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. It has a short flowering period, usually in late winter to early spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
