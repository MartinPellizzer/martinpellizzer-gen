It is characterized by its cylindrical, hollow stems that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize muddy soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus afflatus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
