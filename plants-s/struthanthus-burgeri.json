    "intro": "Struthanthus burgeri, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Struthanthus burgeri is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
