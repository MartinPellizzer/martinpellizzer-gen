    "intro": "Silene andicola, commonly known as the Andes silene, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in the harsh, cold environment. Silene andicola is also known for its medicinal properties, used traditionally by local communities for its healing benefits."
