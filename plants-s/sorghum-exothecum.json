    "intro": "Sorghum exothecum, commonly known as the outer protective layer of the sorghum seed, is a specialized structure composed of lignified cells. It serves as a barrier against environmental stressors and pathogens, contributing to the seed's durability. The exothecum is part of the pericarp, which develops from the outermost layer of the ovary. It plays a crucial role in the dispersal and germination process of the sorghum plant. Its thick, fibrous nature provides structural support and aids in water retention."
