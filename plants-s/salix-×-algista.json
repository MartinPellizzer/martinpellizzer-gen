    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 algista, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, which is particularly striking during the spring when it produces catkins. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Salix \u00d7 algista is widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued for its role in stabilizing riverbanks and improving water quality."
