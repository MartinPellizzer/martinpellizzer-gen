    "intro": "Swartzia submarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with stipules, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes. Swartzia submarginata is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
