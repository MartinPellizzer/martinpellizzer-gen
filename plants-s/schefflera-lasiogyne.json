    "intro": "Schefflera lasiogyne, commonly known as the glossy leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to pets. Schefflera lasiogyne thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
