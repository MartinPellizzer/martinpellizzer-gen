    "intro": "Scutellaria neubaueri, commonly known as Neubauer's bluehead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland borders. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
