    "intro": "Solanum quinquelobatum, commonly known as the five-lobed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are typically lobed, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid ingestion or contact with its berries."
