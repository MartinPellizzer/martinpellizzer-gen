    "intro": "Sorghum giganteum, commonly known as giant sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to Africa. It can grow up to 6 meters in height, featuring wide, lance-shaped leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically red or purple in color. It thrives in warm climates and is adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient species. Its fibrous stalks are used for forage, construction, and even as a source of biofuel."
