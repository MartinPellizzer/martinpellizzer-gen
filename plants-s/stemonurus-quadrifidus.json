It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with four distinct veins that give it its common name. Stemonurus quadrifidus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
