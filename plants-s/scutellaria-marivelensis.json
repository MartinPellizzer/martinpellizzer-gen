    "intro": "Scutellaria marivelensis, commonly known as the Marivel's skullcap, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scutellaria marivelensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
