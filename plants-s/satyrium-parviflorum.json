    "intro": "Satyrium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with two opposite leaves near the base. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and often lack a visible lip, which is a characteristic feature of some orchid species. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its unique symbiotic relationships in its ecosystem."
