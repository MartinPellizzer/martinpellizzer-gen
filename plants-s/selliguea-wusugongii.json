It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct lobes and a well-developed central axis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
