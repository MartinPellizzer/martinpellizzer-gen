    "intro": "Spergula heldreichii, commonly known as Heldreich's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the Balkan region and thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in mountainous areas. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Spergula heldreichii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance."
