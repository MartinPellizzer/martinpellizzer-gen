    "intro": "Scirpus wichurae f. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush genus Scirpus. It is characterized by its cylindrical, somewhat narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. This plant is native to wetland environments and thrives in shallow water or moist soil conditions. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually clustered at the top of the plant, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
