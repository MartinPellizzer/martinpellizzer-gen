    "intro": "Seriola rubescens, commonly known as the red snapper, is a marine fish species belonging to the family Serranidae. It is characterized by its streamlined body, which is well adapted for swift swimming in open waters. The fish typically has a reddish hue on its sides and a lighter color on its belly, which helps it blend into its marine environment. Its dorsal and anal fins are long and pointed, aiding in maneuverability. Seriola rubescens is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans."
