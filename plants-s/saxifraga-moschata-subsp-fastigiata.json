    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata subsp. fastigiata, commonly known as the fragrant saxifrage, is a perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. It features upright, narrowly elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
