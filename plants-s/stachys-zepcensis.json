    "intro": "Stachys zepcensis, commonly known as the Zepcensis betony, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
