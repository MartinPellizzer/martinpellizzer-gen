It is characterized by its unique, spiky, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small candles, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and conservation areas."
