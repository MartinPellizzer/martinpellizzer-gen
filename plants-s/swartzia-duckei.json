    "intro": "Swartzia duckei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody pod containing several seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
