It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, while its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Swertia montana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
