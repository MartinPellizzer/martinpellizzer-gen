    "intro": "Swida californica, commonly known as California snowberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Swida californica typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
