    "intro": "Stipa gigantea var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the giant feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and dune environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with the inflorescence consisting of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
