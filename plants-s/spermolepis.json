    "intro": "Spermolepis, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where they typically grow in dry, rocky habitats. Spermolepis species are characterized by their showy yellow or golden composite flowers, which are made up of numerous small florets. The leaves are usually narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and the plants are generally shrubs or small trees. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and are valued for their ornamental qualities in gardens."
