    "intro": "Sarcochilus societatis, commonly known as the Society's sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip, which attracts pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
