    "intro": "Sanicula menziesii var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem sanicula, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its smooth, often hairless stems and small, greenish-white flowers are distinguishing features. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its limited distribution and ecological niche."
