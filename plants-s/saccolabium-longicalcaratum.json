    "intro": "Saccolabium longicalcaratum, commonly known as the long-spined milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry environments. Saccolabium longicalcaratum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
