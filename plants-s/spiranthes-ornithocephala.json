It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowers are white to pale green and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable environments."
