    "intro": "Sarracenia psittacina f. luteoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green pitcher plant, is a unique variant of the green pitcher plant. It is characterized by its bright yellow to greenish-red pitchers that are often covered in fine, translucent hairs. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida, where it thrives in acidic, wet soils. Its pitchers are designed to trap insects, which are then digested by the plant to provide nutrients. This cultivar is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in bog gardens or specialized greenhouse environments."
