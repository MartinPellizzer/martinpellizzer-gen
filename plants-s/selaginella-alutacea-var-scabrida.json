    "intro": "Selaginella alutacea var. scabrida, commonly known as the scaly spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and rocky environments. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves, which are typically grayish-white due to a dense covering of trichomes. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the upper stem, which are protected by leaf-like structures called sporophylls. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a thick cuticle and the ability to enter dormancy. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appearance in xeriscaped gardens."
