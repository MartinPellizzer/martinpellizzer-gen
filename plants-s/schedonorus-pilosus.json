    "intro": "Schedonorus pilosus, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Schedonorus pilosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
