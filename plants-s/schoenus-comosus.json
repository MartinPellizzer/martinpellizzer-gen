    "intro": "Schoenus comosus, commonly known as the tufted bulrush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in wetland environments. Schoenus comosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
