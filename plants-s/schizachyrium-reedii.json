    "intro": "Schizachyrium reedii, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to purplish in color, adding visual interest during the growing season. Little bluestem is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects. It is a warm-season grass that enters a dormant state during the winter months."
