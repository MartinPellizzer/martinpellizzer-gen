    "intro": "Schismatoglottis modesta, commonly known as the modest schismatoglottis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyclanthaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often emerging from the base of the leaves. Schismatoglottis modesta is a rhizomatous plant, meaning it spreads through underground stems, making it suitable for cultivation in shaded, moist environments."
