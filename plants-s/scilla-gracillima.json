It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. Scilla gracillima is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
