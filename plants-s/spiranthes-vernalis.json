    "intro": "Spiranthes vernalis, commonly known as the spring spiral, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while the inflorescence consists of numerous small, white or greenish flowers. Spiranthes vernalis plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
