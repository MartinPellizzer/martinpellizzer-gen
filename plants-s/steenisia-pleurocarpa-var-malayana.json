    "intro": "Steenisia pleurocarpa var. malayana, commonly known as the Malayan steenisia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
