    "intro": "Stipa pulcherrima f. nudicostata, commonly known as the naked-costate feather grass, is a compact, tufted grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are typically a soft green, with a distinctive lack of leaf sheath ribs, giving it its \"nudicostata\" designation. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant appearance and low maintenance requirements."
