    "intro": "Selaginella beitelii, commonly known as the Beitel's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest floors. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, contain sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Selaginella beitelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
