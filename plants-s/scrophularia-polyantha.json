It features erect, branched stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Scrophularia polyantha is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
