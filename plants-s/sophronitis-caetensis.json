    "intro": "Sophronitis caetensis, commonly known as the Cattleya-like orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike bearing several flowers, each with a complex structure of sepals and petals. Sophronitis caetensis is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
