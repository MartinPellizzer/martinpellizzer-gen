    "intro": "Sophora perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often described as having a \"perfoliate\" arrangement, where the leaves appear to pass through the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing flat, oval seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Sophora perfoliata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
