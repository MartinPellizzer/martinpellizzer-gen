    "intro": "Silenanthe zawadzkii, commonly known as the Zawadzki's silena, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many diverse and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Silenanthe zawadzkii is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
