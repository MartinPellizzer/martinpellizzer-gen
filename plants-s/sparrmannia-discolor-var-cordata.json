It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in terminal panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical interest lies in its unique leaf morphology and its role in supporting local insect populations."
