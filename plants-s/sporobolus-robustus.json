    "intro": "Sporobolus robustus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, compact growth habit, which makes it well adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands. Sporobolus robustus is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
