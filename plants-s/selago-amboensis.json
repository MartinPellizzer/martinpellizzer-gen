    "intro": "Selago amboensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star grass, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Selago amboensis is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions."
