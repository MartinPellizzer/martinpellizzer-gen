It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found growing along shorelines and cliffs. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers clustered in spikes. Its fibrous stems and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Sida parietarifolia is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, making it a resilient species in its habitat."
