    "intro": "Symplocos macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a whitish, waxy coating. Its showy, white to pinkish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by large, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos macrocarpa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as along stream banks and in woodland edges."
