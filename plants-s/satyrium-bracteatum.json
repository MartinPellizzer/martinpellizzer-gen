    "intro": "Satyrium bracteatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, broad leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near water sources such as rivers or swamps. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The botanical features of Satyrium bracteatum make it a unique and visually appealing member of the orchid family."
