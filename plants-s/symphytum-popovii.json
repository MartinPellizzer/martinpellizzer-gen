    "intro": "Symphytum popovii, commonly known as the Armenian comfrey, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall spikes of purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are rich in allantoin, making it useful in traditional herbal medicine. However, due to its potential toxicity, it should be handled with care."
