    "intro": "Salix hastata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, and it is often found along stream banks and in moist soils. Salix hastata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its ecological importance makes it a key component of riparian ecosystems."
