    "intro": "Sorghum glabriusculum, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a native perennial grass of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for dryland ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in restoration projects. The plant's seeds are edible and have been utilized by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
