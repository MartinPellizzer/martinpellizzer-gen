    "intro": "Solenidiopsis galianoi, commonly known as the Galiano's solenidiopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, specifically the island of Hispaniola, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has hairy foliage and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Solenidiopsis galianoi is considered a rare and endangered species."
