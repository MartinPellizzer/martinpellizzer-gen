It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmate with multiple lobes radiating from a central point. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
