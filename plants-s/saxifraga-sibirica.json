    "intro": "Saxifraga sibirica, commonly known as Siberian saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a raceme. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga sibirica is adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
