    "intro": "Soldanella minima, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
