It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smooth and bright green during the growing season. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
