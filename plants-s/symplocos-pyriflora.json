It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing before the leaves in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds.
