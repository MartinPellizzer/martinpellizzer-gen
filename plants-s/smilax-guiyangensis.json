    "intro": "Smilax guiyangensis, commonly known as the Guiyang smilax, is a climbing shrub native to China, particularly found in the Guangxi and Guizhou provinces. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
