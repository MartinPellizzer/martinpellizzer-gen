    "intro": "Sida kohautiana var. corchorifolia, commonly known as the cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread through wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
