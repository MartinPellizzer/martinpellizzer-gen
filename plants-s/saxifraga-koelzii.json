    "intro": "Saxifraga koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is known for its frost-resistant properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
