    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos ceracifolium, commonly known as the waxy-leafed stenorrhynchos, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its typically humid and shaded habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is a member of the ginger family, known for its aromatic rhizomes and ornamental value in certain horticultural settings. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range."
