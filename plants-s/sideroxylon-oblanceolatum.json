    "intro": "Sideroxylon oblanceolatum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to oblanceolate in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
