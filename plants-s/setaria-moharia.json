    "intro": "Setaria moharia, commonly known as Mohari grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
