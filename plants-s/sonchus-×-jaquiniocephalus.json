    "intro": "Sonchus \u00d7 jaquiniocephalus, commonly known as the hybrid sunflower weed, is a composite plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a vigorous annual herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
