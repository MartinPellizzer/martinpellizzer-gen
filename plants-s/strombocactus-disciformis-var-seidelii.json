    "intro": "Strombocactus disciformis var. seidelii, commonly known as the Seidel's disc cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with a distinctive, flattened, disc-like shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its dense, woolly covering provides insulation and protection from harsh environmental conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
