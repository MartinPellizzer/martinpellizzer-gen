    "intro": "Statice albida, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Atlantic. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and spikes of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice albida is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
