    "intro": "Soldanella montana var. clusii, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, sunny conditions and limited nutrient availability."
