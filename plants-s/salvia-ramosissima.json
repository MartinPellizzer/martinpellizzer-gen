It features gray-green, aromatic leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and red, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
