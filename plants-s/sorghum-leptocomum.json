    "intro": "Sorghum leptocomum, commonly known as slender sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy crop in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, while its roots are deep and drought-resistant. Sorghum leptocomum is primarily grown for its grain, which is used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
