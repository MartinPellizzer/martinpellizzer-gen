    "intro": "Surenus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to the northern hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and umbellate inflorescences with small, often greenish or white flowers. Surenus species are typically perennial herbs that thrive in moist, shaded environments. Some species have been used historically in traditional medicine, though they contain toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
