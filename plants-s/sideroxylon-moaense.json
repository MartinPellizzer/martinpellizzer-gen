    "intro": "Sideroxylon moaense, commonly known as the Maori ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland forest areas, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Sideroxylon moaense is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
