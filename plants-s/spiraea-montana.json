    "intro": "Spiraea montana, commonly known as mountain spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring multiple stems that are often arching or weeping in appearance. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, usually from April to May. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraea montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
