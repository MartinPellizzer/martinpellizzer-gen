    "intro": "Steiropteris insignis, commonly known as the giant bamboo fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Steiropteris insignis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
