    "intro": "Sambucus sieboldiana var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping clusters of small white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution. Its leaves are compound, with 5 to 7 leaflets, and are often used in traditional medicine. The weeping elderberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators and providing food for birds."
