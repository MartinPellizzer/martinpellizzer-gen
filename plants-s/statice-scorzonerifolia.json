    "intro": "Statice scorzonerifolia, commonly known as sea lavender or saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its foliage is gray-green and covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs. Statice scorzonerifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
