    "intro": "Solanum lepidotum var. lepidiochlamys, commonly known as the purple potato, is a variant of the Andean potato species native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive violet to purple skin and white to yellow flesh, which gives it a unique appearance and flavor profile. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with stoloniferous growth, producing tubers that are typically harvested after the foliage has died back. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent rot. Due to its ornamental value and culinary versatility, it is cultivated both for food and as a garden plant."
