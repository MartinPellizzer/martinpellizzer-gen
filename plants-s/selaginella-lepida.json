    "intro": "Selaginella lepida, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are often spirally arranged around the stem. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella lepida is a vascular plant that possesses both roots and leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in diverse habitats make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
