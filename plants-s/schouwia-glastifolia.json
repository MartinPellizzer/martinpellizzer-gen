    "intro": "Schouwia glastifolia, commonly known as the glass-leaved schouwia, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family, native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that give it its common name, and its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or shaded habitats. It is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Schouwia glastifolia is also known for its ability to produce offsets, making it a desirable plant for propagation."
