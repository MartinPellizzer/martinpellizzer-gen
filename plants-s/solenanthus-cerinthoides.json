    "intro": "Solenanthus cerinthoides, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Solenanthus cerinthoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
