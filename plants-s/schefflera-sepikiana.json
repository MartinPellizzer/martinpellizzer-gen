    "intro": "Schefflera sepikiana, commonly known as the Sepik schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Sepik River region of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Schefflera sepikiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings outside its native range."
