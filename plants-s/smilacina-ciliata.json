    "intro": "Smilacina ciliata, commonly known as the southern smilacina, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, climbing stems that often trail along the ground or ascend through dense vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped with finely toothed margins, and it bears yellowish berries that mature in the fall. Smilacina ciliata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks."
