    "intro": "Scorpiurus sulcatus subsp. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth scurvygrass, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and have a smooth surface, which distinguishes it from other subspecies. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils along coastal areas and in salt marshes. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal vegetation and a subject of study in plant ecology."
