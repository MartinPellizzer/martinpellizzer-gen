    "intro": "Staurogyne spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water clover, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float or root in shallow water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshes. Staurogyne spatulata is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
