    "intro": "Sciaphila boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin shade plant, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant features a short rhizome with a few leaves that are elliptical and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a spike, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
