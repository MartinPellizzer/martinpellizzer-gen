    "intro": "Stenocline inuloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf inulin, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows as a perennial shrub with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in yellow or white, and bloom during the rainy season. Stenocline inuloides is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought."
