    "intro": "Sagina cerastioides, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or along pathways. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a common ornamental and groundcover plant."
