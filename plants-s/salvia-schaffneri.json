    "intro": "Salvia schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy textures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia schaffneri is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
