It has slender, branched stems that often bear small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its morphology makes it well adapted for life in aquatic habitats, contributing to water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
