    "intro": "Senna rigida var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth senna, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in pairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in small, flat pods that split open when mature. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry environments."
