    "intro": "Salix kusnetzowii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other aquatic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in northern climates."
