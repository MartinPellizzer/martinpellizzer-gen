It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
