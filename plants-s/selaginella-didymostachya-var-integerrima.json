    "intro": "Selaginella didymostachya var. integerrima, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a small, low-growing fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a dense rosette of needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, that contain spores, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it an interesting subject for studying plant survival in harsh environments."
