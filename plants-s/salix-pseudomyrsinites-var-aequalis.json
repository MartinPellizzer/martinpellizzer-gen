    "intro": "Salix pseudomyrsinites var. aequalis, commonly known as the equal-leaf willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the branches. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
