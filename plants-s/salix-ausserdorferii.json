    "intro": "Salix ausserdorferii, commonly known as the Austrian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female respectively, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
