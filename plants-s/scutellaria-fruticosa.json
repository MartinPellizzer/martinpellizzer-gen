    "intro": "Scutellaria fruticosa, commonly known as blue skullcap, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Scutellaria fruticosa is often found in moist to wet habitats, including swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
