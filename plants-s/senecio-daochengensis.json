    "intro": "Senecio daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Tibetan region of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows at high altitudes, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
