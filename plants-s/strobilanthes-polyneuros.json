    "intro": "Strobilanthes polyneuros, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple inflorescence, which resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, growing on the trunks and branches of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and its low population numbers, Strobilanthes polyneuros is considered critically endangered."
