    "intro": "Sarcosiphon hillii, commonly known as the New Zealand sea holly, is a marine plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Fucaceae and is characterized by its branching, ribbon-like blades that are often covered in small, rounded bumps. The plant typically grows in shallow, rocky intertidal zones where it can withstand wave action and salt spray. Its structure allows it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding water, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Sarcosiphon hillii plays a role in providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
