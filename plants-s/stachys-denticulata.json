    "intro": "Stachys denticulata, commonly known as the toothed hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Stachys denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
