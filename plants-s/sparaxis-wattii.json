    "intro": "Sparaxis wattii, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces striking clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive dry periods. Sparaxis wattii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
