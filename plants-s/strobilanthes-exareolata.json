    "intro": "Strobilanthes exareolata, commonly known as the \"Kampot strobilanthes,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Cambodia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Strobilanthes exareolata is known for its brief blooming period, which occurs during the rainy season, making it a rare and sought-after species among botanists and plant enthusiasts."
