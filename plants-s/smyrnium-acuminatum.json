    "intro": "Smyrnium acuminatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowbane, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-shaped inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
