    "intro": "Scobinaria japurensis, commonly known as the Japur\u00e9 cactus, is a rare species of cactus native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are typically green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Scobinaria japurensis is adapted to the humid and warm conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
