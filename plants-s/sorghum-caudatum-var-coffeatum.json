    "intro": "Sorghum caudatum var. coffeatum, commonly known as the coffee sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species native to Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, coffee-colored bracts that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall, herbaceous annual with a robust stem and narrow leaves. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for grain production. The unique coloration of its inflorescence makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
