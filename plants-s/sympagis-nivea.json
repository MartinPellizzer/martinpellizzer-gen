    "intro": "Sympagis nivea, commonly known as the white sympagis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sympagis nivea is considered a vulnerable species."
