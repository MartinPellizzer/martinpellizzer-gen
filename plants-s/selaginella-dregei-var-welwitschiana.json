    "intro": "Selaginella dregei var. welwitschiana, commonly known as the Welwitsch's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, herbaceous growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, which are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature common in many mosses and ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
