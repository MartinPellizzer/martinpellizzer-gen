    "intro": "Spodiopogon arcuatus, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
