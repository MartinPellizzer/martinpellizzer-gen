    "intro": "Salvia eriophora, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and showy violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes. Salvia eriophora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
