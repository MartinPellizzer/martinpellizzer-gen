    "intro": "Selaginella andrewsii, commonly known as the Texas spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing plant with a rosette of needle-like leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. Native to the southwestern United States, it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it highly resilient to drought conditions. Its morphology and reproductive structures are characteristic of the spore-producing plants in the order Selaginellales."
