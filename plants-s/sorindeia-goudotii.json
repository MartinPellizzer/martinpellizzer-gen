    "intro": "Sorindeia goudotii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its scent and durability. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by capsule fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Sorindeia goudotii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
