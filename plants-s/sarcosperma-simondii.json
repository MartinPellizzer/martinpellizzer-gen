It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
