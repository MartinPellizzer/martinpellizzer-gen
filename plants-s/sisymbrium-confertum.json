    "intro": "Sisymbrium confertum, commonly known as clustered shepherd's purse, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of four-petaled yellow flowers. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated silique that splits open to release seeds. It often grows in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
