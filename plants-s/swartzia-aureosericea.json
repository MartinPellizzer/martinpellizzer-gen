    "intro": "Swartzia aureosericea, commonly known as golden featherwood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental leaves, which are bipinnate and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding to its visual appeal. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after material in furniture and cabinetry. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
