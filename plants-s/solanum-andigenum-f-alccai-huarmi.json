    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. alccai-huarmi, commonly known as the Huarmi nightshade, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually hairy and elliptical, while its fruits are small berries that contain toxic compounds typical of the Solanum genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
