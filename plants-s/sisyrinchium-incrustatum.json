    "intro": "Sisyrinchium incrustatum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
