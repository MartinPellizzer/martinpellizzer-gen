    "intro": "Solanum paramoense, commonly known as the paramo nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of South America, specifically the paramo ecosystem. It is a shrub-like species that typically grows in cool, humid environments above the tree line. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, adapting to the short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in the cold, dry air. Solanum paramoense is part of the nightshade family, which includes many economically important plants, though it is not widely cultivated or used by humans."
