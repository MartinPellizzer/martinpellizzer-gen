    "intro": "Stemodia viscosa, commonly known as sticky stemodia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems that exude a sticky substance, which is a key botanical feature. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and often emits a mild, aromatic scent. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. The sticky secretions on its stems are believed to play a role in deterring herbivores and reducing water loss."
