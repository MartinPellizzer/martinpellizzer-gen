    "intro": "Sapindus capensis, commonly known as the African soap tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing hard seeds. Its most notable feature is the ability of its fruits to produce a soapy lather when crushed, making it useful for cleaning purposes. This plant is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
