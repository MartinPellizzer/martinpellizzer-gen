    "intro": "Solanum dillonii, commonly known as the Dillon's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans but are used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
