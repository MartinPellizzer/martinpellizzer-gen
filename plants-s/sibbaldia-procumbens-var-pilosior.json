    "intro": "Sibbaldia procumbens var. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink. The leaves are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh native habitat."
