    "intro": "Stelis ambrosia, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant features a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis ambrosia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique scent."
