It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
