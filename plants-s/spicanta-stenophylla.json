    "intro": "Spicanta stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels at the base of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its succulent-like appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for a cactus, but it is actually a member of the Euphorbiaceae family."
