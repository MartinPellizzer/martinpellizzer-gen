    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera subsp. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, ovate to spatulate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
