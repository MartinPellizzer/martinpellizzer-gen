    "intro": "Seseli tortuosum var. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal seseli, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
