    "intro": "Salix zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist habitats. Salix zeyheri is adapted to wet environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
