It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to cream in color, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.
