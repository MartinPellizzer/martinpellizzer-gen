    "intro": "Saussurea rohmooana, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellowish to brownish flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties, used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
