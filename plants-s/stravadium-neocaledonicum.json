    "intro": "Stravadium neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonia lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has strap-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected by local conservation efforts. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
