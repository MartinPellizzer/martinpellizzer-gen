    "intro": "Salsola atrata, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is an annual shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. Salsola atrata is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
