    "intro": "Setouratea lata, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Setouratea lata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
