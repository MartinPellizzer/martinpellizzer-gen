    "intro": "Salix lapponum, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet, sandy soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. The plant has slender, zigzagging stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Salix lapponum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and subarctic environments."
