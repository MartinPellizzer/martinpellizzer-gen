    "intro": "Sporobolus festivus var. dillonianus, commonly known as the Dillon's sand grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in dunes, plains, and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a valuable plant for erosion control."
