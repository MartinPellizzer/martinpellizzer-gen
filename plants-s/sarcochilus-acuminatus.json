    "intro": "Sarcochilus acuminatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, spurred lip that is typically darker in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or subcoastal regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some parts of its range."
