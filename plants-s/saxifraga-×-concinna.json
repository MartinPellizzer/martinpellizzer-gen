    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 concinna, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically succulent, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Saxifraga \u00d7 concinna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, garden settings."
