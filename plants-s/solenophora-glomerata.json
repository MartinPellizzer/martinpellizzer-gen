    "intro": "Solenophora glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its compact, floating growth habit and its ability to produce tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are short and often clustered, with specialized structures that aid in nutrient absorption. Solenophora glomerata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to the food web."
