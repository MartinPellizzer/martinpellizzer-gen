    "intro": "Stipa humilis var. jonesiana, commonly known as the Jones' needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more silvery with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
