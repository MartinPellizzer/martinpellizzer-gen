It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves with narrow, elongated lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into spherical berries, which are typically yellow when ripe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is often found in temperate regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
