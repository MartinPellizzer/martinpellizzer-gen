    "intro": "Scleropyrum, commonly known as the hard-fruit tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals and numerous stamens. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, often containing a single, hard seed. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils."
