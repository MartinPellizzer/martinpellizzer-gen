    "intro": "Solidago durangensis, commonly known as Durango goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its bright yellow inflorescences bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
