    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor f. platylopha, commonly known as the flat-leaf sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
