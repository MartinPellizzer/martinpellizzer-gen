    "intro": "Sphaeroma incanum, commonly known as the silver sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
