    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. tomentosa, commonly known as the white-awned whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by white, woolly fruits called pomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
