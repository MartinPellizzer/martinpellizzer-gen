    "intro": "Sphaeranthus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf globemallow, is a small annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and desert margins, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
