    "intro": "Stelis nemoralis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip that attracts pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices, while its leaves are narrow and succulent to store water. Stelis nemoralis is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
