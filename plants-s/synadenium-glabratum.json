    "intro": "Synadenium glabratum, commonly known as the naked stem milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to arid environments and has a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. Synadenium glabratum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
