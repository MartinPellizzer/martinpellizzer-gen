    "intro": "Syzygium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its bark is rough and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap. Syzygium microphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
