    "intro": "Sphaeralcea procera, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. Sphaeralcea procera is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
