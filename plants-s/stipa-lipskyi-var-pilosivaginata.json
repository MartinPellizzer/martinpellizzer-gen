    "intro": "Stipa lipskyi var. pilosivaginata, commonly known as the hairy sheath bluegrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are typically blue-green in color. This variety is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important plant in the study of grassland ecosystems."
