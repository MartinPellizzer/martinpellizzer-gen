    "intro": "Salix retusa f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form of Salix retusa. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
