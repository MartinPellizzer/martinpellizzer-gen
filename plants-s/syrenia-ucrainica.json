    "intro": "Syrenia ucrainica, commonly known as the Ukrainian syrenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Ukraine. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Syrenia ucrainica is considered a species of conservation concern."
