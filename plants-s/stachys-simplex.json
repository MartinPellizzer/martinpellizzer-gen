    "intro": "Stachys simplex, commonly known as slender betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces spikes of small, two-lipped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Stachys simplex is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
