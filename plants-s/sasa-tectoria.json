    "intro": "Sasa tectoria, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or roof bamboo, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant forms thick rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to create thickets in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its culms are hollow and jointed. Sasa tectoria is often used in horticulture for erosion control and as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
