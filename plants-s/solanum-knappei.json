    "intro": "Solanum knappei, commonly known as the Knappe's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves. Its fruits are berries that mature to a bright yellow or orange color, containing several seeds. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
