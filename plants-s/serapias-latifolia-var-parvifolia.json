    "intro": "Serapias latifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in damp, calcareous soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. This variety is characterized by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form of Serapias latifolia."
