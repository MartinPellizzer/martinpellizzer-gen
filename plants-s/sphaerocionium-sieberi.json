    "intro": "Sphaerocionium sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive rounded or globose thallus structure. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, particularly in temperate forest environments. The plant's vegetative body is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is characterized by its leathery, often bright green or yellowish-green coloration. Sphaerocionium sieberi is widely distributed across Asia and is often found in humid, shaded habitats."
