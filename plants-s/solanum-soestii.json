It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are a food source for certain birds and mammals. Solanum soestii is valued in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
