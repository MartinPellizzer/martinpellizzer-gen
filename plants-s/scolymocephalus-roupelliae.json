    "intro": "Scolymocephalus roupelliae, commonly known as the Roupell's scolymus, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
