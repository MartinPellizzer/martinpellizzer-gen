It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, low-growing habit. It produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that remain on the plant after flowering, aiding in seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to arid environments."
