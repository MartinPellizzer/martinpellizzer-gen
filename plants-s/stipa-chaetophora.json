    "intro": "Stipa chaetophora, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands. Stipa chaetophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
