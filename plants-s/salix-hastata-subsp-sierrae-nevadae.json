    "intro": "Salix hastata subsp. sierrae-nevadae, commonly known as Sierra Nevada willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in mountain meadows. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. This subspecies is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its alpine and subalpine habitats."
