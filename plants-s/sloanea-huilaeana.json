    "intro": "Sloanea huilaeana, commonly known as the Huilaeana Sloanea, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate, and elliptical leaves, which are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
