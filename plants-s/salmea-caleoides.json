    "intro": "Salmea caleoides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, followed by a rapid closing in the heat of the day. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Salmea caleoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
