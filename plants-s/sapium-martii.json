    "intro": "Sapium martii, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins. The tree produces woody fruits that split open to release fluffy seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Botanically, it belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its latex-producing species."
