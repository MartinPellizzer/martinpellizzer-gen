It is a herbaceous annual with small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. The plant has elliptical, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
