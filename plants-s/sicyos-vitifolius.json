    "intro": "Sicyos vitifolius, commonly known as the grape-leaf sicyos, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble grape leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its fruits are spherical, spiny berries that contain toxic seeds, making them unsuitable for consumption. Sicyos vitifolius is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
