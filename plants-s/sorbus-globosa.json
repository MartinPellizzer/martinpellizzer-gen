    "intro": "Sorbus globosa, commonly known as the globe willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, globe-like form and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated edge. Sorbus globosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
