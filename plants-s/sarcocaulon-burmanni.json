    "intro": "Sarcocaulon burmanni, commonly known as the Burmann's rock heath, is a small, perennial shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, evergreen foliage, which is often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Sarcocaulon burmanni is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist forest understories."
