    "intro": "Stylidium torticarpum, commonly known as the torticarpum devil's claw, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a member of the family Pedaliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces a unique structure called a sarcocarp, which is a fleshy, seed-containing capsule that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Stylidium torticarpum is known for its adaptive features that allow it to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
