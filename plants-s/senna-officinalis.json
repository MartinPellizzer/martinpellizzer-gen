    "intro": "Senna officinalis, commonly known as yellow senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods containing numerous seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Senna officinalis is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly its use as a laxative due to the presence of saponins and flavonoids. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth."
