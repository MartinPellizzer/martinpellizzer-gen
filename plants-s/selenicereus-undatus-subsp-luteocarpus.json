    "intro": "Selenicereus undatus subsp. luteocarpus, commonly known as the yellow-carpenter cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Central America. It is a climbing cactus that produces large, fragrant, night-blooming flowers with yellow petals and a strong, sweet scent. The plant has a segmented stem covered in white or green spines, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid tropical environment. It thrives in warm, moist conditions and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bats and moths, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
