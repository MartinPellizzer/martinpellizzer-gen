    "intro": "Salix nummularia var. cyclophylla, commonly known as the silver willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are covered in a silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways or in wet meadows. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
