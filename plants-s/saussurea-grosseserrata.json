    "intro": "Saussurea grosseserrata, commonly known as the Tibetan giant yellowflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stem and large, yellowish-green composite flower heads. The plant has finely serrated leaves that are adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its native habitat. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional Tibetan medicine."
