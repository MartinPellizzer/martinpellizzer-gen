    "intro": "Stelis globulifera, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, spurred lip that attracts pollinators."
