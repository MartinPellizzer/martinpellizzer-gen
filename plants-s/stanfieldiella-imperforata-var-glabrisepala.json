    "intro": "Stanfieldiella imperforata var. glabrisepala, commonly known as the smooth-sepaled sandalwood, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and durability, making it a sought-after resource in traditional crafts and medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
