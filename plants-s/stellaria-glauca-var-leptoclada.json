It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and thin, wiry stems. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is often found in moist soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
