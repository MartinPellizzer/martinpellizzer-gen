    "intro": "Selaginella borealis f. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen herb with needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its spore-producing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its sporophylls. Native to the northern regions of East Asia, it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
