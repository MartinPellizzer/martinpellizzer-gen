    "intro": "Syzygium apiarii, commonly known as the honeybee syzygium, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are small, round, and edible, often used in local cuisines for their sweet and aromatic flavor. Syzygium apiarii is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators, particularly honeybees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
