    "intro": "Sarcopodium lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's root or the ghost plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its underground tubers and its ability to form dense, creeping mats. The plant is native to parts of China and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its foliage is usually reduced, with only a few narrow leaves emerging from the tuber. Sarcopodium lyonii is notable for its unusual growth form and its use in traditional medicine."
