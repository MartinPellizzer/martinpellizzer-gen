    "intro": "Struthiola nana, commonly known as the dwarf struthiola, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Struthiola nana is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
