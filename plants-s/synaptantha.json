    "intro": "Synaptantha, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and their showy, umbel-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Synaptantha species are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance. They are typically found in woodland habitats and are known for their ornamental value in gardens."
