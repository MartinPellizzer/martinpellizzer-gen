    "intro": "Sedum rosea var. heterodontum, commonly known as the variegated stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically green with white or yellow margins, creating a striking variegated appearance. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late summer. Native to rocky and arid environments, this plant is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soils. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
