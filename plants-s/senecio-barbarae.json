    "intro": "Senecio barbarae, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is well adapted to dry conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio barbarae produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
