    "intro": "Scirpus pusillus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, cylindrical flower spikes are usually arranged in clusters and bloom in the late summer. Scirpus pusillus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
