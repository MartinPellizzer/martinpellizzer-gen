    "intro": "Sedum multicaule subsp. rugosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
