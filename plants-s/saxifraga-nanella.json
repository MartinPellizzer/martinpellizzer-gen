    "intro": "Saxifraga nanella, commonly known as the miniature saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, usually blooming in late summer. Saxifraga nanella thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its compact size and resilience make it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine settings."
