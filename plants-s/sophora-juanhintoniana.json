    "intro": "Sophora juanhintoniana, commonly known as the Juan Hinton's Sophora, is a rare and endangered leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered critically important for conservation efforts."
