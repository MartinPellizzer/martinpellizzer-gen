    "intro": "Saccolabium retrocallum, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Sicklepod, is a perennial shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, curved pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in revegetation projects in dryland areas."
