It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features yellow composite flowers with prominent, hairy, glandular structures on its stems and leaves. Its foliage is often covered in fine, reddish hairs, which give it its common name. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
