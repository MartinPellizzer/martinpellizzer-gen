    "intro": "Statice ulicina, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Statice ulicina is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
