    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. aflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered potato, is a variant of the common potato characterized by its striking red or purple flowers. This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. It produces tubers similar to the standard potato but with a more intense flavor and a slightly higher anthocyanin content. The flowers are typically showy and can be used in ornamental gardening. While primarily cultivated for its tubers, it is also appreciated for its aesthetic value in gardens."
