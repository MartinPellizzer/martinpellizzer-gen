    "intro": "Swartzia grandifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it can grow up to 30 meters tall in its natural habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
