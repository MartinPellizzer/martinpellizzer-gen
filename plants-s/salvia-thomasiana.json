    "intro": "Salvia thomasiana, commonly known as Thomas's sage, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Salvia thomasiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
