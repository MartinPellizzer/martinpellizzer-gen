    "intro": "Sporobolus elongatus var. purpureosuffusus, commonly known as the purple-veined needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves with distinctive purple veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat."
