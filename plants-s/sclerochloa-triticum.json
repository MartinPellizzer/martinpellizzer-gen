    "intro": "Sclerochloa triticum, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Sclerochloa triticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
