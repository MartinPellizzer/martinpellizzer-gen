    "intro": "Saxifraga lamottei var. diffusa, commonly known as the diffuse lamotte saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in a fine layer of white hair. This variant is distinguished by its more diffuse growth habit compared to the typical form of Saxifraga lamottei."
