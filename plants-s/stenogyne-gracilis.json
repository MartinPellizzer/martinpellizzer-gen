    "intro": "Stenogyne gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests and along stream banks. Stenogyne gracilis is a federally endangered species, with its limited distribution and habitat specificity making it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Its conservation status highlights the importance of protecting native Hawaiian flora."
