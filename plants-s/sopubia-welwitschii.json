    "intro": "Sopubia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is one of the oldest living seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, which are covered in a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in the arid environment. Sopubia welwitschii is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a remarkable example of desert flora."
