    "intro": "Saxifraga geranioides var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically broad, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny environments at high elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions."
