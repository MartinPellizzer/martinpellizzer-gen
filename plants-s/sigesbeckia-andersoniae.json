    "intro": "Sigesbeckia andersoniae, commonly known as the Andes buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Sigesbeckia andersoniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
