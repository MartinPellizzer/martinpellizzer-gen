It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
