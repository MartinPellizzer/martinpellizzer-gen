    "intro": "Stachys asterocalyx, commonly known as the star-leaved hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are square and hairy, a characteristic common among the mint family. Stachys asterocalyx is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
