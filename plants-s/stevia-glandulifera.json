    "intro": "Stevia glandulifera, commonly known as the sweet leaf plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in small, glandular structures. The plant produces small yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, capsule-like fruits containing tiny seeds. Stevia glandulifera is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. Due to its medicinal and sweetening properties, it has been used traditionally in South American cultures for centuries."
