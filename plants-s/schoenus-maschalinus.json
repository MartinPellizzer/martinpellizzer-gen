    "intro": "Schoenus maschalinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small flowering structures typical of the grass family. Schoenus maschalinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
