    "intro": "Saxifraga obovatipetala, commonly known as the broad-leafed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
