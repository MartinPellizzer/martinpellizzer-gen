    "intro": "Specklinia calderae, commonly known as the Caldera speckled orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the humid cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its compact, dark green leaves with distinctive white speckles, which help in photosynthesis under the dense canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
