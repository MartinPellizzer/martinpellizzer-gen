    "intro": "Sarcanthus tricornis, commonly known as the three-horned orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive tridentate (three-toothed) lip, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Sarcanthus tricornis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
