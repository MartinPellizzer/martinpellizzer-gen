    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum trollii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions in low light. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of large trees. Its unique morphology and elusive nature make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum trollii is considered a critically endangered species."
