It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many evergreen shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with serrated margins, which give it its varietal name. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests."
