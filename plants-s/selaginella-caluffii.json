    "intro": "Selaginella caluffii, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is native to regions of southern Africa. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among primitive vascular plants. Selaginella caluffii is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
