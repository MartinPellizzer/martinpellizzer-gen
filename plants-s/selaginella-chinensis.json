    "intro": "Selaginella chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves and a short, upright stem. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is characterized by the presence of strobila, which produce spores. Selaginella chinensis is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its use in traditional medicine in some Asian countries."
