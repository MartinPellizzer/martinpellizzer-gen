    "intro": "Senecio irgangii, commonly known as the Irgangii groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by papery, bract-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
