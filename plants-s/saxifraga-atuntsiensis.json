It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a perennial species that produces seed capsules following flowering. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant."
