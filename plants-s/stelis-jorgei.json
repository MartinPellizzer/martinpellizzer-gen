    "intro": "Stelis jorgei, commonly known as the Jorge's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically features compact, upright pseudobulbs with linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Stelis jorgei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare orchids."
