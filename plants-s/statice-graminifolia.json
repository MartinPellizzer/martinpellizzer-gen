    "intro": "Statice graminifolia, commonly known as sea lavender grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Statice graminifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
