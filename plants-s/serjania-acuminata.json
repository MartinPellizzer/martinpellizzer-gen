It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy appearance. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
