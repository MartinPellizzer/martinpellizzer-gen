    "intro": "Stipa horrifolia, commonly known as the hairy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa horrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
