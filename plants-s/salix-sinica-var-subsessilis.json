    "intro": "Salix sinica var. subsessilis, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, cascading appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-green underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated and precede the leaves."
