    "intro": "Sassia perdicaria, commonly known as the lesser saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Sassia perdicaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
