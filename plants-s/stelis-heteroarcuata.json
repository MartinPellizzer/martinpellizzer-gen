    "intro": "Stelis heteroarcuata, commonly known as the heteroarcuate stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and typically produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. The flowers usually bloom in spring or early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat."
