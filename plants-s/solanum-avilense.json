    "intro": "Solanum avilense, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Solanum avilense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous due to its toxic compounds."
