    "intro": "Salix korsakoviensis, commonly known as Korsakov's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gland-dotted. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
