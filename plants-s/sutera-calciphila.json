    "intro": "Sutera calciphila, commonly known as the limestone sutera, is a rare flowering plant native to southern Europe. It thrives in calcareous soils, typically found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Sutera calciphila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native range."
