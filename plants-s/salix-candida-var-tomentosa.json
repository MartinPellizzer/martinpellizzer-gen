    "intro": "Salix candida var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water bodies. Its growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation."
