    "intro": "Simocheilus quadrisulcus, commonly known as the four-ribbed water plant, is a aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive four longitudinal ribs on its leaf blades. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Simocheilus quadrisulcus plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and contributes to water quality by absorbing nutrients."
