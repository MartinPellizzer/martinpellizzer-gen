    "intro": "Seseli meum, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble the beard of a goat, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Seseli meum is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance to pollinators."
