    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 morelianum, commonly known as the Morelia houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with fleshy, thick leaves that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its hardy nature and ability to form offsets make it an easy-to-care-for plant for both novice and experienced gardeners."
