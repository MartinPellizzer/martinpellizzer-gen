    "intro": "Sagina sabuletorum var. loscosii, commonly known as the sand pearlweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of salt marshes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by tiny, bead-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid or saline conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
