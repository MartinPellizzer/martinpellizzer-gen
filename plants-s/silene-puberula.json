    "intro": "Silene puberula, commonly known as the downy catchfly, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Silene puberula is an annual or biennial species that plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and flies."
