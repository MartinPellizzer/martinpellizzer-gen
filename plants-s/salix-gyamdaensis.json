    "intro": "Salix gyamdaensis, commonly known as the Gyamda willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Salix gyamdaensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
