    "intro": "Stegolepis ptaritepuiensis, commonly known as the Piaroa mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often growing on limestone outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
