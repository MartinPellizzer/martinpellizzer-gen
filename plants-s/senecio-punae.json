    "intro": "Senecio punae, commonly known as the Puna Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow ray flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at high altitudes. It has small, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Senecio punae is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
