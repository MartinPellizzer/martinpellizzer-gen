    "intro": "Sorocea pubivena, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sorocea pubivena is often found in disturbed habitats such as agricultural fields and roadsides."
