    "intro": "Stevia crenata, commonly known as sweetleaf or sugarleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are highly aromatic and intensely sweet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stevia crenata is renowned for its natural sweetening properties, making it a popular alternative to sugar in various culinary and medicinal applications. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are responsible for its distinctive sweetness."
