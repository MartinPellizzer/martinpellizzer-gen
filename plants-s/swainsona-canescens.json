    "intro": "Swainsona canescens, commonly known as the white thorn or desert bean, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has thorny stems that provide protection from herbivores. Swainsona canescens is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
