    "intro": "Sorocea hilarii, commonly known as the Hilari's sorocea, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific microhabitats within its native region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are finely dissected, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that aids in light reflection. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sorocea hilarii is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
