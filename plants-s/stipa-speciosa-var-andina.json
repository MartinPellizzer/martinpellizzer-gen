    "intro": "Stipa speciosa var. andina, commonly known as the Andean feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine or rock garden environments. Its foliage is usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to add visual interest to garden landscapes."
