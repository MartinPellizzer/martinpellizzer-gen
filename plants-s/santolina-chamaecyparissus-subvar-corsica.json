    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subvar. corsica, commonly known as Corsican santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, aromatic foliage that is densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
