    "intro": "Styphelia viridis var. breviflora, commonly known as the green moor heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features small, bright green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
