    "intro": "Schefflera eucaudata, commonly known as the golden schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain black seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera eucaudata is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
