    "intro": "Stylocoryna nilagirica, commonly known as the Nilagiri sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and incense. The plant has small, alternate, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
