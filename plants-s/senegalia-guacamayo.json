    "intro": "Senegalia guacamayo, commonly known as the yellow brush or yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Senegalia guacamayo is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
