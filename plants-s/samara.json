    "intro": "Samara, commonly known as a winged fruit, is a type of dry, indehiscent fruit produced by certain plants, particularly in the rose family. It consists of a single seed surrounded by a papery, wing-like structure that aids in wind dispersal. The samara is typically found in species such as maple, ash, and elm, where it plays a crucial role in seed distribution. Its unique shape allows it to glide through the air, increasing the distance it can travel from the parent plant. This adaptation enhances the plant's ability to colonize new areas and ensures genetic diversity."
