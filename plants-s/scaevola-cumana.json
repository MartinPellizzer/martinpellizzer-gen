    "intro": "Scaevola cumana, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats along sandy shores and rocky coastlines. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. Scaevola cumana is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and periodic flooding."
