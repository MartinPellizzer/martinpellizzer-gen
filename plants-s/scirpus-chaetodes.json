It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its flowering spikes, which emerge in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus chaetodes plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
