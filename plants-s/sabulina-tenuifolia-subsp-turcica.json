It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It is often found in coastal areas and is well-suited to coastal dune ecosystems. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
