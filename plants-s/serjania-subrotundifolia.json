    "intro": "Serjania subrotundifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or red serjania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. Its showy, pink to red flowers are borne in terminal clusters and attract various pollinators. Serjania subrotundifolia is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture."
