It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers that are yellow in color, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, resembling the ears of a mouse, giving it its common name. Senecio hieraciiformis is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
