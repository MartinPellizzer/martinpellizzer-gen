It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a blue-green hue. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in prairies, wetlands, and along streambanks. Sisyrinchium tenuifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
