    "intro": "Solanecio epidendricus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb that is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments. The flowers are typically followed by elongated seed pods that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal."
