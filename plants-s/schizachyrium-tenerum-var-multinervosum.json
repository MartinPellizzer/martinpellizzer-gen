    "intro": "Schizachyrium tenerum var. multinervosum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features narrow, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are characterized by their slender, linear shape and prominent veins, which give it the variety name *multinervosum*. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
