    "intro": "Scopellaria, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, sandy soils. They produce striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Scopellaria species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their hardy nature and visual appeal. The plants have a rosette of silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments."
