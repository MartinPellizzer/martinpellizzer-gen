    "intro": "Stramonium vulgare, commonly known as jimsonweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its prickly stems, lobed leaves, and showy yellow flowers that turn reddish as they mature. The plant produces small, greenish-brown berries that contain toxic compounds, including\u83a8\u83ea\u78b1 (scopolamine) and hyoscyamine. Stramonium vulgare is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, where it can thrive in full sun. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
