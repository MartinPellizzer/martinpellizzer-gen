    "intro": "Sigmatostalix pseudounguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sigmatostalix, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
