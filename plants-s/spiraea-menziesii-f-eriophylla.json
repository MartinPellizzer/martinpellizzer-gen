    "intro": "Spiraea menziesii f. eriophylla, commonly known as the pink spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its dense, mat-forming growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant spring foliage and delicate floral display."
