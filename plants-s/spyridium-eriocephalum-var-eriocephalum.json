    "intro": "Spyridium eriocephalum var. eriocephalum, commonly known as the woolly spyridium, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
