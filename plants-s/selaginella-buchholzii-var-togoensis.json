    "intro": "Selaginella buchholzii var. togoensis, commonly known as the Togo spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to West Africa. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of its stems, a feature common among many spikemosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
