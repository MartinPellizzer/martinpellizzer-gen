    "intro": "Scutellaria supina, commonly known as the prostrate skullcap, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Scutellaria supina is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties, though its botanical study remains limited."
