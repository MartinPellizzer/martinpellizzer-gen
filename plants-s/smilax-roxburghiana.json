    "intro": "Smilax roxburghiana, commonly known as the Indian arrowroot or yellow smilax, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its stout, thorned stems and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including moist and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright yellow berries, which are a source of food for various wildlife species. Smilax roxburghiana is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it both a useful and sometimes invasive plant in its native habitat."
