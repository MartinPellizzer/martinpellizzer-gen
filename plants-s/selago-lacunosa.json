    "intro": "Selago lacunosa, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. Selago lacunosa is adapted to withstand high temperatures and salt exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
