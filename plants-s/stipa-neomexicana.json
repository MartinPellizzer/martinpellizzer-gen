The plant features slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Stipa neomexicana plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
