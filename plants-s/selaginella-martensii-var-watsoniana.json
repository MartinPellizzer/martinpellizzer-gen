    "intro": "Selaginella martensii var. watsoniana, commonly known as the Watson's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. This low-growing, evergreen plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are spiral-shaped and scale-like, with a glossy green appearance that persists throughout the year. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, and it exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil."
