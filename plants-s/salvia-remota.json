    "intro": "Salvia remota, commonly known as the remote sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly fuzzy texture, often with a minty scent. Salvia remota is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
