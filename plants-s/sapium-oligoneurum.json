    "intro": "Sapium oligoneurum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ornamental horticulture. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it a notable but problematic species in ecological contexts."
