    "intro": "Setaria viridis subsp. minor, commonly known as green foxtail, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and high biomass production, it is also used in agricultural and ecological studies."
