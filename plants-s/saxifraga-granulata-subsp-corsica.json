    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata subsp. corsica, commonly known as Corsican saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It typically thrives in rocky or limestone soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
