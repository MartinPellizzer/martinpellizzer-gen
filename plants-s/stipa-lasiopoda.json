    "intro": "Stipa lasiopoda, commonly known as the tufted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive bluish sheen that helps reflect intense sunlight. Stipa lasiopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
