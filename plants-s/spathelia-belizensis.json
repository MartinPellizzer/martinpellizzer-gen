    "intro": "Spathelia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Belize. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal relationships for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Spathelia belizensis is considered a vulnerable species."
