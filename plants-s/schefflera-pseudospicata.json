    "intro": "Schefflera pseudospicata, commonly known as the Spineless Schefflera, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dense, palm-like foliage with large, compound leaves that are often dark green and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Schefflera pseudospicata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
