    "intro": "Solanum trichocalyx, commonly known as the rough-leaved nightshade, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, contain toxic compounds and are not edible. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
