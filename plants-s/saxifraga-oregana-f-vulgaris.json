    "intro": "Saxifraga oregana f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
