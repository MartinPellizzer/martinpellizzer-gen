It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical fruits that contain a sticky, oily pulp. Its seeds are encased in a hard shell and are used to produce shea butter, a valuable natural product. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and soil stabilization in forest ecosystems."
