    "intro": "Sisymbrium multifidum subsp. canescens, commonly known as the greypod shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a distinctive triangular pod that splits open to release seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
