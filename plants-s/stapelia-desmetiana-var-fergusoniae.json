It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
