    "intro": "Selaginella solmsii, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella solmsii is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water retention mechanisms."
