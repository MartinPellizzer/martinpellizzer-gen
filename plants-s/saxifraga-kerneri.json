    "intro": "Saxifraga kerneri, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found at high altitudes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Saxifraga kerneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
