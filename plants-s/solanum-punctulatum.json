    "intro": "Solanum punctulatum, commonly known as the spotted nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. Solanum punctulatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It is important to note that, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
