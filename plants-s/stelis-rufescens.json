    "intro": "Stelis rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on its aerial roots for moisture and nutrients. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with clustered leaves and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its blooms are often borne on elongated inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. Stelis rufescens requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive in cultivation."
