    "intro": "Silene degeneri, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Silene degeneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
