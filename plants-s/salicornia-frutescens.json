    "intro": "Salicornia frutescens, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in coastal environments with high salinity. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant's ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it well-adapted to saline soils and tidal zones. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds. Salicornia frutescens is also cultivated for its edible shoots, which are used in gourmet cuisine and as a nutritious food source."
