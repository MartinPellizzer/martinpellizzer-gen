    "intro": "Senecio nebrodensis var. bipinnatifidus, commonly known as the Nebrodensis Senecio, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant typically produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
