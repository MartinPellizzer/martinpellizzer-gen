    "intro": "Senecio incisus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Senecio incisus is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
