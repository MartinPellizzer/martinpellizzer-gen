    "intro": "Sussea microstigma, commonly known as the narrow-stigma sussea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that give it a distinctive appearance. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Sussea microstigma is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
