    "intro": "Stictocardia beraviensis, commonly known as the Beraviensian lichen, is a rare and specialized symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form on rock surfaces. This lichen is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often on limestone or granite substrates. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for assessing ecosystem health."
