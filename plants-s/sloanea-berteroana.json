It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.
