    "intro": "Saxifraga aculeata subsp. kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit with fleshy, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
