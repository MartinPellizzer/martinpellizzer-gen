    "intro": "Strobilocarpus diversifolius, commonly known as the variable-leaf strobilocarpus, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are diverse in shape and size, contributing to its common name, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
