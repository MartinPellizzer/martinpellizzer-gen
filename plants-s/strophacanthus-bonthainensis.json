    "intro": "Strophacanthus bonthainensis, commonly known as the Bonthain's strophacanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation."
