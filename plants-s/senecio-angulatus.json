    "intro": "Senecio angulatus, commonly known as the angular senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, featuring angular, often hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypselae. Senecio angulatus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
