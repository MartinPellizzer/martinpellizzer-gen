    "intro": "Senecio hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and rocky habitats, showcasing adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually blue-green in color and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
