    "intro": "Stellaria umbellata, commonly known as the starwort or white starflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers that are arranged in a cluster resembling an umbrella, hence its scientific name. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stellaria umbellata is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
