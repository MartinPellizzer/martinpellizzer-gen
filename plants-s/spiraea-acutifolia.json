    "intro": "Spiraea acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Spiraea acutifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
