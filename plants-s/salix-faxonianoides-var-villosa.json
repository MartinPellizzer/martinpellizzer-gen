    "intro": "Salix faxonianoides var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its distinctive hairy leaves, which are covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its adaptability makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
