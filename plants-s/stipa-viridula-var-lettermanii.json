    "intro": "Stipa viridula var. lettermanii, commonly known as the Letterman's needlegrass, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both florets and sterile lemmas. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique variation in leaf and inflorescence morphology compared to the typical form of S. viridula."
