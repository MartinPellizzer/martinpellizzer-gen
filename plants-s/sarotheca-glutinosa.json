    "intro": "Sarotheca glutinosa, commonly known as sticky leaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that secrete a resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
