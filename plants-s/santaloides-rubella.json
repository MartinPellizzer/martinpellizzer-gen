    "intro": "Santaloides rubella, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruits are usually berry-like and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
