    "intro": "Solanum pavimenti, commonly known as the ground cherry or Physalis, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits encased in a papery calyx. These fruits, which are edible when ripe, contain small, cherry-like seeds. Solanum pavimenti is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant fruits and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
