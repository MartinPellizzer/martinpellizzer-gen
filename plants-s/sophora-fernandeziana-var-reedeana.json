    "intro": "Sophora fernandeziana var. reedeana, commonly known as the Reede's Sophora, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods, a common feature among members of the legume family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
