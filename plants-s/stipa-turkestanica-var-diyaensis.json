The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
