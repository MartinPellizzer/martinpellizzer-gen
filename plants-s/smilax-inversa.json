    "intro": "Smilax inversa, commonly known as the inverted smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny foliage, which help it climb and anchor itself to trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically alternate, with a rough, textured surface and a distinctive shape. Smilax inversa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade."
