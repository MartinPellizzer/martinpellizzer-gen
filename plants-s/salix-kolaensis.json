    "intro": "Salix kolaensis, commonly known as the Kola willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in swampy areas. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
