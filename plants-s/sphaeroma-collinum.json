    "intro": "Sphaeroma collinum, commonly known as the collinear barnacle, is a small, calcareous crustacean that belongs to the order Sphaeromatida. It is typically found attached to marine substrates such as rocks, shells, and other hard surfaces in shallow coastal waters. The organism has a distinctive globular body covered in a thick layer of calcareous plates, which provides protection against predators and environmental stressors. Its feeding habits involve filter-feeding, using specialized appendages to capture planktonic organisms from the water. Sphaeroma collinum plays a minor but ecologically significant role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for other small marine organisms."
