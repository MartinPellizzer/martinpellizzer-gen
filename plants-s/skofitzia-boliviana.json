    "intro": "Skofitzia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian skofitzia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, rocky environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Skofitzia boliviana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
