    "intro": "Seselopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Gentianaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, typically blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Seselopsis species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. They have lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits that disperse their seeds. The genus is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where it thrives in temperate climates."
