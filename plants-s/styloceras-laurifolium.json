    "intro": "Styloceras laurifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of a palm. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
