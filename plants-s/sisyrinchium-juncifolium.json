It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often resembling those of sedges, hence its common name. Sisyrinchium juncifolium is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands."
