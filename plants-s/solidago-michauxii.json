It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous small florets arranged in a panicle-like inflorescence. Michaux's goldenrod is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
