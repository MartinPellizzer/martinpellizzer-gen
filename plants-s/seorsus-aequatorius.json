    "intro": "Seorsus aequatorius, commonly known as the Ecuadorian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with delicate, feather-like fronds that are often bioluminescent in the dark. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Seorsus aequatorius plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
