    "intro": "Scaphium velutinosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf scaphium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
