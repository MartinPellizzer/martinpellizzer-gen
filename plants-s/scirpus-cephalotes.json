    "intro": "Scirpus cephalotes, commonly known as the purple bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers at the top of its stems, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments. Scirpus cephalotes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
