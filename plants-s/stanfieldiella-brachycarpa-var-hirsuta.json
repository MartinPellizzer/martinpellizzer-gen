    "intro": "Stanfieldiella brachycarpa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its short, compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often covered with fine pubescence. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
