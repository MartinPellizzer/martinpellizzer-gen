    "intro": "Salix triandra var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
