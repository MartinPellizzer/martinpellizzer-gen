    "intro": "Stereoxylon serratum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are bipinnate and often serrated along the edges. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The botanical features of Stereoxylon serratum make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitats."
