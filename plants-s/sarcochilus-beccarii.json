    "intro": "Sarcochilus beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's sarcochilus, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea and nearby islands. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in high light conditions but requires consistent moisture and good air circulation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservatories."
