    "intro": "Scopolia anomala, commonly known as the lesser celandine or death bloom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant contains various alkaloids, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which have been historically used in medicine but are also toxic in high doses. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value is sometimes overshadowed by its potential toxicity and invasive tendencies in certain regions."
