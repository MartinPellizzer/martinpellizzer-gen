    "intro": "Stachys recta f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spikes of small, two-lipped, violet to blue flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
