    "intro": "Sunipia cumberlegei, commonly known as the Cumberlege sunflower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange petals and a tall, slender stem that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sunipia cumberlegei is considered an endangered species."
