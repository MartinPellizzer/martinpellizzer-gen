    "intro": "Saxifraga corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a corymbose inflorescence. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Saxifraga corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
