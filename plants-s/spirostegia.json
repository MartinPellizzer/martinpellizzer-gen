These plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble small orchids, with intricate petal structures. They are typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Spirostegia species are perennial herbs, often growing close to the ground with fibrous roots. Their botanical significance lies in their adaptability to harsh environments and their role in ecological systems."
