    "intro": "Specklinia stillsonii, commonly known as the stillson's pigmy orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has slender, wiry stems with small, dark green leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its flowers are delicate, with a pale green or white coloration and a distinctive, fragrant scent. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
