    "intro": "Sanguinaria humifusa, commonly known as the red-pink winter creeper, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in early spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it thrives in moist, shady woodland environments. Sanguinaria humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
