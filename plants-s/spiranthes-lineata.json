    "intro": "Spiranthes lineata, commonly known as the fragrant pink twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has a slender, grass-like appearance with a single, erect stem that bears a dense cluster of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its delicate, spiral-like arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name."
