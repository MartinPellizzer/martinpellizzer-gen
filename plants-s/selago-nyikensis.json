    "intro": "Selago nyikensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert grass, is a succulent plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers adapted to arid environments. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with small, rounded leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Its flowers are typically small and star-shaped, often in shades of yellow or white, and bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Selago nyikensis plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
