    "intro": "Sicyos kunthii, commonly known as the giant stick-tight fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sicyos kunthii is notable for its ability to produce a sticky substance that can trap small insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
