    "intro": "Solanum rivulare, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, hairy stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, followed by yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. Solanum rivulare belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other toxic and economically important plants. Its botanical features make it a common weed in disturbed soils and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
