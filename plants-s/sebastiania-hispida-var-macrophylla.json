    "intro": "Sebastiania hispida var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved Sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its notably larger leaves, which can reach up to 15 cm in length."
