It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the upper surface. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Solidago delicatula plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
