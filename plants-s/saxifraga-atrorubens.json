    "intro": "Saxifraga atrorubens, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dark green, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga atrorubens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitats."
