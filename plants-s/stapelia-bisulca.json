    "intro": "Stapelia bisulca, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often spiny stems. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Stapelia bisulca is a popular choice for cacti and succulent enthusiasts due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
