    "intro": "Scurrula medinensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean scurrula, is a rare and specialized plant native to southern Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense, umbrella-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
