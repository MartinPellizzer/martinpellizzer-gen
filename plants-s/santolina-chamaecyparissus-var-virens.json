    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. virens, commonly known as green santolina, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a distinctive pine-like fragrance, and its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late spring. The plant has aromatic leaves that are often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature. The varietal name 'virens' refers to its vivid, greenish hue, distinguishing it from other santolina varieties."
