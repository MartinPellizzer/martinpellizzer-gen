    "intro": "Steviopsis vigintiseta, commonly known as the silver-haired stevia, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract various pollinators. Steviopsis vigintiseta is valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds similar to those found in traditional stevia species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal gardening."
