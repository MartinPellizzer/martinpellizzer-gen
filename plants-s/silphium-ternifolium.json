    "intro": "Silphium ternifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved compass plant, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and leaves that are divided into three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Silphium ternifolium is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has historical significance as a medicinal plant."
