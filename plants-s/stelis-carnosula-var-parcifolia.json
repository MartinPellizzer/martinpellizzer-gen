    "intro": "Stelis carnosula var. parcifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces multiple stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are fleshy and thick, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The varietal name 'parcifolia' refers to its reduced leaf number, distinguishing it from other varieties of Stelis carnosula."
