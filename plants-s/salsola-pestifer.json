    "intro": "Salsola pestifer, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual shrub native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its spiny, deltoid-shaped leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
