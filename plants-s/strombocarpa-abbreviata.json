    "intro": "Strombocarpa abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is often found growing in rocky coastal areas and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Strombocarpa abbreviata is considered a vulnerable species."
