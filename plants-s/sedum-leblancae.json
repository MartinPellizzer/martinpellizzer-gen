    "intro": "Sedum leblancae, commonly known as the Whiteleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features fleshy, pale green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in summer. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
