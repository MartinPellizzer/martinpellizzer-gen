    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 blatii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
