    "intro": "Salvia cinnabarina, commonly known as the scarlet salvia, is a striking perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bright red, tubular flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its vibrant color and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
