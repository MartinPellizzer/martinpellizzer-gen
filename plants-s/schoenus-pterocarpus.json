    "intro": "Schoenus pterocarpus, commonly known as the tufted marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it forms dense stands. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Schoenus pterocarpus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
