    "intro": "Sagittaria latifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are arrowhead-shaped, with a distinctive V-shaped base. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from summer to early fall. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its adaptability makes it a valuable species for wetland restoration and ecological studies."
