    "intro": "Soda cyrenaica, commonly known as the desert soda, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Soda cyrenaica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
