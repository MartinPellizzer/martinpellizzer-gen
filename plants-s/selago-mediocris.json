    "intro": "Selago mediocris, commonly known as the common starflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salty air and coastal winds. Selago mediocris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
