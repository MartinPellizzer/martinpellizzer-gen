    "intro": "Salvia mentiens, commonly known as the mental sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming and antispasmodic properties. The plant's resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy choice for gardeners in arid climates."
