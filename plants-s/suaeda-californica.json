    "intro": "Suaeda californica, commonly known as coast saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Suaeda californica plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
