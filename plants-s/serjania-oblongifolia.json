    "intro": "Serjania oblongifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red mangaba, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. The fruit is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor, often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
