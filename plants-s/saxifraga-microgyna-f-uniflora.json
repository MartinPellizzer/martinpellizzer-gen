    "intro": "Saxifraga microgyna f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered saxifrage, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on exposed soil or among stones. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
