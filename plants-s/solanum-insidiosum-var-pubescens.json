    "intro": "Solanum insidiosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
