    "intro": "Selago trinervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments. Selago trinervia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
