    "intro": "Senna papillosa var. papillosa, commonly known as the silky senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its bipinnate leaves with silky, hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds, contributing to its dispersal. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye due to its chemical compounds."
