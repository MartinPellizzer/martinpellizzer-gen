It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called caryopses. Selago seticaulis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
