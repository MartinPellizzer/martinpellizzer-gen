    "intro": "Swartzia sumorum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Swartzia sumorum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
