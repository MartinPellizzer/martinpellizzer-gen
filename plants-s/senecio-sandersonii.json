    "intro": "Senecio sandersonii, commonly known as the sanderson's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
