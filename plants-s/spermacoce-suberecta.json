    "intro": "Spermacoce suberecta, commonly known as the upright spurred morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, spurred flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in various soil types. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, facilitating its dispersal. Spermacoce suberecta is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
