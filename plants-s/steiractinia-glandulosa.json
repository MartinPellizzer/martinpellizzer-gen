    "intro": "Steiractinia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular steiractinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
