    "intro": "Schoutenia, commonly known as the \"silk tree\" or \"balsa tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. Schoutenia species are characterized by their large, showy flowers and fibrous, lightweight wood, which has been historically used for various purposes. The plants typically grow as trees or shrubs, with compound leaves and capsule fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, several species within this genus are now considered endangered."
