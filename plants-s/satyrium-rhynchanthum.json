It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the acidic soil. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
