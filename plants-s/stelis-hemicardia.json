    "intro": "Stelis hemicardia, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features small, clustered pseudobulbs and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped, giving it its common name. Stelis hemicardia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
