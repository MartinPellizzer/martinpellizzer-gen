    "intro": "Solanum ellipticum var. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a bright red or yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
