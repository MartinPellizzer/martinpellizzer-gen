    "intro": "Styphelia crassiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal areas of southeastern Australia. It features small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dense and evergreen, providing a compact, ornamental appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Styphelia crassiflora is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and attractive floral display."
