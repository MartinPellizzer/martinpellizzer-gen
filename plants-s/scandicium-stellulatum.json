    "intro": "Scandicium stellulatum, commonly known as the star-dot moss, is a low-growing evergreen moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms dense, cushion-like mats and is often found in forest floors or on rocky surfaces. The plant's leaves are typically small, lance-shaped, and arranged in two rows, giving it a star-like appearance. It reproduces through spores released from capsule-like structures that develop on the stems. Scandicium stellulatum plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
