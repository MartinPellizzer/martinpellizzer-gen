    "intro": "Saxifraga cartilaginea subsp. erubescens, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The flowers are typically pink to reddish in color, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
