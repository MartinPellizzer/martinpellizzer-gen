    "intro": "Strychnos dysophylla, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
