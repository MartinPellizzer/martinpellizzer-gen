It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
