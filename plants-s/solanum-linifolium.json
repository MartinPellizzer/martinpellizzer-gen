    "intro": "Solanum linifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by rounded, violet-colored berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
