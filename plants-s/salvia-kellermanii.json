    "intro": "Salvia kellermanii, commonly known as the Kellerman's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and spikes of violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Salvia kellermanii is also valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
