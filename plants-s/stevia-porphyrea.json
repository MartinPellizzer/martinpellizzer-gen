    "intro": "Stevia porphyrea, commonly known as purple stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweet taste, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. Its leaves are often used as a natural sweetener in food and beverages. Stevia porphyrea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation."
