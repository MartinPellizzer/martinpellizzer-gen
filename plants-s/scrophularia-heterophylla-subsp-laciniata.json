    "intro": "Scrophularia heterophylla subsp. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaf figwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed or toothed, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The species is valued in ecological gardens for its ability to support pollinators and its ornamental appeal."
