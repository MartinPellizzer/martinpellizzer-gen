    "intro": "Schefflera distractiflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian schefflera, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. Schefflera distractiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in Hawaiian ecosystems."
