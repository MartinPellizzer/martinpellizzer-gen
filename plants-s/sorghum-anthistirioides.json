    "intro": "Sorghum anthistirioides, commonly known as the African millet, is a small, annual grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale yellow to green flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in poor soils and requiring minimal water. Due to its resilience, it is often cultivated as a staple food crop in regions with limited agricultural resources."
