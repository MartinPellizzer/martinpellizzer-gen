    "intro": "Siphocampylus schizandrus, commonly known as the Chinese angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to China and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions, though its toxicity limits widespread use."
