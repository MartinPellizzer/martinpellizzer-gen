It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Spergula pilifera is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
