    "intro": "Solanum lycopersicoides, commonly known as the wild tomato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. It is closely related to the domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and shares similar botanical features. Due to its wild nature, it is often found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
