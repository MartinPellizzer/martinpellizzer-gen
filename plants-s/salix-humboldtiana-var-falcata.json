    "intro": "Salix humboldtiana var. falcata, commonly known as the Humboldt's weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fibrous texture that becomes more rugged as the tree matures. This variety is well adapted to moist environments and is often found near rivers and streams."
