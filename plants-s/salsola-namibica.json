    "intro": "Salsola namibica, commonly known as Namib sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and southern Angola. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and desert environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has succulent leaves that help it conserve water. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep moisture sources in arid conditions. Salsola namibica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert fauna."
