    "intro": "Spiranthes rhombilabia, commonly known as the rhombic spiral orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a compact, rosette-like growth habit, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened or endangered in many parts of its range."
