    "intro": "Sinapis arvensis f. orientalis, commonly known as oriental mustard, is a variant of the wild mustard plant native to parts of Asia. It is an annual herb characterized by its erect stem and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions. The species is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields, where it can compete with cultivated crops."
