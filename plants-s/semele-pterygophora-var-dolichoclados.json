    "intro": "Semele pterygophora var. dolichoclados, commonly known as the long-stemmed flame fern, is a rare and striking member of the fern family. It is characterized by its elongated, gracefully arching fronds that can reach several feet in length. The plant features a distinctive, slender rhizome with a fibrous sheath, typical of many fern species. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
