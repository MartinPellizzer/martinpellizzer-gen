    "intro": "Schoenus tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender leaf sedgeland, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks or in swampy areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Schoenus tenuifolius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
