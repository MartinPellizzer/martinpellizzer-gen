    "intro": "Saponaria corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled soapwort, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wrinkled texture, giving it its common name. Its root system produces a saponin-rich sap, which has historical uses in soap-making and as a natural insecticide. Saponaria corrugata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
