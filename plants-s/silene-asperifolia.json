It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Silene asperifolia is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic environments."
