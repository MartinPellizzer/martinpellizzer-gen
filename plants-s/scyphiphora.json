    "intro": "Scyphiphora, commonly known as the water fern or scyphiphora herb, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plants typically have slender, creeping rhizomes and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by a spathe. Scyphiphora species are known for their ability to thrive in moist environments and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Their botanical features make them important components of wetland ecosystems."
