    "intro": "Sclerochloa kengiana, commonly known as the Kengian grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
