    "intro": "Sasamorpha borealis var. pilosa, commonly known as the northern hairy sasamorpha, is a rare flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine and boreal ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
