    "intro": "Streptachne pilosa, commonly known as hairy bristlegrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Streptachne pilosa is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
