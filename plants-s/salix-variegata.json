    "intro": "Salix variegata, commonly known as the variegated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and striking variegated leaves that display white and yellow patterns. The plant produces small catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
