    "intro": "Scleria zambesica, commonly known as the Zambesi bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scleria zambesica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
