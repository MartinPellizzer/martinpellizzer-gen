    "intro": "Sinosophiopsis bartholomewii, commonly known as the Bartholomew's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on cliffs or rocky outcrops, thriving in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption from the air, a trait common among epiphytic orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
