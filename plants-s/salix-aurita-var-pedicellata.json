    "intro": "Salix aurita var. pedicellata, commonly known as the weeping willow with pendant catkins, is a variant of the weeping willow native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces catkins that hang in clusters, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth texture and a silvery underside. It thrives in moist environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
