    "intro": "Selaginella decurrens, commonly known as the stair-step spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella decurrens is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its use in horticulture as an ornamental plant."
