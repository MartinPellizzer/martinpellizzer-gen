    "intro": "Sedum eurycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces thick, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sedum eurycarpum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscapes. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
