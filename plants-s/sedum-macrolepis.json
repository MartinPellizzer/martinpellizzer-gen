    "intro": "Sedum macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum macrolepis is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
