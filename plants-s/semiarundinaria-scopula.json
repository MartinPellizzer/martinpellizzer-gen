The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. Semiarundinaria scopula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
