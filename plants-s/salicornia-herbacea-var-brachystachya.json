    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. brachystachya, commonly known as sea bean, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils. The plant produces small, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife."
