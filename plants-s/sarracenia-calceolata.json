    "intro": "Sarracenia calceolata, commonly known as the pink spathed pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped pitchers that are often tinged with pink or red hues. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized traps that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to break down prey. Sarracenia calceolata thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and bright light for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
