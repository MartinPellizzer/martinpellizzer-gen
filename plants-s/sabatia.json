    "intro": "Sabatia, commonly known as the \"blazing star,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to North America and are often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands. They are characterized by their showy, often pink or purple, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Sabatia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and some varieties are used in traditional herbal medicine. Their vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity."
