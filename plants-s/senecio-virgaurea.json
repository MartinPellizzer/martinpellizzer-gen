    "intro": "Senecio virgaurea, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Senecio virgaurea is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it both a weed and a pioneer species in ecological succession."
