    "intro": "Salix nankingensis, commonly known as the Nanjing willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Salix nankingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in urban and riparian landscapes."
