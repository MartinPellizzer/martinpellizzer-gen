    "intro": "Selaginella negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros spikemoss, is a rare and endemic vascular plant found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, spiky leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in montane forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
