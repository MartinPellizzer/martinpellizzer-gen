    "intro": "Scolopendrium brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features whorled, needle-like leaves and produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystem. Scolopendrium brasiliense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
