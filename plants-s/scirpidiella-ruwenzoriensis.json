    "intro": "Scirpidiella ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is adapted to the cool, moist environments of mountainous grasslands and wetlands. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
