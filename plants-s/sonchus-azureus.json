    "intro": "Sonchus azureus, commonly known as blue sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. The plant features a rosette of silver- or blue-hued leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
