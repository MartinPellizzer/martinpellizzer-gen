    "intro": "Stilpnopappus bullatus, commonly known as the bullate cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems."
