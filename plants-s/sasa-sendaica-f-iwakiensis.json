It is a clump-forming perennial grass that grows in dense, upright clusters, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its culms (stems) are hollow and jointed, a characteristic feature of the grass family. This bamboo is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
