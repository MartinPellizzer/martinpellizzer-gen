    "intro": "Stemodia radicans, commonly known as the spreading stemodia, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
