It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. It typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Sedum magnolii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil types."
