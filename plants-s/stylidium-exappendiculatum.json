    "intro": "Stylidium exappendiculatum, commonly known as the appendiculate spurred orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred labellum and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathland or open forest habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
