    "intro": "Salsola arborescens, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its branched, woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy habitats. Salsola arborescens is well adapted to drought and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
