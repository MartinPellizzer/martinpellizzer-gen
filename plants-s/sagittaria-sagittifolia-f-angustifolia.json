    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its slender, arrow-shaped leaves. It is a water-loving perennial that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
