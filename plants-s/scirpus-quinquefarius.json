    "intro": "Scirpus quinquefarius, commonly known as the five-flowered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically arranged in five spikelets. Scirpus quinquefarius thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
