    "intro": "Selaginella ambigua var. fallax, commonly known as the variable spikemoss, is a rare and specialized member of the spikemoss family. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a trait common among ancient vascular plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
