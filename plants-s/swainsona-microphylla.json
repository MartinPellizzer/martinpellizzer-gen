    "intro": "Swainsona microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved swainsona, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and inland semi-arid areas. Swainsona microphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
