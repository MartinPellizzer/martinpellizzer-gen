    "intro": "Scholtzia truncata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 30 to 90 centimeters in height, featuring a robust, fleshy stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Scholtzia truncata is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
