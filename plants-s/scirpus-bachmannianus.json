    "intro": "Scirpus bachmannianus, commonly known as Bachmann's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering stems that rise from rhizomatous roots, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Scirpus bachmannianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
