It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in various food products. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of natural sweeteners."
