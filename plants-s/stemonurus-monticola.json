    "intro": "Stemonurus monticola, commonly known as the mountain stemonurus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Stemonuraceae and is characterized by its fibrous root system and upright, branched stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
