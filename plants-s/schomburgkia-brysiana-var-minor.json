    "intro": "Schomburgkia brysiana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf schomburgkia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a red throat, during the summer months. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among gardeners seeking a tropical look in temperate climates."
