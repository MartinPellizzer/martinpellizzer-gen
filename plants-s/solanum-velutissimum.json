It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Solanum velutissimum produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is considered a minor weed in some regions but has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
