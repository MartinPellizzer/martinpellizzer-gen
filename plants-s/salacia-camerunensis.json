    "intro": "Salacia camerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon salacia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Salacia camerunensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
