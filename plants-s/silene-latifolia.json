It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, oval seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Silene latifolia is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its oil-rich seeds."
