    "intro": "Salix retusa subf. denticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting wildlife."
