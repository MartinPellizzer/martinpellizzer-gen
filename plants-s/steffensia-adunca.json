    "intro": "Steffensia adunca, commonly known as the slender stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Steffensia adunca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific climate requirements."
