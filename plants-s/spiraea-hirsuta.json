    "intro": "Spiraea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a rough, hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
