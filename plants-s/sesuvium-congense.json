    "intro": "Sesuvium congense, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or coastal areas. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
