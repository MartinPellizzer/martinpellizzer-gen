    "intro": "Selaginella xerophila, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Selaginella xerophila is a resurrection plant, capable of surviving extreme desiccation and reviving when water becomes available. Its unique adaptations make it an important species in ecological studies of drought tolerance."
