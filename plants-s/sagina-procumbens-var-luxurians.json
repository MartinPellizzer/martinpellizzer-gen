    "intro": "Sagina procumbens var. luxurians, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, giving the plant a silvery appearance. The flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to colonize open spaces quickly."
