    "intro": "Steiractinia trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' spider orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small but striking, featuring a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that mimic the appearance of spiders, a trait that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
