    "intro": "Swainsona calcicola, commonly known as the limestone swainsona, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are often small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Swainsona calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
