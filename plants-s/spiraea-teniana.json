    "intro": "Spiraea teniana, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Spiraea teniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
