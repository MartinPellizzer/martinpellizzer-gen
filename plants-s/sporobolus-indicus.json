    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus, commonly known as Indian sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas or along roadsides. Sporobolus indicus is adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
