    "intro": "Stellaria graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, grass-like leaves and small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowering stems are often branched and bear numerous tiny flowers, which attract various pollinators. Stellaria graminifolia is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found growing in dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
