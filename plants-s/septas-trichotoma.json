    "intro": "Septas trichotoma, commonly known as the three-branched sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features a branching stem system with three main branches, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Septas trichotoma is often found growing on rocky shores and sandy beaches, where it tolerates high salinity and strong winds."
