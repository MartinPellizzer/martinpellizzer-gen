It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive features. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside that gives it a unique appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
