    "intro": "Sorbus domestica var. pyriformis, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often egg-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits called pomes. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in woodland or along stream banks. This variety is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
