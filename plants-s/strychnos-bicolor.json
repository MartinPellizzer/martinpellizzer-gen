    "intro": "Strychnos bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale or white on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both medicinal and cautionary interest. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
