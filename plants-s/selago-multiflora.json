    "intro": "Selago multiflora, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often found along the shorelines. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, daisy-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain water in arid conditions. Selago multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
