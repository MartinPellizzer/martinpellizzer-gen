It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Selaginella dregei is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms."
