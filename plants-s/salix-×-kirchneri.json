    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 kirchneri, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
