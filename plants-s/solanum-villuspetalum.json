    "intro": "Solanum villuspetalum, commonly known as the velvety nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to white. It produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic effects."
