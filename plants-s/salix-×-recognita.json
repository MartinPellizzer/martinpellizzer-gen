    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 recognita, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix babylonica (Babylonian willow), resulting in its distinctive weeping habit. The plant features long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a common ornamental species in gardens and parks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically valuable."
