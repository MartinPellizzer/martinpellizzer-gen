    "intro": "Spiraea cudidaghensis, commonly known as the Cudidagh spirea, is a shrub native to the island of Cudidagh in the Republic of Ireland. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native habitat."
