    "intro": "Statice echioides, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice echioides is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and long-lasting blooms."
