    "intro": "Struthanthus oerstedii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a robust, succulent stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Struthanthus oerstedii is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for desert landscapes."
