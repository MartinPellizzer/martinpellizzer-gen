    "intro": "Salvia columbariae, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia columbariae is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
