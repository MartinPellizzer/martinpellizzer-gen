    "intro": "Scolopendrium vulgare var. ramosum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant with a creeping habit, characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cones, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
