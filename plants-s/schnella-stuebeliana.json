The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schnella stuebeliana is considered a species of conservation concern."
