    "intro": "Smithsonia viridiflora, commonly known as the Emerald-flowered Smithsonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Smithsonia viridiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
