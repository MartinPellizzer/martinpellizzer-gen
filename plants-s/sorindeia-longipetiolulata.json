    "intro": "Sorindeia longipetiolulata, commonly known as the long-petioled sorindeia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated petioles that support its broad, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and usually have five petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
