    "intro": "Salix angiolepis, commonly known as the American weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers as the tree matures. Salix angiolepis is often found near water sources, such as rivers and lakes, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
