    "intro": "Selaginella davaoensis, commonly known as the Davao spikemoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its morphology includes a short, creeping stem with whorled leaves, and it exhibits a form of vegetative reproduction through its rhizomes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
