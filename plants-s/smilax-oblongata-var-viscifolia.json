    "intro": "Smilax oblongata var. viscifolia, commonly known as the sticky nightshade or prickly nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tubers and its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces greenish-yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its botanical features make it both a notable ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain habitats."
