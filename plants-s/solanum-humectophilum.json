    "intro": "Solanum humectophilum, commonly known as the moisture-loving nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to humid tropical regions. It thrives in environments with high humidity and consistent moisture, often found in shaded, moist forests. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Solanum humectophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
