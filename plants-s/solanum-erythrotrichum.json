    "intro": "Solanum erythrotrichum, commonly known as the red-hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments and has adapted to thrive in dry conditions. Its fruit is a small, yellowish berry that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided as a food source and is more noted for its ecological and botanical significance."
