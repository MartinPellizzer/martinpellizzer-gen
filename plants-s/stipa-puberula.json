    "intro": "Stipa puberula, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa puberula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
