    "intro": "Stellaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals that bloom in clusters, often resembling a star, hence its genus name \"Stellaria.\" The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Stellaria angustifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
