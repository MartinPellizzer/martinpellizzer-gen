    "intro": "Stipa vaseyi, commonly known as the Vasey's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and fine, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems produce dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Stipa vaseyi plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
