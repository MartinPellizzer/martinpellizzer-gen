    "intro": "Saxifraga biflora subsp. macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense inflorescences, and the subspecies is distinguished by its larger petals compared to other members of the species. Saxifraga biflora subsp. macropetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
