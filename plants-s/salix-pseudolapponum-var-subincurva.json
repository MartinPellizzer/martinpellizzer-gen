    "intro": "Salix pseudolapponum var. subincurva, commonly known as the bent willow, is a shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, flexible branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction and contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
