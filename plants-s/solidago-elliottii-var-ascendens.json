    "intro": "Solidago elliottii var. ascendens, commonly known as Elliott's goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features erect, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, covered with fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly rough texture. This variant is closely related to other goldenrod species but is distinguished by its taller growth habit and specific geographic distribution."
