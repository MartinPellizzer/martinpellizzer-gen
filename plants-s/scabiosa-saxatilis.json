    "intro": "Scabiosa saxatilis, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in limestone or sandy habitats. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scabiosa saxatilis is also known for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
