    "intro": "Sida rhomboidea, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Sida rhomboidea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can influence soil fertility."
