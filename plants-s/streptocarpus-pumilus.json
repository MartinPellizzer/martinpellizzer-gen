    "intro": "Streptocarpus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf streptocarpus, is a compact, flowering plant native to South Africa. It features velvety, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and blue, which bloom during the summer months. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its compact size and ease of care. Streptocarpus pumilus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
