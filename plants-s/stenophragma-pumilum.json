    "intro": "Stenophragma pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the eastern United States and is often found in mixed forests. Its unique life cycle and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
