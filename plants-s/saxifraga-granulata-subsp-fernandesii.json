    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata subsp. fernandesii, commonly known as the Portuguese saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Azores. It features dense, rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
