    "intro": "Solanum lineatum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features slender, trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often carpeting the ground in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Solanum lineatum is often cultivated as a ground cover or ornamental plant due to its rapid growth and attractive foliage."
