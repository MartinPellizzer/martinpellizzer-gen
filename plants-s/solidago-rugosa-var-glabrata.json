It features upright, branched stems covered with rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, rayless flowers in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
