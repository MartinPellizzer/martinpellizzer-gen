It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
