    "intro": "Selaginella paxii, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has whorled leaves that are often scale-like, and it produces sporophylls that bear spores instead of flowers. Selaginella paxii is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing structures. It is native to regions of Mexico and Central America, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
