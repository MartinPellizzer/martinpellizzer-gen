    "intro": "Smilax rigida, commonly known as the prickly pear vine, is a woody, climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a thick, thorny stem covered with sharp, stiff spines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture with a serrated edge. Smilax rigida is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and swamps."
