It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and rough, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming an invasive species. Its growth habit and morphology make it adaptable to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions."
