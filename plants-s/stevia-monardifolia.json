    "intro": "Stevia monardifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf or honey plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often used as a natural sweetener. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves contain high levels of steviol glycosides, which are responsible for its intense sweetness. Stevia monardifolia is cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
