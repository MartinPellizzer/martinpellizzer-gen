    "intro": "Scabiosa nitida, commonly known as the silver scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Scabiosa nitida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
