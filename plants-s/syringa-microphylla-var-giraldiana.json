    "intro": "Syringa microphylla var. giraldiana, commonly known as the dwarf weeping lilac, is a compact shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and fragrant, pale lavender flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a weeping habit, with branches that cascade downward, creating a distinctive, ornamental shape. It is well-suited for small gardens or container growing due to its compact size. The leaves turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
