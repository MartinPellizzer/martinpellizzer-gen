    "intro": "Schefflera acutissima, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like crown composed of multiple leaf clusters radiating from a central stem. The leaves are typically glossy, dark green, and have a pointed tip, giving the plant its scientific name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, though these are not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes. Schefflera acutissima is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
