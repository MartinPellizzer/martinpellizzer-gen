    "intro": "Solanum inflatum, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its inflated, balloon-like fruits that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is edible when ripe but contains toxic compounds when unripe, making it important to handle with care."
