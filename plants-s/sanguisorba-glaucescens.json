    "intro": "Sanguisorba glaucescens, commonly known as blue stemmed sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are typically blue-green in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Sanguisorba glaucescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
