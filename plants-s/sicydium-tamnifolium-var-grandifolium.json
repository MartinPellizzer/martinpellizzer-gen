It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in panicles, and are typically white or pale yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
