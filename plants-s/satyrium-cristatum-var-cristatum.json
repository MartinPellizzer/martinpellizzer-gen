It is characterized by its striking, hairy leaves and a unique inflorescence that bears a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
