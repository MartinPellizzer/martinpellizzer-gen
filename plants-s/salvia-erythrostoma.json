    "intro": "Salvia erythrostoma, commonly known as the red-stemmed sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that turn reddish-purple as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Salvia erythrostoma is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
