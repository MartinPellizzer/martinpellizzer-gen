    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate ornamental value. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. It is widely cultivated in water gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
