    "intro": "Schismatoglottis marginata, commonly known as the margins leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, strap-like leaves with distinctive white margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schismatoglottis marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage and unique floral display."
