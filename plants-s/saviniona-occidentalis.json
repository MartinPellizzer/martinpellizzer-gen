    "intro": "Saviniona occidentalis, commonly known as the western savinea, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. Due to its low-growing nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
