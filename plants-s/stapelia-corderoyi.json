    "intro": "Stapelia corderoyi, commonly known as the Cape Town Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, waxy flowers that resemble a decaying animal. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically small and cylindrical, adapted to store water in arid environments. Stapelia corderoyi is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and striking appearance."
