    "intro": "Scaphyglottis limonensis, commonly known as the lemon-scented orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that emit a subtle lemon-like aroma. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Scaphyglottis limonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique fragrance and aesthetic qualities."
