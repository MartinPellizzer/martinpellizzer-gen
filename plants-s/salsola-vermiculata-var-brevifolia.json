    "intro": "Salsola vermiculata var. brevifolia, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to high levels of sunlight and low precipitation."
