    "intro": "Stipa speciosa var. media, commonly known as the compact bluegrass or dwarf feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and feathery plumes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and airy flower heads, which add texture and movement to the landscape."
