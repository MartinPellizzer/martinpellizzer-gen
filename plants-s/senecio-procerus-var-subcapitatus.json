    "intro": "Senecio procerus var. subcapitatus, commonly known as the tall senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
