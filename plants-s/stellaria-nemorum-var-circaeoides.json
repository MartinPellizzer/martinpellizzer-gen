    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum var. circaeoides, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its close relationship to the species *Stellaria nemorum*, with the varietal name *circaeoides* referring to its resemblance to the genus *Circaea*."
