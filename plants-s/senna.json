    "intro": "Senna, commonly known as the senna plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions across Africa, the Americas, and Asia, and they are often found in tropical and subtropical climates. Senna species are characterized by their bipinnate leaves, which are compound and often feather-like in appearance. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive shape that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Many senna species are used in traditional medicine and as natural dyes due to their chemical properties."
