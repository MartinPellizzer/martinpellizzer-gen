    "intro": "Scirpus arenarius var. setiformis, commonly known as the sand reed or coastal bulrush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in brackish or saline wetlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in salty environments. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
