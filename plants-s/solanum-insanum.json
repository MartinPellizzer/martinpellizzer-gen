    "intro": "Solanum insanum, commonly known as the devil's apple, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into toxic, fleshy berries with a distinctive, unpleasant odor. These berries contain alkaloids, making them poisonous to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity and aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions."
