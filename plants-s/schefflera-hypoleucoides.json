    "intro": "Schefflera hypoleucoides, commonly known as the white-veined umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, though these are not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
