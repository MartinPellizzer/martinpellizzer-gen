    "intro": "Scirpus flavescens, commonly known as yellow bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems that are typically yellowish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Scirpus flavescens plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
