    "intro": "Senecio aureus var. pauperculus, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are slightly ribbed and covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle floral touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and dry garden environments."
