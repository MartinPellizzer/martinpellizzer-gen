    "intro": "Solanum asperum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, often spiny stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Solanum asperum is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
