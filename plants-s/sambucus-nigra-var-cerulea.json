    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. cerulea, commonly known as the blue elderberry, is a variant of the elderberry plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-purple berries, which are smaller and more intensely colored than those of the common elderberry. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. The blue elderberry is often used in traditional medicine and can be cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal."
