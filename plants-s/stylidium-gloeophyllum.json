It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique feature is the presence of sticky glands on its stems and leaves, which help in trapping insects. Stylidium gloeophyllum is also known for its ability to form dense mats, making it a characteristic component of certain ecosystems."
