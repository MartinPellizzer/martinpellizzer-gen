    "intro": "Stipa kingii, commonly known as King's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Stipa kingii is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
