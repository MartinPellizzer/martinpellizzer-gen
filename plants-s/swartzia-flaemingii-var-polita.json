    "intro": "Swartzia flaemingii var. polita, commonly known as the velvetwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its smooth, dark, almost velvety bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The wood of Swartzia flaemingii var. polita is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in woodworking."
