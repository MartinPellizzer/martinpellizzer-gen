    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The species is often found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and mountainous regions, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
