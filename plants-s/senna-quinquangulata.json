It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring pinnately compound leaves with five angular leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a pod and are often used in traditional medicine for their laxative properties. Senna quinquangulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
