    "intro": "Stelis pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a compact, branching structure with delicate, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and often white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Stelis pygmaea is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
