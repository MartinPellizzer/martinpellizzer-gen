    "intro": "Setaria effusa, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a grass species native to warm temperate regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, finger-like inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy crop in arid environments. Its seeds are small and are often used as a grain for human and animal consumption. Setaria effusa is also an important plant in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
