    "intro": "Santalum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic tree native to the tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and fine furniture. The species is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and ecologically significant plant."
