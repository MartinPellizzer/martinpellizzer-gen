    "intro": "Selaginella leucobryoides, commonly known as the white moss spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to moist, shaded environments in the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, moss-like mats. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branching stems. Its roots are adapted for efficient water absorption, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Selaginella leucobryoides is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
