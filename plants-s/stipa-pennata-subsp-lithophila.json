    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. lithophila, commonly known as the Lithophytic Needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to rocky and limestone-rich environments. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
