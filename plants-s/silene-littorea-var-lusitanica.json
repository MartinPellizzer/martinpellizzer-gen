    "intro": "Silene littorea var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. The plant produces pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Silene littorea var. lusitanica is often found in maritime environments, contributing to the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems."
