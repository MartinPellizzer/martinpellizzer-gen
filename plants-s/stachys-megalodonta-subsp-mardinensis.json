    "intro": "Stachys megalodonta subsp. mardinensis, commonly known as the Mardin giant betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its robust stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in dense whorls along the upper stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
