    "intro": "Spilanthes wedelioides, commonly known as the wedgeleaf bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and wedge-shaped, giving it its common name, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Spilanthes wedelioides is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
