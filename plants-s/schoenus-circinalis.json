    "intro": "Schoenus circinalis, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in Australia. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to the ecological health of wetlands. Schoenus circinalis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often found in swamps, lakes, and riverine environments."
