    "intro": "Spermacoce coccinea, commonly known as red rattlebox, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red, bead-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by ants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Spermacoce coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
