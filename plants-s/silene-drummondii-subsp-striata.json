    "intro": "Silene drummondii subsp. striata, commonly known as the Drummond's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
