    "intro": "Saxifraga stella-aurea, commonly known as the golden star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features clusters of star-shaped, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has small, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in its rocky, alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices or on slopes. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
