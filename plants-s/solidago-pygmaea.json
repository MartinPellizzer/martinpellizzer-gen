    "intro": "Solidago pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems that are covered with small, hairy leaves. Its most striking feature is its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Solidago pygmaea plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
