    "intro": "Securidaca marajoara, commonly known as the Marajoara devil's claw, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with distinctive seed pods. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many members of its family. Due to its habitat in tropical rainforests, it is often found growing in shaded, moist environments near rivers and streams."
