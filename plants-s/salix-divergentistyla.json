    "intro": "Salix divergentistyla, commonly known as the divergent willow, is a rare and specialized species of willow native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils where it forms dense, low-growing shrubs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in catkins, and it plays a role in stabilizing fragile mountain ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salix divergentistyla is considered a vulnerable species."
