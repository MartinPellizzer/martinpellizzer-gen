    "intro": "Serapias, commonly known as the \"lady's shoes,\" are flowering plants belonging to the family Gentianaceae. They are native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The genus includes several species, such as Serapias grandiflora and Serapias vernalis, which are characterized by their showy, often orange or yellow flowers. These plants typically have basal leaves and are adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Their vibrant blooms make them popular in horticulture, though they require specific care to thrive."
