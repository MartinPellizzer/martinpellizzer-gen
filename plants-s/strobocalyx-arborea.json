    "intro": "Strobocalyx arborea, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Strobocalyx arborea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
