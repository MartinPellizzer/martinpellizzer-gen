    "intro": "Salix linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces catkins in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. It has a shallow root system and is relatively fast-growing, making it a common species in riparian zones. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
