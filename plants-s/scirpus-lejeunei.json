    "intro": "Scirpus lejeunei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in the summer, typically in shades of brown or pink. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Scirpus lejeunei plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
