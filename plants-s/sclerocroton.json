    "intro": "Sclerocroton, commonly known as the African croton, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often colorful leaves and showy inflorescences. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with some species found in Southeast Asia. Sclerocroton species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in arid environments. The plants are also known for their milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
