It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, maritime climates. It is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Styphelia cornifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
