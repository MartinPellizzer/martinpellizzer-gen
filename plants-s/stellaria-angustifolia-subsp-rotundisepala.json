    "intro": "Stellaria angustifolia subsp. rotundisepala, commonly known as the rounded-sepals starwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a low-growing herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, while the sepals are rounded, giving the subspecies its distinguishing name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring."
