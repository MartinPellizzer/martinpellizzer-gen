It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its small white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
