    "intro": "Sarcorhynchus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sarcocarp, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. Its leaves are compound, with a serrated margin and a strong, spicy scent. Due to habitat loss, Sarcorhynchus orientalis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation."
