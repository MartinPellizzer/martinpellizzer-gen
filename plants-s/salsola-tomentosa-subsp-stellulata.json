    "intro": "Salsola tomentosa subsp. stellulata, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in deserts, dunes, and rocky areas. Salsola tomentosa subsp. stellulata is a hardy species adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation."
