    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 cullinanii, commonly known as the Cullinan's saxifrage, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green or blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
