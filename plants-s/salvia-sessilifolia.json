    "intro": "Salvia sessilifolia, commonly known as purple sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. The plant produces striking spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its drought-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The leaves and flowers are often used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
