    "intro": "Salix laevis, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often silvery underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Salix laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
