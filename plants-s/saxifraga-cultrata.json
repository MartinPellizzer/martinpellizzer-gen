    "intro": "Saxifraga cultrata, commonly known as the cutleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed or cut, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in early summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Saxifraga cultrata is valued for its frost resistance and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
