    "intro": "Sedum forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Sedum forrestii is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
