    "intro": "Saxifraga adscendens var. discolor, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in meadows and scree slopes. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or whitish underside, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in a dense cluster, and bloom in early summer. The species is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
