    "intro": "Salix spiraeifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender branches that hang in cascading streams, giving it a distinctive, graceful appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
