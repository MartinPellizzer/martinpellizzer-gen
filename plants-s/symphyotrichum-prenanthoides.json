It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and woodland edges. It produces showy purple to pinkish-red flowers in the late summer to early autumn, making it a valuable pollinator resource. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
