The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glossy coating. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in whorls, displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. Sauroglossum nitidum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
