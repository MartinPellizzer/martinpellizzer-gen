    "intro": "Salix amygdalina, commonly known as the white willow or weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkins and small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive white layer beneath, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its salicin content. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian zones."
