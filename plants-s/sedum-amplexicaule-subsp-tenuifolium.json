    "intro": "Sedum amplexicaule subsp. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often reddish in color and covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
