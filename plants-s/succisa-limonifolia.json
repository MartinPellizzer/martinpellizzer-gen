    "intro": "Succisa limonifolia, commonly known as lemonleaf or lemon tree, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to orange fruits resembling small lemons. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Succisa limonifolia is valued for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
