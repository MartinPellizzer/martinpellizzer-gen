It is characterized by its distinctive winged leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into berries. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its toxic properties, containing solanine and other alkaloids. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its berries are often mistaken for edible fruits, but they are poisonous and should not be consumed."
