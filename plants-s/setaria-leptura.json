    "intro": "Setaria leptura, commonly known as slender dropseed, is a grass species native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Setaria leptura plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
