    "intro": "Selaginella gracilis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Selaginella gracilis var. gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
