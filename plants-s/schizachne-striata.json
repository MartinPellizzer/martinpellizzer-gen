    "intro": "Schizachne striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass or striated grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves with distinct longitudinal stripes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Schizachne striata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
