    "intro": "Sclerocarpus multifidus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its arid habitat. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive success in challenging environments."
