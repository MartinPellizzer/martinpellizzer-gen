It typically features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Sitopsis species are often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may behave as annuals."
