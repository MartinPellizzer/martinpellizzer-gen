    "intro": "Silene nyctantha, commonly known as the night-flowering catchfly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that open at night. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Silene nyctantha is pollinated primarily by moths, which are active during the evening hours."
