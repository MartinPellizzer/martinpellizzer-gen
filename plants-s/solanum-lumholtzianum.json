    "intro": "Solanum lumholtzianum, commonly known as the lumholtz's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant bears berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing toxic compounds similar to those found in other nightshade species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
