    "intro": "Salvia elata, commonly known as tall blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia elata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
