It belongs to the family Synthlippaceae and is native to the arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. Its flowers are small, tubular, and often display a striking combination of purple and yellow hues. Synthlipsis densiflora is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is known for its resilience in extreme conditions."
