    "intro": "Sporobolus pseudairoides, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in drought conditions. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to purple in color. Blue grama is an important component of native grasslands and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
