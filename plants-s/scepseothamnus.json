    "intro": "Scepseothamnus, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a member of the Lamiaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale purple to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Scepseothamnus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
