    "intro": "Selaginella pyrrhopus, commonly known as the fire moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, scale-like leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color, giving it its common name. Selaginella pyrrhopus reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. This resilient plant is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
