    "intro": "Stapelia plicata, commonly known as the pleated stapelia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia plicata is a popular choice for collectors due to its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements."
