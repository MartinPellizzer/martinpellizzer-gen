    "intro": "Salix eriolepis, commonly known as the white willow or Japanese white willow, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
