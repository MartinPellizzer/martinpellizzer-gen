    "intro": "Sarcostemma torreyi, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sarcostemma torreyi is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system for accessing underground water sources."
