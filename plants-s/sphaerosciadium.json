    "intro": "Sphaerosciadium, commonly known as the globe sphaerosciadium, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spherical or globular inflorescences, which are a defining botanical feature. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or hairy surface, and their flowers are usually tubular with five lobes. Sphaerosciadium species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in botanical gardens and as houseplants."
