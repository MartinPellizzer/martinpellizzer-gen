    "intro": "Saxifraga subtsangchanensis, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on cliffs or among stones. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
