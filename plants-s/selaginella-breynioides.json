    "intro": "Selaginella breynioides, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and crevices, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
