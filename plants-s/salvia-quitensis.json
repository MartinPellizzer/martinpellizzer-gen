    "intro": "Salvia quitensis, commonly known as the Andean sage, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is adapted to cold, dry climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Salvia quitensis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
