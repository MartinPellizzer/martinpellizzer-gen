It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. It is characterized by its compact stature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of early successional plant communities."
