    "intro": "Stelis leinigii, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse conditions."
