    "intro": "Sciaphila lambirensis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique appearance includes pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its delicate nature and habitat loss, Sciaphila lambirensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
