    "intro": "Scheidweileria muricata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in wetland or swampy habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural environments."
