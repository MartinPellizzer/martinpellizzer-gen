It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as sugar substitutes. Stevia occidentalis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and modern natural health products."
