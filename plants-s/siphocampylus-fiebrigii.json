    "intro": "Siphocampylus fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiebrig's siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora and plant adaptation."
