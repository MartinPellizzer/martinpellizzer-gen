    "intro": "Stelis racemosa, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis racemosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
