    "intro": "Selaginella monospora subsp. trichophylla, commonly known as the trichophylla spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water retention mechanisms."
