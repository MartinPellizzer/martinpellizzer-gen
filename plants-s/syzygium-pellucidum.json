    "intro": "Syzygium pellucidum, commonly known as the white apple or white syzygium, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a glossy surface, while the fruit is a small, round drupe with a thin, smooth skin. Syzygium pellucidum is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its potential uses in traditional medicine."
