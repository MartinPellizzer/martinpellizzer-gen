    "intro": "Salix delavayana, commonly known as Delavay's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or riverine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
