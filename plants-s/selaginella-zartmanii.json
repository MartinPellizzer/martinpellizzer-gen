    "intro": "Selaginella zartmanii, commonly known as the Zartmann's spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its whorled leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobila. It is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive system involving both spores and seeds. Selaginella zartmanii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
