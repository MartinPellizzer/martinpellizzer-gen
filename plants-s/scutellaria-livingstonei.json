    "intro": "Scutellaria livingstonei, commonly known as Livingstone's blue flag, is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
