    "intro": "Scolopia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain scolopia, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scolopia oreophila is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
