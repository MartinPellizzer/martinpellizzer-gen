    "intro": "Saxifraga lyallii var. laxa, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh alpine environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
