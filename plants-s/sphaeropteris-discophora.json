    "intro": "Sphaeropteris discophora, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a member of the cycad family, Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being more compact and woody. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
