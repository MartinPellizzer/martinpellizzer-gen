    "intro": "Scaphocalyx, commonly known as the \"saddle-shaped calyx\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx, which is shaped like a saddle or a boat, giving it its scientific name. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often with five petals that are either white or pale in color. Scaphocalyx species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
