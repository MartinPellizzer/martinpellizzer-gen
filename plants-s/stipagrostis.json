    "intro": "Stipagrostis, commonly known as needlegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Stipagrostis species are characterized by their narrow, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. They often form dense vegetation cover, which helps prevent soil erosion in their native habitats. Many species are used for forage or in restoration projects due to their hardy nature."
