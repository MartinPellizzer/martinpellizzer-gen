    "intro": "Swietenia mahagoni var. praecociflora, commonly known as the early-flowering mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark red wood, which is highly valued for its durability and workability. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom earlier than the typical mahogany species, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. This variant is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its timber."
