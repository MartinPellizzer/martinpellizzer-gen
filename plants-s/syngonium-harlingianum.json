    "intro": "Syngonium harlingianum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that vary in color from solid green to variegated patterns of white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Syngonium harlingianum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
