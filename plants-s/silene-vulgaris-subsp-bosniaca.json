It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the temperate climate of its native range."
