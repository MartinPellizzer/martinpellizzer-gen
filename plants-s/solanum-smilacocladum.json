    "intro": "Solanum smilacocladum, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its twining stems that climb along other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Solanum smilacocladum is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
