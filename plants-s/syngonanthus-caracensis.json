    "intro": "Syngonanthus caracensis, commonly known as the Carac\u00e9s mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Syngonanthus caracensis is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in cloud forest or paramo ecosystems."
