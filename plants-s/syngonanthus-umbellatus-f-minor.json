    "intro": "Syngonanthus umbellatus f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella fern, is a compact, low-growing fern species native to tropical regions. It features delicate, arching fronds that form a dense, rounded foliage structure, giving it a lush, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases called sori on the underside of its leaves, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections."
