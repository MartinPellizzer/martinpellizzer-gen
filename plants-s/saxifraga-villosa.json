    "intro": "Saxifraga villosa, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in crevices and on rocky slopes. Saxifraga villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes."
