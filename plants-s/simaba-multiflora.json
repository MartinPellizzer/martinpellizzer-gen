    "intro": "Simaba multiflora, commonly known as the Florida mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
