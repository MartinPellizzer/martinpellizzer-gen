    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 frigolae, commonly known as the hybrid orchid orchis, is a fascinating plant that combines the characteristics of its parent species, Serapias grandiflora and Serapias sanguinea. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive veined pattern on the petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Serapias \u00d7 frigolae is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
