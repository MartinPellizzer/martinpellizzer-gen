    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or reddish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. This variety is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
