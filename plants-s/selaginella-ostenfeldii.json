    "intro": "Selaginella ostenfeldii, commonly known as the Ostenfeld's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with its leaves capable of rolling to reduce water loss. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Selaginella ostenfeldii is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
