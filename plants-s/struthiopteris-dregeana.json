    "intro": "Struthiopteris dregeana, commonly known as the Drege's shield fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
