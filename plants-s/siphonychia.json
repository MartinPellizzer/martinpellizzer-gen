    "intro": "Siphonychia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble holly berries, giving it its common name. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Siphonychia has narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to its salty, wind-swept environment. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
