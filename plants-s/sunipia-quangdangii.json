    "intro": "Sunipia quangdangii, commonly known as the Quangdang sunipia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
