    "intro": "Stachys parviflora, commonly known as narrowleaf hedge-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Stachys parviflora is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
