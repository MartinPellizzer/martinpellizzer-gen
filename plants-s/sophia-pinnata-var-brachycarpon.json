    "intro": "Sophia pinnata var. brachycarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sophia, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent pods that release seeds when mature. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
