    "intro": "Solenoruellia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their small, often showy flowers and woody stems. Solenoruellia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and some are valued for their aromatic wood. Due to overharvesting, several species are now threatened with extinction."
