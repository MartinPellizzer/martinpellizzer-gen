    "intro": "Saccharum insulare, commonly known as the island cane or dwarf sugarcane, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fibrous leaves. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pale green to reddish in color. Saccharum insulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in biofuel production."
