It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its aromatic leaves and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia scabrata is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
