    "intro": "Staphylea occidentalis, commonly known as the western bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Betulaceae, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, nut-like fruits. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by inflated, bladder-like seed pods that split open to release seeds. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
