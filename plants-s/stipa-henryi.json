    "intro": "Stipa henryi, commonly known as Henry's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed sites. Stipa henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
