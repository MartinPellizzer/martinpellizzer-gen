    "intro": "Scyphostelma ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian scyphostelma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
