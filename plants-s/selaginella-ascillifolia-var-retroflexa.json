    "intro": "Selaginella ascillifolia var. retroflexa, commonly known as the retroflex spore moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, or cone-like formations. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib and a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This variety is characterized by its unique spore morphology and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
