    "intro": "Salix hypoleuca f. trichorachis, commonly known as the silky willow, is a unique variant of the silky willow species characterized by its dense, soft, and hairy foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, flexible branches and small, oval leaves with a silvery-gray underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of wetland environments."
