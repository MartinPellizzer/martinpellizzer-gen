    "intro": "Sphaeritis subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. Sphaeritis subaphylla is typically found in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or meadow habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
