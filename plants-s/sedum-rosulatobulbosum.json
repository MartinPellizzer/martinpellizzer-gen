    "intro": "Sedum rosulatobulbosum, commonly known as the rosette-bulbous stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It forms dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in summer, typically arranged in a terminal cluster. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
