    "intro": "Salix reticulata f. villosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and slender, weeping branches. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination and seed dispersal. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a finely toothed margin and a silvery-white underside. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
