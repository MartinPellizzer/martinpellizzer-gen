    "intro": "Sesbania tetraptera subsp. tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged sesbania, is a leguminous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves with four pairs of oval leaflets and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fallow fields. Sesbania tetraptera is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
