    "intro": "Schumannia, commonly known as the giant lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. Schumannia species typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in cool, moist conditions. The leaves are usually broad and strap-like, forming a dense rosette at the base of the plant. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
