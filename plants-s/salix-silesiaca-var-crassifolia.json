    "intro": "Salix silesiaca var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow, is a variant of the Silesian willow native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects."
