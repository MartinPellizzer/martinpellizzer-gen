    "intro": "Schismatoglottis puncakborneensis, commonly known as the Bornean schismatoglottis, is a rare tropical plant native to the highlands of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, spatulate-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that includes a spurred labellum. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
