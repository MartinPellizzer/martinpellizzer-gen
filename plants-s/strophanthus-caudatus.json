    "intro": "Strophanthus caudatus, commonly known as the red-and-white milk vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and striking clusters of red and white tubular flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic cardiac glycosides, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Strophanthus caudatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant floral display."
