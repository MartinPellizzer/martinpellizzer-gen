    "intro": "Santalodes multiflorum, commonly known as the multiflorous sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and aromatic properties. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often arranged in clusters, and it produces small, winged seeds. The wood of Santalodes multiflorum is valued for its fragrance and is used in traditional incense and perfumery."
