It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant's bulbs are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Scadoxus multiflorus is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
