    "intro": "Salix mongolica var. yanbianica, commonly known as the Yanbian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
