    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon sagraeanum f. reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulate stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a reticulated venation pattern. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky outcrops. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest for both horticultural and conservation studies."
