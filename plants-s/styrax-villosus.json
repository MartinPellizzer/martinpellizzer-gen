    "intro": "Styrax villosus, commonly known as the woolly styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blossoms, making it a popular choice for gardens. Styrax villosus is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to various soil conditions."
