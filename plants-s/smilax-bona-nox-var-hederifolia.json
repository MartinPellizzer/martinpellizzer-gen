    "intro": "Smilax bona-nox var. hederifolia, commonly known as the creeping smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that can grow along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant has compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and it produces yellowish-green, spiny clusters of berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The berries are toxic to humans and livestock, making it an important plant to identify in natural habitats."
