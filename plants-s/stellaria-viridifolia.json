    "intro": "Stellaria viridifolia, commonly known as greenleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and slender, hairy stems. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a bluish-green hue, which contributes to its common name. Stellaria viridifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
