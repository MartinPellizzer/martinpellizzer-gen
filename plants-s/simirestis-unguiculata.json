It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable feature and has been used in traditional medicine. The plant is also an important source of nectar for pollinators such as bees and birds."
