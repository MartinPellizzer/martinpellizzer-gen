    "intro": "Sphaeromorphaea subintegra, commonly known as the smooth globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rounded thallus structure. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate forest environments. The plant's thallus is smooth and lacks distinct lobes, giving it a globular appearance. It contains a variety of secondary metabolites that contribute to its chemical complexity. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
