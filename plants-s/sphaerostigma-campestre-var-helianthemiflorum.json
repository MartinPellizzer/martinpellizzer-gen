    "intro": "Sphaerostigma campestre var. helianthemiflorum, commonly known as the golden sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The flowers are typically clustered in terminal spikes, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat."
