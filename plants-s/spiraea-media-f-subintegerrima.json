    "intro": "Spiraea media f. subintegerrima, commonly known as the smooth spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact size and seasonal blooms. This variety is more resistant to powdery mildew compared to other spiraea species, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscaping."
