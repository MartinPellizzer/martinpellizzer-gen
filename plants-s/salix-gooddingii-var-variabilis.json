    "intro": "Salix gooddingii var. variabilis, commonly known as the Goodding's willow variant, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
