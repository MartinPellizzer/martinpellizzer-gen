It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often twisted and have a unique, asymmetrical appearance. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered with remnants of old leaf bases. Its cones are typically borne on separate plants, with male and female cones occurring on different individuals. This cycad is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils."
