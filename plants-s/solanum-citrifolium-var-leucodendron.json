    "intro": "Solanum citrifolium var. leucodendron, commonly known as the whiteleaf nightshade, is a variant of the citrifolium species within the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its large, white or pale green leaves that contrast with its typically dark berries. The plant is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
