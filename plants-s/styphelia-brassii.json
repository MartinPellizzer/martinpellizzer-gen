    "intro": "Styphelia brassii, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the cool, humid forests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in spring, which are often clustered at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a compact rosette, typical of many Ericaceae species. Styphelia brassii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
