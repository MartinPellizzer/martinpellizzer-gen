    "intro": "Sporobolus diffusissimus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Sporobolus diffusissimus is often found in open habitats such as prairies, dunes, and disturbed areas."
