    "intro": "Symplocos chinensis var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with short, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a small, woody drupe. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value is due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting fruiting period."
