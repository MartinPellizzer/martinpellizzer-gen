    "intro": "Synthyris pinnatifida subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly synthyris, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its hairy, or lanuginous, appearance gives it its subspecies name and contributes to its unique botanical profile."
