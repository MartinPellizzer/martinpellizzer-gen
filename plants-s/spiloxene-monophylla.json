    "intro": "Spiloxene monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf spiloxene, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes ferns and their allies. The plant is characterized by its single, broad, leathery leaf that remains throughout the growing season. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spiloxene monophylla is considered an endangered species."
