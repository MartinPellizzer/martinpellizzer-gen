    "intro": "Sarcoclinium gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghostly appearance with white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant blooms that are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
