    "intro": "Stenotheca crepidisperma, commonly known as the narrow-cupped sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with capsules that release seeds when mature. Stenotheca crepidisperma plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations."
