    "intro": "Serpocaulon wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's serpocaulon, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizome and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, with a distinctive, serpentine appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serpocaulon wagneri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
