    "intro": "Salix pseudoaurita, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery-white down on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female, facilitating wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin, papery layers. The silver willow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
