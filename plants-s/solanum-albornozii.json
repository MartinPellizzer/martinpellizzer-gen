    "intro": "Solanum albornozii, commonly known as the Albornoz's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fruits are berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Solanum albornozii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
