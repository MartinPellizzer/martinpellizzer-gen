    "intro": "Spiesia caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with hairy, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes, making it an important species for coastal dune stabilization. Spiesia caespitosa is often found in open, sunny habitats along the coastline."
