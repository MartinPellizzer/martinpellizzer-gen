It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments.
