It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its adaptability to cold climates and drought resistance contribute to its popularity among gardeners in cooler regions."
