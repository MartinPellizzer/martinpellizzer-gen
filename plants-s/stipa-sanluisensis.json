    "intro": "Stipa sanluisensis, commonly known as the San Luis needlegrass, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Stipa sanluisensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
