    "intro": "Stixis scortechinii, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is known for its showy, bright yellow flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Stixis scortechinii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
