    "intro": "Strychnos hirsutiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red when mature, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy aril. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids. While it has ornamental value, it is generally avoided due to its potent and potentially harmful chemical composition."
