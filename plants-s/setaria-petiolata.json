    "intro": "Setaria petiolata, commonly known as rough false rice, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
