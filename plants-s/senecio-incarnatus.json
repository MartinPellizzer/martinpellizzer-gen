    "intro": "Senecio incarnatus, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of bright orange-red bracts that resemble poker chips, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the axils of the bracts, which bloom in summer. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, also known as the daisy or sunflower family. Senecio incarnatus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
