    "intro": "Siphocampylus dombeyanus, commonly known as the Dombey's siphocampylus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
