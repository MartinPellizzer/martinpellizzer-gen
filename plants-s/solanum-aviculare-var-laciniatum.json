    "intro": "Solanum aviculare var. laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. It produces berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption but is studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
