It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers, often in shades of yellow or orange, during the summer months. It is adapted to grow in rocky or arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container plantings."
