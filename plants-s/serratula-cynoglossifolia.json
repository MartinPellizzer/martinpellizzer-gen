    "intro": "Serratula cynoglossifolia, commonly known as the horse's tongue plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, tongue-shaped leaves that give it its common name, and it produces yellow to brown composite flowers. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Serratula cynoglossifolia is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in use."
