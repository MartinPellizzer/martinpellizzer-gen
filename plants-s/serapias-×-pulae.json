    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 pulae, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Serapias aubieriana and Serapias micrantha. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in the Mediterranean region. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
