    "intro": "Stipa neesiana var. ligularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces tall, feathery plumes of pale to dark brown flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in regions with mild climates."
