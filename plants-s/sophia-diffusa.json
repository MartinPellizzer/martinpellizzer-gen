    "intro": "Sophia diffusa, commonly known as the spreading sophia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that often branch out, giving it a diffuse appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. Sophia diffusa is often found in meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade."
