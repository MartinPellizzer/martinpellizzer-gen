    "intro": "Schweinfurthia pterosperma var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
