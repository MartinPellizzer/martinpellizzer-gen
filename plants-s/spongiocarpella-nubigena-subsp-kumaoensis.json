    "intro": "Spongiocarpella nubigena subsp. kumaoensis, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling spongefruit, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude, humid environments. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae and is characterized by its unique, sponge-like fruit structure that aids in moisture retention. The plant exhibits a climbing growth habit, often utilizing tree canopies in its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a hairy surface that provides additional insulation against cold temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its natural range."
