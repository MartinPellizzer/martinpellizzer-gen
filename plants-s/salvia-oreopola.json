    "intro": "Salvia oreopola, commonly known as the Sierra sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or dry garden environments. Salvia oreopola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
