    "intro": "Specklinia denticulata, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds with serrated edges. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Specklinia denticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
