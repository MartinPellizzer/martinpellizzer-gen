    "intro": "Sagittaria hirundinacea, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a flowering aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a triangular or arrowhead shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in summer. It thrives in shallow, wetland environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Sagittaria hirundinacea is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
