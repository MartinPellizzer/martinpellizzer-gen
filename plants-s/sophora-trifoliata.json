    "intro": "Sophora trifoliata, commonly known as the Chinese pagoda tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
