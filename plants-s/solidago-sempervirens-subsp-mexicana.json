    "intro": "Solidago sempervirens subsp. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are typically hairy as well. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites. Mexican goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late summer season."
