    "intro": "Schizachyrium brevifolium var. paradoxum, commonly known as the paradox grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of tan to brown. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in native plant gardens."
