    "intro": "[WRONG START] Steles columnaris, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, upright stem with clustered, small, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis columnaris is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
