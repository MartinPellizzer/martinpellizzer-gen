    "intro": "Sideroxylon novocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has simple, opposite, and usually elliptic leaves that are leathery in texture. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiky fruits. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
