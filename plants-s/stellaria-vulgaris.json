    "intro": "Stellaria vulgaris, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along paths. Stellaria vulgaris is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
