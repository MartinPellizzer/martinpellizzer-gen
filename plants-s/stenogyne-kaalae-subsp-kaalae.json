    "intro": "Stenogyne kaalae subsp. kaalae, commonly known as the Kaala heliotrope, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late winter and early spring. The plant is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and has small, opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforest understories and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native range. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
