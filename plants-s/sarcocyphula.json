    "intro": "Sarcocyphula, commonly known as the ghost cup, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Sarcoscyphaceae. These fungi are characterized by their unique, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that often have a ghostly or translucent appearance. They typically grow on decaying wood, especially in moist, shaded environments. The spore-producing structures are usually small and clustered, contributing to their elusive nature. Sarcocyphula species are of interest to mycologists due to their distinctive morphology and ecological role in decomposing organic matter."
