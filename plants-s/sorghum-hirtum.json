    "intro": "Sorghum hirtum, commonly known as bristle sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its rough, bristly foliage and panicles that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought. Its fibrous stalks are used for livestock feed and in traditional crafts. The seeds, when mature, are harvested for food and can be processed into flour or porridge."
