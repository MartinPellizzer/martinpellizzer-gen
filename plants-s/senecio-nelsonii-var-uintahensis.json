It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is known for its resilience and is often found in high-altitude regions of Utah and Colorado."
