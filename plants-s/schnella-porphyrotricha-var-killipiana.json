    "intro": "Schnella porphyrotricha var. killipiana, commonly known as the Killip's moss, is a variant of the broader Schnella porphyrotricha species. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, cushion-like growth form with dark green, wiry stems covered in leaf-like structures. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive porphyrotrichous arrangement of cells, giving the plant its specific epithet. This moss is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with high humidity and acidic soils."
