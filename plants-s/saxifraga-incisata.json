    "intro": "Saxifraga incisata, commonly known as the serrated saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often serrated or toothed, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer. Saxifraga incisata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
