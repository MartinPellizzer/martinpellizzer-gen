    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos semimetralis, commonly known as the semimetral starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and elliptical leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
