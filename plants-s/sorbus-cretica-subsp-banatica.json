    "intro": "Sorbus cretica subsp. banatica, commonly known as the Banat mountain whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous areas. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its environment."
