    "intro": "Saccharum elephantinum, commonly known as the giant cane or elephant grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable forage crop and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
