    "intro": "Saxifraga latina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Saxifraga latina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
