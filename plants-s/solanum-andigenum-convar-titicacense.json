    "intro": "Solanum andigenum convar. titicacense, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its woody stems, ovate leaves with serrated margins, and small, clustered flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural use."
