    "intro": "Salsola kali subsp. marginata, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of greenish-white flowers, which are typically short-lived and adapted for wind pollination. It is native to Eurasia but has been introduced to various parts of the world, often becoming an invasive species. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it a common weed in disturbed soils and agricultural areas."
