    "intro": "Scaphyglottis dariensis, commonly known as the Darien skyflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Scaphyglottis dariensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
