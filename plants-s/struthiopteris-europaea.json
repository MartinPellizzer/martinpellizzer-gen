    "intro": "Struthiopteris europaea, commonly known as the European royal fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
