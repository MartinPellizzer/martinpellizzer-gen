    "intro": "Sorbus tamamschjanae, commonly known as the Armenian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by round, red-orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters."
