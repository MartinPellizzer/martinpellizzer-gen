    "intro": "Silene davisii, commonly known as Davis's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Silene davisii has linear, hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
