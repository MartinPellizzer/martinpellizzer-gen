    "intro": "Salvinia minima var. gaillardiana, commonly known as the floating marsh fern, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to parts of the Americas and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and ditches. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting local aquatic ecosystems."
