    "intro": "Stellaria koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as carnations and chickweed. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Stellaria koelzii is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
