    "intro": "Sambucus orbiculata, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. The plant is notable for its bright red berries that ripen in the fall, which are edible when fully mature but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Sambucus orbiculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and wildlife."
