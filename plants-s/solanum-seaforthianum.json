    "intro": "Solanum seaforthianum, commonly known as the seaforth nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds in its berries and leaves."
