    "intro": "Stylocline acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has dense, compact growth habits that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Stylocline acaulis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine organisms."
