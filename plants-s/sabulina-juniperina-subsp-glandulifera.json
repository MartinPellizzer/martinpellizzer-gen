    "intro": "Sabulina juniperina subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular juniper saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are linear to narrowly elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are often covered with glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance and contributing to its common name. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
