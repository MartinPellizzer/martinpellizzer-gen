    "intro": "Sorbus americana subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as pomes, which are typically yellow or red in color and mature in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments."
