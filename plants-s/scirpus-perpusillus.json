    "intro": "Scirpus perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus perpusillus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
