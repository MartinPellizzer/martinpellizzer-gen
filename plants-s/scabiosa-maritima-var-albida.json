    "intro": "Scabiosa maritima var. albida, commonly known as the white coastal scabious, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe. It features slender stems covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs."
