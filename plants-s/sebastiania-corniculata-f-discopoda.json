    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata f. discopoda, commonly known as the disc-shaped sebastiania, is a rare variant of the species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, disc-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
