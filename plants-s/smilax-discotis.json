It is characterized by its spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Smilax discotis is often found in moist woodlands and thickets, thriving in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
