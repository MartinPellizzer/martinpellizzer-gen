    "intro": "Spergularia melanocaulos, commonly known as the black-stemmed sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Spergularia melanocaulos is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
