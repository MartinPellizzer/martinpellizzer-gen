    "intro": "Specklinia pellifeloidis, commonly known as the yellow-veined staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically divided into segments, with a distinctive yellow vein pattern that gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity for optimal growth."
