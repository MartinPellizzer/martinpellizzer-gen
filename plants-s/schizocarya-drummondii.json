    "intro": "Schizocarya drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's schizocarya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and palmate leaves that are often hairy. It produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Schizocarya drummondii is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots and a slow growth rate to conserve water."
