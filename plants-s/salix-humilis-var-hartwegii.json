    "intro": "Salix humilis var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils or along streambanks. This variant is notable for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
