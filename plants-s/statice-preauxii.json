    "intro": "Statice preauxii, commonly known as the purple gull or sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences, and the leaves are narrow and linear. Statice preauxii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
