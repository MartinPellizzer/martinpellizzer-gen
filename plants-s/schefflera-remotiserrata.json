    "intro": "Schefflera remotiserrata, commonly known as the remote serrate schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and compound leaves that are divided into multiple leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
