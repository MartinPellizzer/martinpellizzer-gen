    "intro": "Sarcanthus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging or trailing milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Sarcanthus pendulus is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes other milkweeds known for their toxic sap and ecological importance to certain insect species."
