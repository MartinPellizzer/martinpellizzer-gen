    "intro": "Spatalla bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive seed capsules. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming a dense mat that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Spatalla bolusii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
