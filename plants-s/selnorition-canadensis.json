    "intro": "Selnorition canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian selnorition, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens to support local pollinators."
