    "intro": "Symphytum officinale var. calycinum, commonly known as the Armenian cowpea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features rosettes of broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its name derives from the Greek \"symphyton,\" meaning \"growing together,\" referring to the way its leaves and stems fuse at the base."
