    "intro": "Senecio ravidus, commonly known as the Woolly Senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its soft, woolly leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio ravidus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
