    "intro": "Semiaquilegia henryi, commonly known as Henry's semiaquilegia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
