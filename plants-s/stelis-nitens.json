    "intro": "Stelis nitens, commonly known as the bright-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features striking white or pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically small and white, with a delicate fragrance that attracts pollinators. Stelis nitens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
