    "intro": "Selaginella selangorensis, commonly known as the Selangor spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are often a dark green color. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tip of the stem and produce spores. Selaginella selangorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
