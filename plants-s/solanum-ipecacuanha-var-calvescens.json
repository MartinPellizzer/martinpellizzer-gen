    "intro": "Solanum ipecacuanha var. calvescens, commonly known as Brazilian ipecac, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berry-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of ipecacuanha alkaloids, which have been used historically in treating respiratory conditions. However, it is toxic if ingested in large quantities and requires careful handling."
