    "intro": "Stylidium javanicum, commonly known as the Java sun-orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia and Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features a distinctive, spurred flower with a bright yellow corolla and a long, slender nectar spur. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Stylidium javanicum is adapted to arid conditions, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils."
