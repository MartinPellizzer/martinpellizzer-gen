    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
