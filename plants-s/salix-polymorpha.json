    "intro": "Salix polymorpha, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The tree produces catkins as its flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Salix polymorpha is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
