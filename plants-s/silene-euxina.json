    "intro": "Silene euxina, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces striking pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Silene euxina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
