    "intro": "Selaginella martensii var. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its creeping, stoloniferous growth habit and its ability to form dense mats. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the branches. This variety is known for its resilience and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
