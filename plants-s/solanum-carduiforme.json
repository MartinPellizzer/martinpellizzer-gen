    "intro": "Solanum carduiforme, commonly known as the heart-shaped nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
