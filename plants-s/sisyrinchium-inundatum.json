    "intro": "Sisyrinchium inundatum, commonly known as the water blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are typically 5- to 7-petaled and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sisyrinchium inundatum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
