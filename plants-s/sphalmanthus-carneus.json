    "intro": "Sphalmanthus carneus, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its thick, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are known for their ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
