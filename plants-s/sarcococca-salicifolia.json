    "intro": "Sarcococca salicifolia, commonly known as the fragrant winterberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late winter, followed by red berries that persist into spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its winter interest and adaptability make it a valuable addition to diverse garden settings."
