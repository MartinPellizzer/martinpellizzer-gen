    "intro": "Saponaria acerosa, commonly known as the hardy soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Saponaria acerosa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy garden plant. Its sap contains saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water, hence its common name."
