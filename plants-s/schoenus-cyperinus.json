    "intro": "Schoenus cyperinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as wetlands and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Schoenus cyperinus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
