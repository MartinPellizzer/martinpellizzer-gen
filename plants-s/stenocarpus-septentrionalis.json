    "intro": "Stenocarpus septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern hakea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
