    "intro": "Sedum arenarium, commonly known as desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in sandy soils. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
