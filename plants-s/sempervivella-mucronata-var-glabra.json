    "intro": "Sempervivella mucronata var. glabra, commonly known as the naked stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used as a ground cover in arid environments."
