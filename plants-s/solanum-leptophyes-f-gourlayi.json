    "intro": "Solanum leptophyes f. gourlayi, commonly known as the Gourlay's nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to specific regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
