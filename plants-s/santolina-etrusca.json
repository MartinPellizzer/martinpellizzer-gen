    "intro": "Santolina etrusca, commonly known as Etruscan santolina, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are aromatic, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental value. Santolina etrusca is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and drought tolerance."
