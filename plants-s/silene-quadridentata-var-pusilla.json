    "intro": "Silene quadridentata var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf four-toothed catchfly, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and often grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its succulent stems and showy floral displays. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
