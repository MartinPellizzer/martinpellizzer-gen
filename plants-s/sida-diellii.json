    "intro": "Sida diellii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Sida diellii is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
