    "intro": "Selaginella canaliculata var. robusta, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces spore-bearing strobila, or cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
