    "intro": "Salsola masenderanica, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its role in stabilizing sandy soils. Salsola masenderanica is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or medicinal purposes."
