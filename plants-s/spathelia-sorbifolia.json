It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are often obscured by the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of its native habitat."
