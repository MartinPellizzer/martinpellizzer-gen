It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its fruit is a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
