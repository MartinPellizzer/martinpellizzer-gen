    "intro": "Schubertia nucifera, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces coconuts, which are encased in a hard outer shell and contain both water and milk. Schubertia nucifera is well adapted to coastal and tropical environments, often growing near beaches and in humid climates. Its versatility makes it an economically and culturally significant plant in many parts of the world."
