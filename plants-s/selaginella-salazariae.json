    "intro": "Selaginella salazariae, commonly known as the Salazara Spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to South America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features upright, spiky stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella salazariae is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
