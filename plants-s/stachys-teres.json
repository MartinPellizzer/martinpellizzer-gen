    "intro": "Stachys teres, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Stachys teres is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
