    "intro": "Spathelia pinetorum var. megaphylla, commonly known as the giant-leaf pine orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy, and often fragrant floral bracts that can reach several inches in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in the humid, shaded environment. This variant is distinguished by its significantly larger leaf size compared to other varieties within the Spathelia genus."
