    "intro": "Symplocos dasyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leafed wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white, fragrant flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are typically thick, leathery, and have a rough texture, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats."
