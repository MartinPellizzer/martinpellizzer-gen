    "intro": "Scilla kladnii, commonly known as the Balkan squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are toxic and contain cardiac glycosides, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. Scilla kladnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
