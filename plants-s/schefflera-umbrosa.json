    "intro": "Schefflera umbrosa, commonly known as the dark schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with shades of yellow or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas. Schefflera umbrosa is valued for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
