    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 baregensis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga \u00d7 baregensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
