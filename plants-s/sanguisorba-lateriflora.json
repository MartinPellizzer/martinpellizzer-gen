    "intro": "Sanguisorba lateriflora, commonly known as the redroot filaree, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and have been used historically in traditional medicine. Sanguisorba lateriflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
