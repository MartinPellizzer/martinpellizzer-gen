    "intro": "Senecio lugens var. ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
