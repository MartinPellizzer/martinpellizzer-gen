    "intro": "Scholtzia halophila subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
