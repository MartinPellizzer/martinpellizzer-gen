It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is a perennial herb that produces small, oval fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
