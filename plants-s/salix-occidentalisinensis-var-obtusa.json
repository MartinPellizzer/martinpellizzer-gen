It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
