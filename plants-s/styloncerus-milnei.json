    "intro": "Styloncerus milnei, commonly known as the milne's styloncerus, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae, commonly referred to as longhorn beetles. It is characterized by its elongated body and prominent antennae, which are typical features of the family. The beetle is primarily found in forested regions, where it plays a role in the decomposition of woody material. Its life cycle involves larvae that feed on decaying wood, contributing to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often associated with old-growth forests and is considered an indicator species for forest health."
