    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris subsp. duvalii, commonly known as the Duval's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering stems that rise from a network of rhizomes, which help anchor it in muddy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water repellence and reducing transpiration. This subspecies is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other shallow water areas, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
