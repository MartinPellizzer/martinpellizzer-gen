    "intro": "Stelis membranacea, commonly known as the membranous stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually thin and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
