    "intro": "Stegnogramma griffithii var. wilfordii, commonly known as the Wilford's stegnogramma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with striking yellow-orange petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a subtle veining pattern that enhances its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
