    "intro": "Salix songarica, commonly known as the Songarica willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it is often found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. Salix songarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
