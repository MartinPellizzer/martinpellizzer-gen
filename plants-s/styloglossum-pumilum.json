It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance."
