    "intro": "Senecio modestus var. candollei, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with soft, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
