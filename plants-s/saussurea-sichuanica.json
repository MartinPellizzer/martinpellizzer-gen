    "intro": "Saussurea sichuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in China. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Tibetan Plateau. Its roots are valued in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
