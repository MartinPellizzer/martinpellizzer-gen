    "intro": "Saurauia perseifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to retain moisture in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in shady areas."
