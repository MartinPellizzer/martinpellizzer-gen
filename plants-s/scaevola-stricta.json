    "intro": "Scaevola stricta, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year, particularly in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea breezes and sandy soils. Scaevola stricta is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
