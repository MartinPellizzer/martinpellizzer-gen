    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. ornata, commonly known as the yellow trumpet pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps to capture insects. The plant's flowers are typically red or orange, with a distinctive yellow throat, adding to its ornamental appeal. The varietal form 'ornata' is distinguished by its more vibrant coloration and slightly different leaf shape compared to the typical form. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
