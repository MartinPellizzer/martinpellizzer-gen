    "intro": "Scutellaria wulingshanensis, commonly known as the Wulingshan skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
