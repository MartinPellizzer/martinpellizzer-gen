    "intro": "Selaginella distachya, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and distinctive spore-bearing structures. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and ferns. Its leaves are arranged in whorls and produce two types of spores, which are released from specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella distachya is also known for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
