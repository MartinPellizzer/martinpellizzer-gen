    "intro": "Santalum lanceolatum var. venosum, commonly known as the veiny sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that derives some of its nutrients from neighboring plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves with prominent venation patterns, which give it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by woody, aromatic capsules that contain its seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
