    "intro": "Solanum trongum var. tongdongense, commonly known as the Tongdong wild tomato, is a perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other solanum species. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and is adapted to thrive in shaded conditions. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
