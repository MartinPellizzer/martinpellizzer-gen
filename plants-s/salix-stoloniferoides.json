    "intro": "Salix stoloniferoides, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic flora and fauna."
