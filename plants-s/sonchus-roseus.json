    "intro": "Sonchus roseus, commonly known as the roseleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, oblanceolate leaves with a wavy margin and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from early summer to autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is prostrate to upright, depending on environmental conditions, and it often forms dense mats in disturbed soils. Sonchus roseus is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
