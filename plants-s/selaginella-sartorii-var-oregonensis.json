    "intro": "Selaginella sartorii var. oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in whorls around the stems. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its sporophyte stage produces spore capsules that are clustered in cones, a characteristic feature of the spikemoss family. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
