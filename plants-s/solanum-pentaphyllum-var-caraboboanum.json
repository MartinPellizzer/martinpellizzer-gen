It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, white or purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, often found in humid, tropical environments. It produces small, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but may serve as food for certain wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
