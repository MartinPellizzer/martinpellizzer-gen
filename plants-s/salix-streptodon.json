    "intro": "Salix streptodon, commonly known as the red-osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems that become more pronounced in winter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in the fall. Salix streptodon is well adapted to wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
