    "intro": "Sempervivum album, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Alps and surrounding regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces upright flowering stems with clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
