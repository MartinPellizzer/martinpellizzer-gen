    "intro": "Silene pomelii subsp. adusta, commonly known as the dusty silene, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The subspecies adusta is distinguished by its more intensely colored flowers and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Silene pomelii."
