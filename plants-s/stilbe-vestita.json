    "intro": "Stilbe vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Stilbe vestita is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and aquatic organisms."
