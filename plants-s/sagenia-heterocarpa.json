    "intro": "Sagenia heterocarpa, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Sagenia heterocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
