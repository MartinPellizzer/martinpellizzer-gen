    "intro": "Sedum erectum, commonly known as upright stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun. Sedum erectum is a low-maintenance plant that is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
