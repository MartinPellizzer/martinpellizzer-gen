It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically small and clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
