    "intro": "Salsola sclerantha var. carinata, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Salsola sclerantha var. carinata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
