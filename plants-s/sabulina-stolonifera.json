    "intro": "Sabulina stolonifera, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. The plant forms dense cushions or mats through its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Sabulina stolonifera plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is an indicator species for cold climates."
