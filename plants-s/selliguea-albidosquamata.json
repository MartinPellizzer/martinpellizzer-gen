    "intro": "Selliguea albidosquamata, commonly known as the white-squamate moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with pale green to whitish thallus covered in small, scale-like structures called squamules. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores for dispersal. Selliguea albidosquamata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecological niche."
