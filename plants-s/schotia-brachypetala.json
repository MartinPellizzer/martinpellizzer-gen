    "intro": "Schotia brachypetala, commonly known as the dwarf silver tree, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for coastal environments. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, with a distinctive scent when crushed. Schotia brachypetala is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in saline conditions."
