    "intro": "Swartzia panacoco, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several elliptical seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
