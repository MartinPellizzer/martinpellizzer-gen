    "intro": "Styphelia macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in shaded forest environments. Its small, leathery leaves and clustered inflorescences are adaptations to its cool, moist habitat. Styphelia macrocalyx is often found in pine and hardwood forests, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
