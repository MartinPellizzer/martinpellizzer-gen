    "intro": "Stenostephanus thyrsoides, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Ericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
