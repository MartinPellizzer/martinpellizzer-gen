    "intro": "Stellaria spatulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The leaves are characterized by their spoon-shaped or spatulate form, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This species is often found in the understory of forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
