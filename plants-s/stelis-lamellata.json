    "intro": "Stelis lamellata, commonly known as the lace orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Stelis lamellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
