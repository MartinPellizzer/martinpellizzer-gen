    "intro": "Schizachyrium sulcatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass that thrives in prairie and savanna habitats. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature to a rusty brown color, typically in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Little bluestem is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
