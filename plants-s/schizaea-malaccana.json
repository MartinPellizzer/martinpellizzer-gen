    "intro": "Schizaea malaccana, commonly known as the Malacca clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its wiry, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. Schizaea malaccana reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This ancient plant exhibits features reminiscent of early vascular plants and is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution."
