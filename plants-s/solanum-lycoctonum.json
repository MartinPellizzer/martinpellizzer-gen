    "intro": "Solanum lycoctonum, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a perennial shrub that produces dark purple berries which are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. The plant has alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a rough texture and hairy surfaces. Its flowers are typically bell-shaped, with yellow stamens and a violet or purple corolla. Historically, it has been used in medicine and witchcraft, though its potent toxicity makes it a dangerous plant to handle."
