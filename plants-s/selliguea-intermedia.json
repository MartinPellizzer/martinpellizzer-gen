    "intro": "Selliguea intermedia, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. The plant has a dense, leafy structure with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are borne on stalks and produce spores for propagation. Selliguea intermedia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
