    "intro": "Scirpus obtuse-trigonus, commonly known as the broad-angled bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular, solid stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and its roots form extensive rhizomes that help stabilize soil in marshy areas. Scirpus obtuse-trigonus is often found in shallow water or moist soils, contributing to the ecological structure of wetland habitats."
