    "intro": "Solanum boquetense, commonly known as the Bouquet's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum boquetense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
