    "intro": "Salix cyllenea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups of three, a distinctive feature of the Salix genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
