    "intro": "Spiranthes eugenii, commonly known as the Eugenia spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it in the soil and supports its growth. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and moths, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
