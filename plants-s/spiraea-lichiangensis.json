    "intro": "Spiraea lichiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant features slender, arching branches and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in the fall. Spiraea lichiangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
