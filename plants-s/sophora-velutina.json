    "intro": "Sophora velutina, commonly known as the velvet tamarack, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
