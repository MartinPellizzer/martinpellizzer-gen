It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap and opposite leaves. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine.
