    "intro": "Sapium dichotomum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It features opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by orange to red berries that contain one or two seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. The tree's bark is smooth and gray, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall."
