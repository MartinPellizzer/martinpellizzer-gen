It is characterized by its striking, snake-like appearance, with long, curling stems that resemble a serpent. The plant produces small, fragrant orchid-like flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
