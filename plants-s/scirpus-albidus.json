    "intro": "Scirpus albidus, commonly known as the white bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of white, fluffy flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus albidus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
