    "intro": "Saxifraga demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the wet season, typically between October and December. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
