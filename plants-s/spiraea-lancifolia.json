    "intro": "Spiraea lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Spiraea lancifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
