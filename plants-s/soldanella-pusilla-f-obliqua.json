    "intro": "Soldanella pusilla f. obliqua, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a small, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often inclined at an angle, giving it its specific epithet \"obliqua.\" It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
