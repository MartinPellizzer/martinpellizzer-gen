It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange to red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
