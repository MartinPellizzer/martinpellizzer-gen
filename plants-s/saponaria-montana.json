    "intro": "Saponaria montana, commonly known as the mountain soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are narrower and more elongated. Its roots contain saponins, which give the plant its common name and contribute to its historical use in soap-making. Saponaria montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
