    "intro": "Schoenus latitans, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across shallow water and moist soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences of spikelets. Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Schoenus latitans plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
