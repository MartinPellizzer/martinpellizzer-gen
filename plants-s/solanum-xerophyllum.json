    "intro": "Solanum xerophyllum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features include a woody stem, glandular hairs, and a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Solanum xerophyllum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
