    "intro": "Smyrnium ramosum, commonly known as the hairy cowbane, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, ribbed fruit that aids in wind dispersal. Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
