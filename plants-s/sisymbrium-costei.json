    "intro": "Sisymbrium costei, commonly known as the narrowleaf shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and lobed. Sisymbrium costei is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its seeds are small and dry, dispersing easily by wind, which contributes to its widespread distribution."
