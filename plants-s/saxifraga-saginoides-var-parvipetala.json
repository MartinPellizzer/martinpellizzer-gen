    "intro": "Saxifraga saginoides var. parvipetala, commonly known as the small-petaled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate petals compared to the typical form of Saxifraga saginoides."
