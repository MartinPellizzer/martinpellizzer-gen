    "intro": "Salix roylei, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. Salix roylei is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
