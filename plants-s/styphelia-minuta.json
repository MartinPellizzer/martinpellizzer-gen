    "intro": "Styphelia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeastern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Styphelia minuta thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
