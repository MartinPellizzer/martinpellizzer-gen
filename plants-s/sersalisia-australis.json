    "intro": "Sersalisia australis, commonly known as the Australian serpentine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in serpentine soils, which are nutrient-poor and rich in heavy metals, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense clumps. Sersalisia australis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
