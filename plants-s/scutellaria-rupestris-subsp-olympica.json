    "intro": "Scutellaria rupestris subsp. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features upright stems with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular blue or violet flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
