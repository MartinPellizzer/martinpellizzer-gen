    "intro": "Sideroxylon socorrense, commonly known as the Socorro ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
