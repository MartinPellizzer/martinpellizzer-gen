    "intro": "Smilax spinosa var. ovata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed devil's backbone, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody, thornless stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing or trailing along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a smooth texture, distinguishing it from other smilax varieties. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and thickets."
