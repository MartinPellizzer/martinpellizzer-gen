    "intro": "Setaria setosa var. vulpiseta, commonly known as fox tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, stiff, bristly inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of florets. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
