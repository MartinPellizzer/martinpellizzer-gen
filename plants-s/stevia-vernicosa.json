    "intro": "Stevia vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves covered in a waxy, glossy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. Stevia vernicosa is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its medicinal properties."
