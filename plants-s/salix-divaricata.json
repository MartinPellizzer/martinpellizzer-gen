    "intro": "Salix divaricata, commonly known as the red-osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red twigs that are prominent in winter. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring. Salix divaricata is often used in wetland restoration due to its ability to thrive in moist soils."
