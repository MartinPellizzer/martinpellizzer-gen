    "intro": "Saribus tothur, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender tree native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It features a fibrous, hairy trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 4 meters. The plant produces a distinctive, three-lobed fruit that contains a hard, inner shell with a white, fleshy mesocarp. The coconut palm is well-adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its various parts, including the fruit, leaves, and trunk, have numerous uses in food, construction, and traditional medicine."
