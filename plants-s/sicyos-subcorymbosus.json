    "intro": "Sicyos subcorymbosus, commonly known as the desert bottle gourd, is a climbing vine native to arid regions of the Americas. It produces large, hollow, bottle-shaped fruits that can store water, a key adaptation to its dry environment. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
