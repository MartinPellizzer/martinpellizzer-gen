    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus f. runcinatus, commonly known as the curlyleaf sowthistle, is a variant of the common sowthistle. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its finely divided, curly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a weed and a potential forage plant in certain regions."
