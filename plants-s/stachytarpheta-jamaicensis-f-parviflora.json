It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes in warm climates."
