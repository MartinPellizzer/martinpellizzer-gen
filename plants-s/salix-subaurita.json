    "intro": "Salix subaurita, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its early spring foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The silver willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
