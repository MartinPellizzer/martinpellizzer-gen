    "intro": "Salpichroa foetida, commonly known as the stinkweed or smelly weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. One of its most notable characteristics is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the plant is crushed. This odor is believed to be a defense mechanism against herbivores and pests."
