    "intro": "Sarcochilus fraternus, commonly known as the Brother's Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a pseudobulb with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that is often hairy. The plant produces a single, curved inflorescence bearing several pale green to brownish flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in damp, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
