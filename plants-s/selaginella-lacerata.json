    "intro": "Selaginella lacerata, commonly known as the basket fern or zigzag spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its sporophylls are closely arranged and bear microsporangia and megasporangia, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella lacerata is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
