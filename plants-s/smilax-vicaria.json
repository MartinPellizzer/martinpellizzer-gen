    "intro": "Smilax vicaria, commonly known as the trailing smilax, is a vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, spiny tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinctive waxy coating. Smilax vicaria is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
