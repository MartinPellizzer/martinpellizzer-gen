    "intro": "Scirpus uniglumis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, typically found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically important in aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat that provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. The common bulrush plays a vital role in water filtration and supports biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
