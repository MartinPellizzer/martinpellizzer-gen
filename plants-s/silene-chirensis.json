    "intro": "Silene chirensis, commonly known as the Chiru's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silene chirensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
