    "intro": "Sedum acre var. spirale, commonly known as the spiral stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping."
