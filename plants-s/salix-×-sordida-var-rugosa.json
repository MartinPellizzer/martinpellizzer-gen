    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sordida var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its stout, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch due to their dense pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a notable species in ecological studies of cold climates."
