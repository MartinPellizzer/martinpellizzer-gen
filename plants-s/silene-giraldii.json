    "intro": "Silene giraldii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada silene, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene giraldii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
