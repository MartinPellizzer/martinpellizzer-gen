    "intro": "Salsola kali subsp. tragus, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a distinctive appearance with spiny, lobed leaves and small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It is a perennial species, capable of surviving in harsh conditions due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. The subspecies tragus is characterized by its more robust growth and the presence of stiff, bristle-like structures on its stems and leaves."
