    "intro": "Saponaria struthium, commonly known as the meadow soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Saponaria struthium is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its name derives from the saponin compounds found in its roots, which produce a soapy lather when crushed."
