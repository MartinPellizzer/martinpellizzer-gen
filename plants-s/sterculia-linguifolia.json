    "intro": "Sterculia linguifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed sterculia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
