    "intro": "Senecio antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio antioquensis is noted for its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators."
