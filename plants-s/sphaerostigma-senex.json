It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, pendant-like flowers that resemble small, dangling beads. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Sphaerostigma senex is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. Its botanical features make it a unique and interesting subject for study in both horticulture and botany."
