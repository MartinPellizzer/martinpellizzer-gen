    "intro": "Salix cordata var. balsamifera, commonly known as the Balsam Poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, fragrant bark that exudes a balsam-like scent when crushed. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
