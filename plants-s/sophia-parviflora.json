    "intro": "Sophia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sophia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native habitat."
