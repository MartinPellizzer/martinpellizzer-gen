It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
