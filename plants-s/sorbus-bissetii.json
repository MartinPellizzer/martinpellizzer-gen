The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
