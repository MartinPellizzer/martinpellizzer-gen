    "intro": "Solanum havanense, commonly known as the Havana nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thick, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are usually red when ripe. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in sandy or limestone soils."
