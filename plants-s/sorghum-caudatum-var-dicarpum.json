    "intro": "Sorghum caudatum var. dicarpum, commonly known as the two-seeded sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, feathery panicles that produce numerous small, two-seeded spikelets. The plant thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib, and it produces both male and female inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a landscape plant."
