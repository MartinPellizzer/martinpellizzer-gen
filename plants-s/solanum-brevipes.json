    "intro": "Solanum brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum brevipes is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
