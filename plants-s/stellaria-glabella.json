    "intro": "Stellaria glabella, commonly known as the smooth starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features a prostrate or ascending stem covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Stellaria glabella is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist environments."
