    "intro": "Solanum pentlandii subsp. interandinum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a bright red, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other solanum species. It is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes, and is known for its ornamental value and medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
