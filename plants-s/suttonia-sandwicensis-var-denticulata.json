    "intro": "Suttonia sandwicensis var. denticulata, commonly known as the Hawaiian denticulate suttonia, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on the edges of rainforests. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this variety is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique adaptations and ecological role."
