    "intro": "Seticereus humboldtii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, adapting it to arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are active during the night."
