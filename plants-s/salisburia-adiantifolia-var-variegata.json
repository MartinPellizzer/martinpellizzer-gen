    "intro": "Salisburia adiantifolia var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated salisburia, is a rare and unique plant native to the humid forests of southern China. It belongs to the Salisburia genus, which is closely related to cycads, and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage. The variegated form exhibits striking color variations, with white and yellow markings on its leaves, enhancing its ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
