    "intro": "Schelhammera multiflora, commonly known as the multibract fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schelhammera multiflora is considered a vulnerable species."
