It is characterized by its smooth, hairless bark and slender, weeping branches. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall."
