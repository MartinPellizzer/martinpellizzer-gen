    "intro": "Stipa teretifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa teretifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
