    "intro": "Senegalia lowei, commonly known as the Texas screwbean, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, spindly growth habit and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has small, pale green leaves and produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped landscapes. Senegalia lowei plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
