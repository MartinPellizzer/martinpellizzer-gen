    "intro": "Scirpus congdonii, commonly known as Congdon's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Scirpus congdonii plays a role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
