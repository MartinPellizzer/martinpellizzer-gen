    "intro": "Salix morelii, commonly known as the Morel willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate to cold climates. Salix morelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
