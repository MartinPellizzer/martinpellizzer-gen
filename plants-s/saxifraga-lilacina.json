    "intro": "Saxifraga lilacina, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga lilacina is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
