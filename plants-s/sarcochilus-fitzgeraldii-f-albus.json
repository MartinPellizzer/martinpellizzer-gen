    "intro": "Sarcochilus fitzgeraldii f. albus, commonly known as the White Fitzgerald's Sarcochilus, is a rare and striking orchid native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native region."
