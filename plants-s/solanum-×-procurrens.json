It features small, egg-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant bears small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between Solanum carolinense and Solanum villosum."
