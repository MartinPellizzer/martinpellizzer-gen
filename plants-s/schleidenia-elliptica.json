It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in racemes during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Schleidenia elliptica is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun."
