    "intro": "Smilax stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf catbrier, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to cling to trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Smilax stenophylla is often found in moist, wooded areas and is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
