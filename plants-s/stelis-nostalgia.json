    "intro": "[WRONG START] Steles nostalgia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
