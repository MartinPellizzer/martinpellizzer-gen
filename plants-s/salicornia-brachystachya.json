    "intro": "Salicornia brachystachya, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. It is a succulent annual that forms dense, erect clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is well-known for its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations and thrive in arid conditions. Salicornia brachystachya is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological importance and resilience."
