    "intro": "Sorbus concavifolia, commonly known as the concaveleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5 to 7 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, apple-like berries that ripen to a dark red or black color. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
