    "intro": "Selaginella subvaginata, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats, and it produces cone-like structures called strobila for reproduction. Selaginella subvaginata is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
