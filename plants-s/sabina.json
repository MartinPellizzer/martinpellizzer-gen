    "intro": "Sabina, commonly known as the juniper, is a genus of evergreen coniferous shrubs or small trees belonging to the family Cupressaceae. These plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and small, scale-like foliage, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. Sabina species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in rocky or mountainous areas. They produce small, berry-like cones that contain aromatic, toxic seeds. The wood of Sabina is durable and has been historically used for construction and as a source of essential oils."
