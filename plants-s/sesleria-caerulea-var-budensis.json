    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea var. budensis, commonly known as the blue tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
