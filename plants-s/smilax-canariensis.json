    "intro": "Smilax canariensis, commonly known as the Canary climbing plant, is a perennial vine native to the Canary Islands and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a rough texture and are often used in traditional medicine. Smilax canariensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
