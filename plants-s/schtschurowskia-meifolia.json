    "intro": "Schtschurowskia meifolia, commonly known as the Meifolium orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces intricate, spurred petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schtschurowskia meifolia is considered a vulnerable species."
