    "intro": "Sulcorebutia oligacantha, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dark green, ribbed stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Sulcorebutia oligacantha is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
