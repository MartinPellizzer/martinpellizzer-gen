    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Pennsylvania saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as woodland edges and rocky outcrops. The plant features a dense mat of fleshy, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in early spring, adding delicate floral interest. This variety is distinguished by its hairy texture and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
