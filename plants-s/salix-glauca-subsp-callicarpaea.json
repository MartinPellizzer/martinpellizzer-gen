    "intro": "Salix glauca subsp. callicarpaea, commonly known as the gray willow or narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones."
