    "intro": "Streptopus amplexifolius var. genuinus, commonly known as the broad-leaf starwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the Stellariaceae family."
