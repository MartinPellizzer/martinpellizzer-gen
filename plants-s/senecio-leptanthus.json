It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Senecio leptanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
