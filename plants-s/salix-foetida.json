    "intro": "Salix foetida, commonly known as the foul-smelling willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, especially when the leaves are crushed. Salix foetida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
