    "intro": "Saurauia oreophila f. rubra, commonly known as the red-fruited stonecrop, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soils, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
