    "intro": "Solidago hispida var. tonsa, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, hairy stems that give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often covered in fine hairs. Stiff goldenrod is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
