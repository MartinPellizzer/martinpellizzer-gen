    "intro": "Salix eriocephala var. mackenzieana, commonly known as Mackenzie's willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of seed dispersal, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions and is an important component of polar ecosystems."
