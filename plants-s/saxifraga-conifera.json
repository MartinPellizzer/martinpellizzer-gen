    "intro": "Saxifraga conifera, commonly known as the pine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Saxifraga conifera thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its resilience to extreme temperatures makes it a notable species in ecological studies of cold climates."
