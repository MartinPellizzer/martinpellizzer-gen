    "intro": "Saxifraga trinervia, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically elliptic or ovate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga trinervia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
