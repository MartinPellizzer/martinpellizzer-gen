    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urda-net orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to Venezuela. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a dense cluster. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
