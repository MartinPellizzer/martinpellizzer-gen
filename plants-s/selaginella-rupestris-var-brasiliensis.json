    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are arranged in clusters. Selaginella rupestris var. brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
