    "intro": "Selaginella mariesii, commonly known as the Mary's spikemoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of North America. It possesses a distinctive morphology with whorled leaves that form tight, spiral clusters around its stems. The plant features a rhizome system that allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in dry environments. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are typically found at the tips of the stems. Selaginella mariesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
