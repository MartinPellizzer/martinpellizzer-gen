    "intro": "Seridia sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian seridia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in coastal and arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a cluster, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela. Seridia sicula is often found in southern Italy, particularly in Sicily, where it contributes to the local flora diversity."
