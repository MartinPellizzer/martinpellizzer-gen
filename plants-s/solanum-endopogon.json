    "intro": "Solanum endopogon, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Solanum endopogon is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
