It is a perennial herb with a woody stem and narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, purple to pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open meadows. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to support a variety of ecological interactions within its native habitat."
