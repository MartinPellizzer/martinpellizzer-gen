    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf whitebeam, is a horticultural form of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its rounded, thick leaves that are less serrated than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the autumn. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
