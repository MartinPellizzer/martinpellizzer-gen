    "intro": "Serratula palmatopinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved serrata, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, palmately pinnatifid leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is generally considered a wild plant."
