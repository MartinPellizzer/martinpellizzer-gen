    "intro": "Sclerocactus spinosior var. schlesseri, commonly known as the Schlesser's spiny cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the southwestern United States. It features dense, spiny areoles covered with white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated in succulent collections."
