    "intro": "Sparrmannia subpalmata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sparrmannia, is a member of the Ericaceae family, typically found in temperate regions. It is a shrub characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or acidic environments. Sparrmannia subpalmata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
