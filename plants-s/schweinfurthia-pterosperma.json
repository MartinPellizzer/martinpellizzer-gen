    "intro": "Schweinfurthia pterosperma, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in a single terminal inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Schweinfurthia pterosperma is often found in meadows and on slopes at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters."
