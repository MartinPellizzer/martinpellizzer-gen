    "intro": "Stevia mexicana, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Due to its natural sweetness, it is widely used as a sugar substitute in food and beverages."
