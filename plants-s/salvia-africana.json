    "intro": "Salvia africana, commonly known as African sage, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a grayish-green hue and is often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Salvia africana is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
