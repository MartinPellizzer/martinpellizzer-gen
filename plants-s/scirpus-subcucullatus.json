    "intro": "Scirpus subcucullatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brownish flowers. Scirpus subcucullatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
