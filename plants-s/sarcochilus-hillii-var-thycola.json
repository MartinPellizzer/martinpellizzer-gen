    "intro": "Sarcochilus hillii var. thycola, commonly known as the Thycola Sarcochilus, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark green to blackish leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that have a distinctive, spurred shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs."
