    "intro": "Sporobolus harmandii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in desert ecosystems. Sporobolus harmandii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
