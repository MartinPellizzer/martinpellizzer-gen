    "intro": "Siphocampylus pubiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with hairy stems and leaves, contributing to its common name. Siphocampylus pubiflorus is a perennial herb that is relatively rare and of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
