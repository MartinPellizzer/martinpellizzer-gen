The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Salix \u00d7 germanorum is often planted for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist soils."
