    "intro": "Scirpus globosus, commonly known as bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spherical clusters of small, brown flowers at the top of its stems. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, contributing to wetland ecosystems. Scirpus globosus is also used in phytoremediation to absorb pollutants from water."
