    "intro": "Symplocos hookeri var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose waxberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
