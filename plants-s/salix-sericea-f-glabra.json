    "intro": "Salix sericea f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate wet soils make it a common species in riparian habitats."
