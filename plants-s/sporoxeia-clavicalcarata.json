It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobili. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Sporoxeia clavicalcarata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
