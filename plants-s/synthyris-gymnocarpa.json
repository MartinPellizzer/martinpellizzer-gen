    "intro": "Synthyris gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded synthyris, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that remains closed until maturity, releasing seeds through mechanical means. The species is noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
