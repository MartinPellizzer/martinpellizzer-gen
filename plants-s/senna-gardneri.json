    "intro": "Senna gardneri, commonly known as the Christmas tree senna, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often around the holiday season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The seeds are encased in a hard pod and are adapted for dispersal by animals."
