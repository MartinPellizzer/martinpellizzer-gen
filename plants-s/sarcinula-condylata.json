    "intro": "Sarcinula condylata, commonly known as the red sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in tropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Pennatulaceae and is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure. The coral has a distinctive red or pink coloration, which is due to the presence of symbiotic algae within its tissues. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in reef areas. Sarcinula condylata plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various small marine organisms."
