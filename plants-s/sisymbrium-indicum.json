    "intro": "Sisymbrium indicum, commonly known as the Indian mustard or yellow rocket, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow cruciform flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and fields. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the small, kidney-shaped seeds. Sisymbrium indicum is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
