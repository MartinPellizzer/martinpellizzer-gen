    "intro": "Solidago vulgaris var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, broad leaves that are usually gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in meadows and open woodlands. This variant is distinguished from other goldenrod species by its wider leaves and robust growth habit."
