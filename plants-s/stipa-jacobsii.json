    "intro": "Stipa jacobsii, commonly known as Jacobs' feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and tufted, feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Stipa jacobsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
