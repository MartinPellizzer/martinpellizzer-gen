It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Sobralia abadiorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
