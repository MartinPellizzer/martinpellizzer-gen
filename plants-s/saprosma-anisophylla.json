    "intro": "Saprosma anisophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf saprosma, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that vary in size and shape, often with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
