    "intro": "Sciaphila affinis, commonly known as the shade orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it has slender, grass-like leaves. Sciaphila affinis is characterized by its unique rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
