It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
