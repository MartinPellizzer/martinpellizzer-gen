    "intro": "Salix corylifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in mountainous regions. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
