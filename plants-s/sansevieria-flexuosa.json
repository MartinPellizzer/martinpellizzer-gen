    "intro": "Sansevieria flexuosa, commonly known as the twisted snake plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that exhibit a unique, undulating or twisted appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows upright, with leaves that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, and it thrives in low-light conditions. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, yellow, and white, making it a popular ornamental plant. Sansevieria flexuosa is also noted for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal water."
