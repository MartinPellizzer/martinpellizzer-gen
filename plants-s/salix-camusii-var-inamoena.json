    "intro": "Salix camusii var. inamoena, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. The Kashmir willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
