    "intro": "Saxifraga nervosa var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features small, elongated leaves with prominent veins and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the summer. It is often found in alpine and tundra environments, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
