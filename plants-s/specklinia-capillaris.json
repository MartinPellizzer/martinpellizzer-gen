    "intro": "Specklinia capillaris, commonly known as the slender staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a cascading manner. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it does not require soil for nutrient uptake. Specklinia capillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
