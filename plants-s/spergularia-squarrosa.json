    "intro": "Spergularia squarrosa, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and coastal environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Spergularia squarrosa is adapted to harsh, saline conditions and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands."
