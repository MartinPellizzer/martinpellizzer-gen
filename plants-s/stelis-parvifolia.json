    "intro": "Stelis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant scent. Stelis parvifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
