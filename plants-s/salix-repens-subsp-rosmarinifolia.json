    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the creeping willow with rosemary-like leaves, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a fragrant, minty aroma reminiscent of rosemary. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
