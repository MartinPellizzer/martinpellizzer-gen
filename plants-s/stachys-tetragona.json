    "intro": "Stachys tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled stachys, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features square, hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Stachys tetragona is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators."
