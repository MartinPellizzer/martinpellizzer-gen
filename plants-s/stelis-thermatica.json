    "intro": "Stelis thermatica, commonly known as the hot weather orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Stelis thermatica is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
