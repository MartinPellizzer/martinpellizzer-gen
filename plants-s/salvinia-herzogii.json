    "intro": "Salvinia herzogii, commonly known as the African water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the Salvinia genus. It is native to Africa and is characterized by its floating, feathery fronds that are covered in tiny, spiny structures. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, called sporocarps, are borne on short stalks and contain spores for propagation. Salvinia herzogii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
