    "intro": "Sedum telephium subsp. verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
