    "intro": "Scaphyglottis dunstervillei, commonly known as the Malagasy ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and striking, ghostly appearance. The plant produces showy, pale green or white flowers that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. It grows in rocky or humid forest habitats, typically in the shade of taller vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
