    "intro": "Saxifraga peltata, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Saxifraga peltata is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy and resilient species."
