    "intro": "Sinapis incana, commonly known as hoary mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its pale grayish-green foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, powdery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that mature into a dry, woody structure. Sinapis incana is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions."
