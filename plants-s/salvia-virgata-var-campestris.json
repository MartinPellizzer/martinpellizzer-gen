    "intro": "Salvia virgata var. campestris, commonly known as field sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall spikes of violet-blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
