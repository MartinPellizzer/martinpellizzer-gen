    "intro": "Salsola ericoides, commonly known as the silverleaf gooseweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Salsola ericoides is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, coastal or desert conditions."
