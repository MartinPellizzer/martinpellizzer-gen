    "intro": "Sporobolus sundaicus, commonly known as the Sunda sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Sporobolus sundaicus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
