    "intro": "Scutellaria galericulata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent skullcap, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its hairy (pubescent) leaves give it its scientific variety name, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
