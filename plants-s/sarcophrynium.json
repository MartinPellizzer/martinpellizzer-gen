    "intro": "Sarcophrynium, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plants typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting to their often-dry environments. Sarcophrynium species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
