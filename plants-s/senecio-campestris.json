    "intro": "Senecio campestris, commonly known as the field groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open areas such as roadsides, meadows, and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Senecio campestris is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
