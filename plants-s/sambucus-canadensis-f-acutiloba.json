    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis f. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed elderberry, is a cultivar of the American elderberry. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. The plant is characterized by its palmately compound leaves with sharply pointed lobes. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. The berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed in moderation due to their potential toxicity when unripe."
