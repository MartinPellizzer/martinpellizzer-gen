It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, dark berries that contain toxic compounds. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
