    "intro": "Sideroxylon micranthum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional uses."
