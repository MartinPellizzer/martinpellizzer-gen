    "intro": "Simira erythroxylon var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock simira, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
