    "intro": "Scorzonera plantaginea, commonly known as the meadow scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. Its root system is extensive and tuberous, which contributes to its resilience in various soil conditions. Scorzonera plantaginea is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
