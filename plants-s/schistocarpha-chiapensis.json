    "intro": "Schistocarpha chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas thistle, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, silvery-green leaves with a rough texture and produces purple to violet flower heads that bloom in late summer. Schistocarpha chiapensis is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
