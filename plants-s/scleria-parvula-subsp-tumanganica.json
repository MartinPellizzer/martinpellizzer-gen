It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its small, spike-like inflorescence produces white or pale blue flowers. Scleria parvula subsp. tumanganica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
