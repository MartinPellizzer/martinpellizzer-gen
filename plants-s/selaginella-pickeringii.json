    "intro": "Selaginella pickeringii, commonly known as the Pickering's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that are often a dark green color. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobili on its stems, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Selaginella pickeringii is notable for its ability to survive in poor soil conditions and its role in maintaining ecosystem biodiversity."
