    "intro": "Solanum sinuatorepandum, commonly known as the sinuous leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply sinuous leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for cultivation or consumption."
