    "intro": "Statice preciosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces spikes of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its foliage is gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice preciosa is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value."
