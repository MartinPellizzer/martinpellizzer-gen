    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 rivas-martinezii, commonly known as the Rivas-Martinez saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
