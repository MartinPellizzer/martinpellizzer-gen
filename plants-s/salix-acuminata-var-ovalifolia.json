    "intro": "Salix acuminata var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate to oval-shaped leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are usually a bright green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth margin. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in forested areas."
