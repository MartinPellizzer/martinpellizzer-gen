    "intro": "Santalum multiflorum, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant heartwood, which is highly valued in the perfume and pharmaceutical industries. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. Santalum multiflorum is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and precious resource."
