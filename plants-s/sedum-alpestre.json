    "intro": "Sedum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late summer. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Sedum alpestre is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions."
