    "intro": "Saxifraga diversifolia var. angustibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
