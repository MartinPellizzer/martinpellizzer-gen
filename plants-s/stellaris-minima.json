    "intro": "Stellaris minima, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped blossoms that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellaris minima is considered a rare and endangered species."
