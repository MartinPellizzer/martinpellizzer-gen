    "intro": "Salix thomasiana, commonly known as Thomas's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Salix. It is native to the high Andes of South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Bolivia. This shrub or small tree typically grows in moist, mountainous environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery underside, while its catkins are an important part of its reproductive cycle. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
