    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus f. insularis, commonly known as the Insular santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a subtle, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its low growth habit and drought tolerance. Its foliage remains dense and attractive throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
