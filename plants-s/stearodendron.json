    "intro": "Stearodendron, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. Stearodendron species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, white or yellowish flowers. These plants often grow in moist, shaded environments and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value."
