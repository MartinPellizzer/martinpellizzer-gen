    "intro": "Sterculia mastersii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces woody pods that contain flat, elongated seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
