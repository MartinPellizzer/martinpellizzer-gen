    "intro": "Selaginella ericoides, commonly known as the Ericoid spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures. It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its branching, spiky stems and dense clusters of leaves. Selaginella ericoides is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can sometimes form dense mats. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are prominent and contribute to its ecological role in certain habitats."
