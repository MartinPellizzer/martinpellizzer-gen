    "intro": "Santiridium, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Santiridium is not only admired for its beauty but also holds cultural and spiritual significance in many Asian traditions."
