    "intro": "Schiedea haleakalensis, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Schiedea haleakalensis thrives in the high-elevation, volcanic soils of the Haleakal\u0101 National Park. Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is listed as an endangered species."
