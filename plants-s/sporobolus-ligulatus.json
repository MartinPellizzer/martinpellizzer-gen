    "intro": "Sporobolus ligulatus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that contributes to its ability to colonize new areas. Sporobolus ligulatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
