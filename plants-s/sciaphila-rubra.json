    "intro": "Sciaphila rubra, commonly known as the red ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Sciaphila rubra thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
