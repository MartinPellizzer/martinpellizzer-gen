    "intro": "Spathiphyllum neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina Philodendron, is a tropical plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are elongated and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are surrounded by a spatulate bract, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
