It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps, thriving in poorly drained soils. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall, are arranged in dense, branching clusters.
