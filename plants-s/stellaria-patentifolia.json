    "intro": "Stellaria patentifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadsides. Stellaria patentifolia is often found in temperate climates and is considered a characteristic species of certain grassland habitats."
