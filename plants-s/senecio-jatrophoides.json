    "intro": "Senecio jatrophoides, commonly known as the African Daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Senecio jatrophoides is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
