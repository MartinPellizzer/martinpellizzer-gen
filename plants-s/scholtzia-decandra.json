    "intro": "Scholtzia decandra, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy, silvery-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Scholtzia decandra is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
