    "intro": "Statice ferox, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and maritime environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it ecologically significant. Statice ferox is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
