    "intro": "Scleropoa dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are narrow and tough, with a bluish-gray hue, providing it with a drought-resistant structure. Scleropoa dichotoma is often found in open habitats such as slopes, meadows, and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
