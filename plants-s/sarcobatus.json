    "intro": "Sarcobatus, commonly known as greasewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the amaryllis family. It consists of several species that are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. These plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert regions of North America. They produce small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Sarcobatus species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
