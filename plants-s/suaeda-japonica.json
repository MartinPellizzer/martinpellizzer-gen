    "intro": "Suaeda japonica, commonly known as Japanese saltwort, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is native to coastal regions of East Asia. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences. Suaeda japonica is often found in muddy shores, salt marshes, and tidal flats where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding."
