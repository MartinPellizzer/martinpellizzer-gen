    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia subsp. basaltica, commonly known as the basalt willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine by local communities for their purported healing properties. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
