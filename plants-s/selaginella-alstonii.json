    "intro": "Selaginella alstonii, commonly known as the alston's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems that produce upright, spore-bearing cones. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically bright green and can form dense mats on the forest floor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soil. Selaginella alstonii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
