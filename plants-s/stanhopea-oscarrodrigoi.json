    "intro": "Stanhopea oscarrodrigoi, commonly known as the Oscar Rodriguez Stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers with a complex, intricate structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
