    "intro": "Saussurea tomentosa, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense, woolly white foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
