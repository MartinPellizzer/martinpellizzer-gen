It is a perennial herb with small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has thin, succulent stems and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to arid conditions. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds via wind, aiding in its colonization of open, disturbed habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in maritime regions."
