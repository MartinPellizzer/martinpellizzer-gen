    "intro": "Scorzoneroides montana subsp. breviscapa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The subspecies breviscapa is distinguished by its shorter floral stems compared to other subspecies of Scorzoneroides montana. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is typically found in regions with a short growing season."
