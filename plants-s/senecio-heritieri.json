    "intro": "Senecio heritieri, commonly known as the Heritier's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio heritieri produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
