    "intro": "Stetsonia coryne var. procera, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water, typical of xerophytic species. Its fibrous roots help it survive in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy environments. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in desert botany."
