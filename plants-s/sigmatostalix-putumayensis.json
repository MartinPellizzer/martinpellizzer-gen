    "intro": "Sigmatostalix putumayensis, commonly known as the Andean star-leaf tree, is a South American plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in the cloud forests of the Andes, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
