    "intro": "Stichoneuron membranaceum, commonly known as the delicate water fern, is a primitive aquatic plant belonging to the order Psilophyta. It is characterized by its simple, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the conventional sense, instead having a stem-like axis with spirally arranged sporangia. It thrives in freshwater environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its fossil record provides important insights into the early evolution of vascular plants."
