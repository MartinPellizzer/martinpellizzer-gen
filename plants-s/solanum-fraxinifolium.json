    "intro": "Solanum fraxinifolium, commonly known as the fraxinifolium nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features palmately compound leaves with five to seven lobes, resembling the leaves of the ash tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Solanum fraxinifolium is part of the nightshade family, which includes both edible and toxic plants."
