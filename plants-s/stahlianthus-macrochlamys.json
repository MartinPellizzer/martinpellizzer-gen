    "intro": "Stahlianthus macrochlamys, commonly known as the large-chalmed stahlianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
