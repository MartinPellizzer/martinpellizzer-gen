    "intro": "Sophia sophioides, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including pink, white, and purple, with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Its flowers open in the early morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
