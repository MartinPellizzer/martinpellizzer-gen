It is native to the southeastern United States and features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plants typically grow to a height of 2 to 4 feet and have narrow, grass-like leaves. Sarcanthus thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
