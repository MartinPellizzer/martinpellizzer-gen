    "intro": "Selaginella oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella oaxacana is a sporophyte plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds. It is also notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
