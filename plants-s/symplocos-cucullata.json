    "intro": "Symplocos cucullata, commonly known as the hooded elder or Indian elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its berries are edible but contain seeds that are often dispersed by birds. Symplocos cucullata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
