    "intro": "Streptocarpus vestitus, commonly known as the white streptocarpus, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has dark green, velvety leaves that are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Streptocarpus vestitus is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
