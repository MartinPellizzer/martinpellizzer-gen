    "intro": "Statice otolepis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or saline soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically gray-green in color, and the plant is drought-tolerant. Statice otolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
