    "intro": "Salix wallichiana var. grisea, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, and female flowers are found in separate catkins. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
