It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
