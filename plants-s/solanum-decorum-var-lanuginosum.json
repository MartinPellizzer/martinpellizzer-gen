    "intro": "Solanum decorum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
