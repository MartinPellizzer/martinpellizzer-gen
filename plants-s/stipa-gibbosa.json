    "intro": "Stipa gibbosa, commonly known as the curly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Stipa gibbosa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
