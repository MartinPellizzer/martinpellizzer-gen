    "intro": "Serjania tailloniana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored drupe with a sweet, aromatic flavor. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
