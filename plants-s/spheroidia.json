    "intro": "Spheroidia, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a type of lichen that forms a dense, rounded growth. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its spherical or hemispherical shape. The thallus is typically crustose, with a smooth, waxy surface that can range in color from yellowish to reddish-brown. Spheroidia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces. Its structure is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium."
