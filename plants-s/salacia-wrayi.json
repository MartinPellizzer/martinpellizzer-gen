    "intro": "Salacia wrayi, commonly known as the red-flowered salacia, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salaciacae and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Salacia wrayi is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
