    "intro": "Sarcotheca laxa, commonly known as the loose-sheath orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, greenish-brown seed pods that remain attached to the stem for an extended period. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
