    "intro": "Saussurea handeliana, commonly known as the Himalayan swamp saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, meadow-like environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Its flowers are rich in saffron-like stigmas, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
