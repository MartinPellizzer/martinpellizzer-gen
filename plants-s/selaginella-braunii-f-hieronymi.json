    "intro": "Selaginella braunii f. hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's spikemoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
