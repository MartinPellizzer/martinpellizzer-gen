It features a striking, curved spathe that envelops the spadix, a typical feature of arums. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a glossy surface that aids in water retention. Spatalla incurva is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical greenhouses."
