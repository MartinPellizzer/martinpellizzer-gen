It is a terrestrial herb that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or yellowish, which may contribute to its common name. Sciaphila decipiens is known for its ability to grow in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for shaded gardens."
