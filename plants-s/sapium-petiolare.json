    "intro": "Sapium petiolare, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that contain sticky, toxic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in non-native regions. The tree has a shallow root system and is relatively fast-growing, making it adaptable to various soil types."
