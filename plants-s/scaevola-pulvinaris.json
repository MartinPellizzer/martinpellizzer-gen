    "intro": "Scaevola pulvinaris, commonly known as the silver bush or coastal scaevola, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually blue or purple, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
