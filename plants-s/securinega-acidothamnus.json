    "intro": "Securinega acidothamnus, commonly known as the sour thorn. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, facilitating its spread in suitable environments."
