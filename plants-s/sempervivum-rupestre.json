    "intro": "Sempervivum rupestre, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Sempervivum rupestre is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
