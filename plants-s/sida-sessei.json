    "intro": "Sida sessei, commonly known as the African mallow, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida sessei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical regions."
