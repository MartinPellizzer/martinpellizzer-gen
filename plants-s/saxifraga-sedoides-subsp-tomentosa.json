    "intro": "Saxifraga sedoides subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecies name, *tomentosa*, refers to the dense, woolly covering on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
