    "intro": "Smilax pertenuis, commonly known as the slender greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that are often covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a waxy texture. Smilax pertenuis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
