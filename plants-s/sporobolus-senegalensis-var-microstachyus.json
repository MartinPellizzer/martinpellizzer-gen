    "intro": "Sporobolus senegalensis var. microstachyus, commonly known as the dwarf buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable forage plant in arid environments. Its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes allows it to form dense, persistent stands."
