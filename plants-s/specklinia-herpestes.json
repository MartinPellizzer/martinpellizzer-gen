    "intro": "Specklinia herpestes, commonly known as the coral spike orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with a pseudobulb that supports its growth. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive coral-like appearance. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Specklinia herpestes thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
