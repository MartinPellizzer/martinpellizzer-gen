    "intro": "Spiraea kwangsiensis var. kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Kwangsi spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features slender, arching branches covered with small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its graceful form and seasonal color changes."
