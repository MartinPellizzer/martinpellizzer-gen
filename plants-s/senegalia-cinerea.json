    "intro": "Senegalia cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Senegalia cinerea is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
