    "intro": "Salvia amissa, commonly known as the lost sage, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered in the wild. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
