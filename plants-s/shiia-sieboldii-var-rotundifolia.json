It is characterized by its conical shape, needle-like leaves, and distinctive reddish-brown bark. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The foliage turns a striking golden color in the autumn, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
