    "intro": "Senecio venturae, commonly known as the Ventura groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves with a grayish-green color. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, and it is adapted to survive in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio venturae is considered a rare and endangered species."
