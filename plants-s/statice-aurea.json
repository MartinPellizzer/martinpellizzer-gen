    "intro": "Statice aurea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Statice aurea is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
