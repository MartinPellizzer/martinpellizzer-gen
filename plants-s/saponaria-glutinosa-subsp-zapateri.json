    "intro": "Saponaria glutinosa subsp. zapateri, commonly known as the sticky soapwort, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in ecological and medicinal contexts."
