It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds, which contain the alkaloids strychnine and brucine. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity limits its practical applications."
