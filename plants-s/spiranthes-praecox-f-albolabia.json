    "intro": "Spiranthes praecox f. albolabia, commonly known as the white-lipped early spider-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and northwest Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its distinctive, spiral arrangement of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, before the leaves fully develop, and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
