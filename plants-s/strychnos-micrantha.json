    "intro": "Strychnos micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited strychnos, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy aril. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically used in traditional medicine but is of interest in botanical research."
