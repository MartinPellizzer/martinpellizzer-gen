    "intro": "Stelis lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance, with slender stems and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or on tree trunks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that resembles a spider's leg. Stelis lehmannii is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, relying on air and rain for nutrients."
