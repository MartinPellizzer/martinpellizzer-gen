    "intro": "Saprosma hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy saprosma, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense forests. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
