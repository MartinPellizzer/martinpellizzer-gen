    "intro": "Solanum quadrangulare var. sinuatoangulatum, commonly known as the sinuous-angled nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It features elliptic to ovate leaves with a distinctive sinuous margin, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical berries, often containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by livestock and humans alike."
