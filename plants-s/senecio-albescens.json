    "intro": "Senecio albescens, commonly known as the White Dustweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio albescens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments with minimal water."
