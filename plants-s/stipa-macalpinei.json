    "intro": "Stipa macalpinei, commonly known as MacAlpine's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Stipa macalpinei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
