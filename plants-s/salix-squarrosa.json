    "intro": "Salix squarrosa, commonly known as the white willow or squarrosa willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and grayish-white bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface and a dense covering of white to silver hairs on the underside. It produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, making it a dioecious species. This plant thrives in moist, often boggy habitats and is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season."
