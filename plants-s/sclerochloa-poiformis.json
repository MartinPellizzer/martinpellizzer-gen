    "intro": "Sclerochloa poiformis, commonly known as the African dune grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green or pale brown in color. It is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, making it a common species in coastal dune environments. Sclerochloa poiformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
