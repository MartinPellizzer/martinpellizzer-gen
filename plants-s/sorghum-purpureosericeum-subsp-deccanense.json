    "intro": "Sorghum purpureosericeum subsp. deccanense, commonly known as the Deccan purple millet, is a perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage and silver-tipped bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, semi-arid regions and is adapted to poor soil conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains used for food and fodder. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
