It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature.
