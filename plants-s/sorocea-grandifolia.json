    "intro": "Sorocea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf sorocea, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Sorocea grandifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
