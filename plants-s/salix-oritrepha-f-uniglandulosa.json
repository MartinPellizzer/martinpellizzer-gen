    "intro": "Salix oritrepha f. uniglandulosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide. The leaves are usually covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a silvery-gray appearance. This species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
