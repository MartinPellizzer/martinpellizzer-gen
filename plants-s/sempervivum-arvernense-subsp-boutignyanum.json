    "intro": "Sempervivum arvernense subsp. boutignyanum, commonly known as the Alpilles houseleek, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern France. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of dark green leaves with a bluish tinge, often adorned with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for alpine and xerophytic gardens."
