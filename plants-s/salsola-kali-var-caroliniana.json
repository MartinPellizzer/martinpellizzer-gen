    "intro": "Salsola kali var. caroliniana, commonly known as pigweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline and arid environments. It is an annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It is native to the Americas but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including the southern United States. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and urban settings."
