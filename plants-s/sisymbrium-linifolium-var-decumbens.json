    "intro": "Sisymbrium linifolium var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping babylon grass, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by slender, elongated pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in disturbed soils and arid environments. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
