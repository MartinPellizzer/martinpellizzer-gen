It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Symplocos campestris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, clearings, and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting in temperate regions."
