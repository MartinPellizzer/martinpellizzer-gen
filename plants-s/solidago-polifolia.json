    "intro": "Solidago polifolia, commonly known as the coastal goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes, beaches, and other coastal habitats. Solidago polifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the fall season."
