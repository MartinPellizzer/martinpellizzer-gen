    "intro": "Spiesia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its low stature and rapid growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
