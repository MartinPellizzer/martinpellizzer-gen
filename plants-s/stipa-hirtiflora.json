    "intro": "Stipa hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Stipa hirtiflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful, feathery foliage."
