It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and woodlands. Its flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Sisyrinchium macrocarpum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
