    "intro": "Solanum hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
