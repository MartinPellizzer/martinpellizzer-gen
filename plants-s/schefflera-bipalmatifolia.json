    "intro": "Schefflera bipalmatifolia, commonly known as the two-palmate schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves, which are divided into multiple leaflets radiating from a central point. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters, with a dense, bushy canopy that provides shade. Its foliage is glossy and dark green, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
