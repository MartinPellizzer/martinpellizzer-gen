    "intro": "Silene repens var. costata, commonly known as the wrinkled bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine, wavy ridges. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The variety 'costata' is distinguished by its prominently ribbed or costate leaves, which give it its common name."
