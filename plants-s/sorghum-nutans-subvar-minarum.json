It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced stature compared to other sorghum varieties. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and heat resistance. This subspecies is often used in ornamental horticulture and as a forage crop in marginal lands."
