    "intro": "Schiedeella pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal sandmat, is a unique flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, triangular-shaped stems that form a dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with well-drained conditions. Schiedeella pyramidalis is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
