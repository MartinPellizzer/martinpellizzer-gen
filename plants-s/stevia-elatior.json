It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found in the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and herbal purposes. Stevia elatior is also valued for its low-calorie sweetening properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
