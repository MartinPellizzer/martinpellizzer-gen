The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Spennera hydrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
