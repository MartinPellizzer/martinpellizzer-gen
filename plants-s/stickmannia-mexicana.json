It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted leaves that resemble small, stick-like figures. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually green with a slight waxy coating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures.
