The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a glossy surface and a deep green color. Schefflera stilpnophylla is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in forested areas with high rainfall."
