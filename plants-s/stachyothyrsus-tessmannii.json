It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
