It is characterized by its slender, spike-like flower heads composed of numerous small, tightly packed blooms. The plant typically grows in saline or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its flowers range in color from white to pink and purple, and it blooms throughout the summer months. Statice cuneata is often used in ornamental gardening and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
