    "intro": "Stromanthe idroboi, commonly known as the Rainforest Flame. It is a tropical plant native to Colombia, characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, white, and pink. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in retaining moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant coloration. This plant is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
