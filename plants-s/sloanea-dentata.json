    "intro": "Sloanea dentata, commonly known as the serrated sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Sloanea dentata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional craftsmanship and construction."
