    "intro": "Symphonia tanalensis, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly resistant to decay and insect damage. Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, it is also considered a threatened species in many regions."
