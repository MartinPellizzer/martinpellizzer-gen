    "intro": "Smilacina borealis, commonly known as northern greenbriar, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Smilacaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. Smilacina borealis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
