    "intro": "Schkuhria glomerata, commonly known as the clustered grassvetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Schkuhria glomerata is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various insects and as a contributor to soil fertility."
