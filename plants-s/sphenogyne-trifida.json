    "intro": "Sphenogyne trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, trifid (three-lobed) leaf structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are closely appressed to the substrate and often have a waxy coating to retain moisture. Sphenogyne trifida plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
