    "intro": "Saxofridericia inermis, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. It has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Saxofridericia inermis is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune ecosystems."
