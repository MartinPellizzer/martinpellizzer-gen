    "intro": "Stellaria cherleriae var. petraea, commonly known as the rock starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to withstand harsh conditions. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and resilience to cold temperatures contribute to its ecological significance in its native habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations across high-altitude areas."
