    "intro": "Sagina diversifolia, commonly known as the variable sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arctic and alpine regions. It has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowering stems are usually prostrate or slightly ascending, and the species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Sagina diversifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
