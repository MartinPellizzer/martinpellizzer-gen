    "intro": "Solanum tucumanense, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Peru. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Solanum tucumanense is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
