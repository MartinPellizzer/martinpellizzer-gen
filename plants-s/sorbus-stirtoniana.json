    "intro": "Sorbus stirtoniana, commonly known as the Stewart's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that attract various birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Sorbus stirtoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
