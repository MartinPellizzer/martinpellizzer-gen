    "intro": "Scirpus lereschii, commonly known as the Leresch's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus lereschii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
