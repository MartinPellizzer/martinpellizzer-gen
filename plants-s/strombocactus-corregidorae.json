    "intro": "Strombocactus corregidorae, commonly known as the Corregidor cactus, is a species of cactus native to the island of Corregidor in the Philippines. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. Strombocactus corregidorae is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal environments and is well-suited to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
