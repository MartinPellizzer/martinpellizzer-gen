    "intro": "Senecio laniger, commonly known as the wooly senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio laniger is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and drought tolerance."
