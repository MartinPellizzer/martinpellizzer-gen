    "intro": "Sempervivum spectabile, commonly known as the showy hen-and-chicks, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces striking tall flower stalks with clusters of pink or red flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ability to propagate through offsets makes it easy to cultivate and maintain."
