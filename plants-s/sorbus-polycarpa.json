    "intro": "Sorbus polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that mature in late summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Sorbus polycarpa is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
