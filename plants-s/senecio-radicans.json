It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces small yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or hanging baskets. Its trailing growth habit makes it an excellent choice for adding visual interest to landscapes."
