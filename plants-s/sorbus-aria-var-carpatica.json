    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. carpatica, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, dense crown and smooth, gray bark that develops fissures with age. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which give way to bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
