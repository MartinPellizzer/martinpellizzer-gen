    "intro": "Stachys cretica var. paniculata, commonly known as creeping betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically lavender to purple in color, arranged in dense, paniculate inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed areas."
