    "intro": "Synptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Synptera is native to Africa and is widely distributed in tropical regions around the world. It is often considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
