    "intro": "Schoenus brunneus, commonly known as the brown marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it forms dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with brown, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes are small and inconspicuous, producing wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus brunneus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
