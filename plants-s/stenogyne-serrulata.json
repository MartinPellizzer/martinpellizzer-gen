    "intro": "Stenogyne serrulata, commonly known as the serrated stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals and a distinctive, serrated leaf margin. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Hawaii."
