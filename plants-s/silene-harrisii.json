    "intro": "Silene harrisii, commonly known as Harris's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Silene harrisii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
