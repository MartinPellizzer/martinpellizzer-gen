    "intro": "Salix ehlei, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a species of willow native to high-altitude regions of Asia, including Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has slender, flexible branches and produces catkin-like flowers, which are characteristic of the Salix genus. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, adapted to reflect sunlight in harsh conditions. Salix ehlei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for high-altitude wildlife."
