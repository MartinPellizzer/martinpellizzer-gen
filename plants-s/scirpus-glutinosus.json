    "intro": "Scirpus glutinosus, commonly known as sticky bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a tall, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in the summer. Its stems are often coated with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. Scirpus glutinosus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
