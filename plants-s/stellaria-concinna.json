    "intro": "Stellaria concinna, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Stellaria concinna is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal and is considered a weed in some regions."
