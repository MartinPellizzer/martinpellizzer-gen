    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos maemonensis, commonly known as the Maemon's globe-stephanos, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It blooms in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
