    "intro": "Stipa annua, commonly known as annual needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of grasses. Stipa annua is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its life cycle is annual, meaning it completes its growth, reproduction, and death within a single growing season."
