    "intro": "Selaginella perottetii, commonly known as the Hooker's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features a prostrate or ascending stem with whorled leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. It produces strobila (spore cones) at the tips of its stems, which are responsible for reproduction. Selaginella perottetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
