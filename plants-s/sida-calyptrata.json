    "intro": "Sida calyptrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Sida calyptrata is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
