The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Senna pallida var. trichocraspedon is often found in dry, sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
