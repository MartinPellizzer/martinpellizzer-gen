    "intro": "Salix senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegal willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes. Salix senegalensis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
