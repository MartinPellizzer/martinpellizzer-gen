    "intro": "Salix arctica var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing plant that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters, with flexible branches that often trail along the ground. The leaves are small, elliptical, and covered with a dense layer of short, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. This species is well adapted to harsh climates and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in polar and alpine ecosystems."
