    "intro": "Spiraea palmata, commonly known as the palmate spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble palm fronds, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Spiraea palmata is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and seasonal interest."
