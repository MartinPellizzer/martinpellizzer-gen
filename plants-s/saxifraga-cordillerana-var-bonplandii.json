    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerana var. bonplandii, commonly known as the Bonpland's stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically succulent, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variant is closely related to other saxifrage species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
