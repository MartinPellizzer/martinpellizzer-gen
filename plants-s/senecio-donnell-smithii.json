    "intro": "Senecio donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
