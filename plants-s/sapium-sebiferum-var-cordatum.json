    "intro": "Sapium sebiferum var. cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped Chinese Tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various parts of the world for landscaping purposes. However, it can become invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
