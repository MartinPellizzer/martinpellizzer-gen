    "intro": "Steriphoma ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Steriphoma ellipticum plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing resources for wildlife."
