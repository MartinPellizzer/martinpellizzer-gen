    "intro": "Setaria semirugosa, commonly known as rough dropseed, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in native plant gardens due to its fine texture and seasonal interest."
