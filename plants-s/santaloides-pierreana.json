    "intro": "Santaloides pierreana, commonly known as the Pierre's sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, often growing on the roots of other trees. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellow and are pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which can germinate in the presence of a suitable host. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and habitat diversity."
