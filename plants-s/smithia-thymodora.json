    "intro": "Smithia thymodora, commonly known as the sweetgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, disturbed habitats. Smithia thymodora is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its delicate appearance and strong fragrance make it a notable species in its ecological community."
