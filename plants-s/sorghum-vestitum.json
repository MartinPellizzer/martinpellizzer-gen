    "intro": "Sorghum vestitum, commonly known as the velvet tassels sorghum, is a species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is a tall, annual grass that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with distinctive purple-tinged leaves and fluffy, violet-tan tassels. The plant produces small, two-lobed seeds that are encased in a fibrous covering, which gives it its common name. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in food and animal feed. The plant also has cultural and historical significance in some regions of its native range."
