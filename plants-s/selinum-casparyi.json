    "intro": "Selinum casparyi, commonly known as the Caspian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Selinum casparyi is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a hardy species suited to xerophytic conditions."
