    "intro": "Solidago arborescens, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Solidago arborescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
