    "intro": "Silaus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering silaus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowering period is delayed compared to other silaus species, which is why it is called \"serotinus,\" meaning \"late-bearing.\" The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
