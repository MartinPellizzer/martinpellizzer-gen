    "intro": "Stomatium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf stomatium, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Stomatium latifolium is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
