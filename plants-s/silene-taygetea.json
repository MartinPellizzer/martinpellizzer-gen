It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
