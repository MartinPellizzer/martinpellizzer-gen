    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. oculosum, commonly known as the eye potato, is a variant of the common potato that exhibits distinctive visual characteristics. This plant belongs to the Solanaceae family and is characterized by its tubers that have a unique, eye-like pattern on the surface. The foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, typical of many solanaceous species. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing numerous seeds. This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than culinary use due to its unique appearance."
