    "intro": "Strobilanthes elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked flame flower, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling flames. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Strobilanthes elongata is valued not only for its aesthetic qualities but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators like bees and birds."
