    "intro": "Simlera alpina, commonly known as the alpine simlera, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold and dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season of summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
