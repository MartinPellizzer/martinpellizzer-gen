    "intro": "Schefflera bracteolifera, commonly known as the Hawaiian Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries containing seeds. Its leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. Schefflera bracteolifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
