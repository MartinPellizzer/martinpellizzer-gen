    "intro": "Sabina horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a mat-like structure, often used in rock gardens or as ground cover. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
