It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
