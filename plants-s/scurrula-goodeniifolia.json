It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
