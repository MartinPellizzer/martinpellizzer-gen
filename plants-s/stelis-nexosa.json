    "intro": "Stelis nexosa, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis nexosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
