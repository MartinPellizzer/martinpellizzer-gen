    "intro": "Salix pantosericea, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
