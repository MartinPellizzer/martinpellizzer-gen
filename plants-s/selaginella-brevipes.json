    "intro": "Selaginella brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems that are covered with tiny, scale-like leaves. Selaginella brevipes reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
