    "intro": "Salix nipponica, commonly known as Japanese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The leaves are elongated, with a serrated margin and a bluish-green underside, while the flowers are catkins that appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Japanese gardens."
