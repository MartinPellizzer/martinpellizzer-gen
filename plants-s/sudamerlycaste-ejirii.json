    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste ejirii, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped yellow blooms that appear in clusters during the late spring and summer months. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Sudamerlycaste ejirii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
