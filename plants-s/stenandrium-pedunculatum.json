It is a tropical evergreen shrub characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.
