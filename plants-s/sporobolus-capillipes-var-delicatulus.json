It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
