    "intro": "Suaeda prostrata subsp. anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian saltbush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt marshes. Its succulent leaves and ability to tolerate extreme drought make it an important component of xerophilous ecosystems."
