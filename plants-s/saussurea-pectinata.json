    "intro": "Saussurea pectinata, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Saussurea pectinata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional medicinal uses in Tibetan and Chinese medicine."
