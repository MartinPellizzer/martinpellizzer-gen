It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow hue and a distinctive, pleated lip. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Sarcochilus olivaceus thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
