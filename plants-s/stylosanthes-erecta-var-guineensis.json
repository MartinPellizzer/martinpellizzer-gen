    "intro": "Stylosanthes erecta var. guineensis, commonly known as Guinea stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. It has deep taproots that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is widely used as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen."
