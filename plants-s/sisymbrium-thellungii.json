    "intro": "Sisymbrium thellungii, commonly known as the Swedish rocket, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Sisymbrium thellungii is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
