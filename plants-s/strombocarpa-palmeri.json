    "intro": "Strombocarpa palmeri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common trait among milkweeds. Strombocarpa palmeri thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
