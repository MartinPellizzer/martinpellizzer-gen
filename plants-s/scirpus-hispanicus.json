    "intro": "Scirpus hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form extensive underwater networks, contributing to soil stabilization. Scirpus hispanicus plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species."
