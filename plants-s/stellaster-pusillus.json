    "intro": "Stellaster pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf starburst urchin, is a small echinoderm belonging to the family Stellasteridae. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped body with short, spiky rays that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This species is found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, often inhabiting coral reefs and rocky substrates. Its exoskeleton is composed of calcium carbonate, providing structural support and protection. Due to its small size and unique morphology, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its marine environment."
