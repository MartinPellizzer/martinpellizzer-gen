    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua var. latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered at the ends of its stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
