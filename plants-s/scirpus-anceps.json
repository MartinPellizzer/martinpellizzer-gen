It typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical clusters of small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Scirpus anceps plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and aiding in water filtration."
