    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 cottetii, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Salix amygdaloides and Salix discolor, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, making it popular in ornamental landscaping. It produces catkins and small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands."
