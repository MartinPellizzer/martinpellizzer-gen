    "intro": "Synaedrys ewyckii, commonly known as the Ewyck's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the moist, shaded understory of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, erect stem with a single, elongated leaf. Its pollination mechanism is believed to rely on specific insect species, though little is known about its ecological interactions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Synaedrys ewyckii is considered critically endangered."
