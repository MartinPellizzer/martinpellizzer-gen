    "intro": "Smilax sieboldii var. scobinicaulis, commonly known as the Japanese arrowroot or scobinicaulis smilax, is a perennial vine native to East Asia. It features woody stems with thorn-like projections and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but have a bland taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
