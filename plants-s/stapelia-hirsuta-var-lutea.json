It features thick, fleshy stems that are often branched and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, such as flies and beetles. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
