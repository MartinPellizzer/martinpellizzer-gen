    "intro": "Stemona collinsiae, commonly known as the Collins' stemona, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally recognized in Chinese herbal medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now critically endangered and protected in several conservation programs."
