    "intro": "Sarx alba, commonly known as the white sarx, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale white petals and dense, fibrous root system. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Sarx alba is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
