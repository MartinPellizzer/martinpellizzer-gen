    "intro": "Senecio squalidus var. microglossus, commonly known as the woolly weed or stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, sticky trichomes, which give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. This variety is closely related to other Senecio species and is often mistaken for its more common relative, Senecio squalidus."
