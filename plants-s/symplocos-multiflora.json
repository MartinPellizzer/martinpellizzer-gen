    "intro": "Symplocos multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Symplocos multiflora thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its berries are edible for birds and can be used in traditional medicine."
