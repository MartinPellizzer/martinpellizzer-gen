    "intro": "Salix pedicellata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving it a graceful and ornamental look. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typically in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the autumn. Salix pedicellata is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and along water bodies."
