    "intro": "Solenostemma, commonly known as the \"solenostemon\" or \"star twinner,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asclepiadaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their climbing or trailing habit, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. Solenostemma species produce showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive crown-like structure. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and can also be cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and blooms."
