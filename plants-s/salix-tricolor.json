    "intro": "Salix tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that display a striking coloration of green, white, and pink on the upper surface. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix tricolor thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native environment."
