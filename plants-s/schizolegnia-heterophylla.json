It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, showcasing its adaptability to aquatic environments. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on the growth conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the late spring to early summer. Schizolegnia heterophylla plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for insects."
