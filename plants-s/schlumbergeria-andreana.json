It is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that are often brightly colored and used for propagation. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schlumbergeria andreana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
