    "intro": "Sambucus californica, commonly known as the California elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 feet and features compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain small seeds that can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Sambucus californica is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
