    "intro": "Sisymbrium humifusum, commonly known as the prostrate broomrape, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
