    "intro": "Senegalia angico, commonly known as angico, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, tropical, and subtropical climates, often found in savannas and dry forests. Angico is valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins."
