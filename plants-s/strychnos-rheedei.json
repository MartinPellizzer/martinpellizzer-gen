    "intro": "Strychnos rheedei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces woody, orange-red fruits that contain several seeds. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties. However, due to its slow growth and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species."
