    "intro": "Saxifraga aliciana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga aliciana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
