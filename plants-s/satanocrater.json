It features a thick, branching stem that resembles a spine, with clusters of small, fleshy leaves along its length. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its distinctive shape and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in succulent gardens."
