    "intro": "Spirorhynchus, commonly known as the spiral hornwort, is a type of freshwater algae belonging to the order Spirotyales. It is characterized by its spiral-shaped thallus, which consists of a central axis surrounded by a spiral of filaments. Spirorhynchus typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant reproduces through spores and is often found attached to submerged surfaces. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
