    "intro": "Stuckenia \u00d7 suecica, commonly known as the European water plantain, is a hybrid species within the genus Stuckenia, which belongs to the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often found in shallow water habitats. Stuckenia \u00d7 suecica is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, nutrient-poor water conditions."
