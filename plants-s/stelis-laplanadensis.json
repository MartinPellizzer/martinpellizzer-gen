This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. It produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink, with a distinctive fragrance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful attention to maintain optimal growing conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
