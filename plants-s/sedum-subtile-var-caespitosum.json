    "intro": "Sedum subtile var. caespitosum, commonly known as the mossy stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscaping."
