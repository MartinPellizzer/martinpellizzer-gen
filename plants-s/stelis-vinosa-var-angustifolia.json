    "intro": "Stelis vinosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features linear, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical forest ecosystems."
