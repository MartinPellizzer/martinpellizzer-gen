    "intro": "Soehrensia shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It lacks roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment and nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
