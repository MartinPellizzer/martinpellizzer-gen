    "intro": "Stiftia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their woody stems, small leaves, and clusters of yellow or white flowers. Stiftia species are adapted to harsh environments, often thriving in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
