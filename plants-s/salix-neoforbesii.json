    "intro": "Salix neoforbesii, commonly known as the Neoforbes willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male and female flowering structures, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix neoforbesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
