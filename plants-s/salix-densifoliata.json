    "intro": "Salix densifoliata, commonly known as the dense-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, often weeping branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
