    "intro": "Stapeliopsis breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf star cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy, pale green or grayish coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warm season. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
