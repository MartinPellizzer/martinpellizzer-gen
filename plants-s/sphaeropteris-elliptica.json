    "intro": "Sphaeropteris elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized cycad characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a rosette of large, elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value. Sphaeropteris elliptica is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique appearance and resilience."
