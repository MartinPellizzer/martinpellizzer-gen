    "intro": "Scirpus conicus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and a dense cluster of spike-like flower heads at the top. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus conicus is also an important food source for waterfowl and other wetland wildlife."
