It is characterized by its distinctive, pyramidal fronds that are tightly arranged around the central axis. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Syringodea obpyramidalis thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
