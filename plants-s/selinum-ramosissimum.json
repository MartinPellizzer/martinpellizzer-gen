    "intro": "Selinum ramosissimum, commonly known as desert sand sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Selinum ramosissimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
