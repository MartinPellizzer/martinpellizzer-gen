    "intro": "Stenophyllus coarctatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, nutrient-rich soils, making it a common sight in temperate and tropical regions."
