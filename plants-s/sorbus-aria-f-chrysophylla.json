    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. chrysophylla, commonly known as the goldenleaf whitebeam, is a botanical variant of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the species. This form is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely packed compared to the standard species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
