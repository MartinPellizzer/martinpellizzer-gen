    "intro": "Selliguea stenosquamis, commonly known as the narrow-squamate moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a smooth, green upper surface and a darker, hairy underside. Its spores are produced in small, clustered capsules that are often protected by a peristome. Selliguea stenosquamis plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
