    "intro": "Sonchus bupleuroides, commonly known as the yellow beggarweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and often spread out. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
