    "intro": "Salix psammophila, commonly known as the sand willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has slender, flexible branches and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Salix psammophila plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
