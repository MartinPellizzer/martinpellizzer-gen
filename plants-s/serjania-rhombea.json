    "intro": "Serjania rhombea, commonly known as the Brazilian serjania, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
