    "intro": "Sporobolus minor, commonly known as little barbed wire grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bracts that have tiny barbs, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed environments such as roadsides and gravelly soils. Botanically, it is valued for its drought tolerance and role in ecological restoration projects."
