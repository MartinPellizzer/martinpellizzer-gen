    "intro": "Sabulina oxypetala, commonly known as the sharp-petaled sandplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh climates. Sabulina oxypetala is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental appeal."
