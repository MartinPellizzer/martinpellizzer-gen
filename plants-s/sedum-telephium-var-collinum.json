    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. collinum, commonly known as Blush Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, becoming more reddish in full sun. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments due to its drought tolerance. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
