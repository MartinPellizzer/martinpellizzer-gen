    "intro": "Saldanhaea, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Namibia. The plants are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Saldanhaea species typically thrive in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in their native habitats."
