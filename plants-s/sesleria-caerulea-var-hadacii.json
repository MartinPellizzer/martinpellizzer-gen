It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers. The plant is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The variety is distinguished by its more intense blue coloration compared to the typical form of Sesleria caerulea."
