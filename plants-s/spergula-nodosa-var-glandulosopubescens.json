    "intro": "Spergula nodosa var. glandulosopubescens, commonly known as the glandular pubescent sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant features slender, triangular stems that are often covered in soft, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough surface, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. This variant is notable for its hairy foliage and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
