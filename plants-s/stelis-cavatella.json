    "intro": "Stelis cavatella, commonly known as the hollow stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hollow stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Stelis cavatella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific care requirements."
