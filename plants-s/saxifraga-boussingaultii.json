    "intro": "Saxifraga boussingaultii, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga boussingaultii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh alpine conditions."
