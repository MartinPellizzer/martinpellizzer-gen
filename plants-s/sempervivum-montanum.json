    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum, commonly known as the mountain houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun. Sempervivum montanum is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
