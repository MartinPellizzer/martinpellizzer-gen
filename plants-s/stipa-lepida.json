    "intro": "Stipa lepida, commonly known as slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted inflorescences that resemble delicate plumes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spikelet-based flowers. Stipa lepida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
