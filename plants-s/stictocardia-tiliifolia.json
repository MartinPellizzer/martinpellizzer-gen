    "intro": "Stictocardia tiliifolia, commonly known as the maple leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments. It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus with distinct, leaf-like lobes. The lichen forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on tree bark, especially on maple trees, where it can be easily observed. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator of air quality and ecosystem health."
