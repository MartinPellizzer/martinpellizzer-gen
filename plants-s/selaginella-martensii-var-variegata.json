    "intro": "Selaginella martensii var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that exhibit a striking variegation of green and yellow. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
