    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. litoralis, commonly known as seaside goldenrod, is a variant of the goldenrod species native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
