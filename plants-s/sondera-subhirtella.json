    "intro": "Sondera subhirtella, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Sondera subhirtella is often found in sandy soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats."
