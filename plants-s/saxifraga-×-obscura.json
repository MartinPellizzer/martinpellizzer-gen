    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 obscura, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not commonly used in horticulture."
