    "intro": "Sagina procumbens subsp. littoralis, commonly known as sand-sedge or coastal sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale green flowers in dense clusters, often blooming in early spring. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes contributes to its ecological importance in coastal regions."
