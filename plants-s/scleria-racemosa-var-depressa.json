    "intro": "Scleria racemosa var. depressa, commonly known as the flathead spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils, it is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
