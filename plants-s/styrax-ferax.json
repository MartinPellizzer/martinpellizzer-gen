    "intro": "Styrax ferax, commonly known as the fragrant styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its bark is thick and smooth, often exuding a resinous scent when cut. Styrax ferax is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
