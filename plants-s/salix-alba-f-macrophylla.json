    "intro": "Salix alba f. macrophylla, commonly known as the white willow with large leaves, is a cultivar of the white willow tree. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are larger than those of the typical Salix alba. The plant is native to Europe and is often found near water bodies due to its preference for moist soil. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, and its bark is smooth and grayish-white. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
