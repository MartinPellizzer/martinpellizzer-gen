    "intro": "Salvia alpestris, commonly known as alpine sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Salvia alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a nectar source for pollinators."
