    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. canadensis, commonly known as American elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5\u201311 inches long and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared properly before consumption. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
