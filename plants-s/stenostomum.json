    "intro": "Stenostomum, commonly known as the \"false indigo\" or \"Mexican false indigo,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly Mexico and the southwestern United States. Stenostomum species are characterized by their small, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring or early summer. The leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing species, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
