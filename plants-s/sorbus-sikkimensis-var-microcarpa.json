    "intro": "Sorbus sikkimensis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the Sikkim whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
