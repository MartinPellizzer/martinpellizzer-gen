    "intro": "Stipa aphylla, commonly known as the naked false oat, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and reduced leaf blades, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa aphylla thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
