    "intro": "Scrophularia olympica var. rutifolia, commonly known as the Olympic scrophularia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and forest edges. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are showy, with tubular corollas that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species and is protected in some areas."
