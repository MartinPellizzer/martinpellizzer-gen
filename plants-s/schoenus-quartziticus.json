    "intro": "Schoenus quartziticus, commonly known as the quartz grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of silica, giving the plant its name. Schoenus quartziticus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
