    "intro": "Stelis elegans, commonly known as the elegant orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant appearance. Stelis elegans thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
