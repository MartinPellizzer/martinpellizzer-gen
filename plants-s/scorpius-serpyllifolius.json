It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Scorpius serpyllifolius is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
