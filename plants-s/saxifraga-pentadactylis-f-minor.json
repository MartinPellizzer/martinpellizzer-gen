It features rosettes of dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowering stems bear small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in cymes. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
