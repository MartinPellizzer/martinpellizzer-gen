    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saxifraga stellaris plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the alpine flora diversity."
