    "intro": "Scirpus atrovirens var. georgianus, commonly known as the Georgia sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, triangular stems that rise from rhizomes and are often covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow spikelets at the top of the stem, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a reddish or purplish tint, especially at the base. This variety is adapted to moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
