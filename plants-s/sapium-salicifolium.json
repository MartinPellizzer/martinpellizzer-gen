    "intro": "Sapium salicifolium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a yellowish-green underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain three seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. The tree is also valued for its wood, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine and craftsmanship."
