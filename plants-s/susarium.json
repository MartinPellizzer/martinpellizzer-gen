It is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small, delicate suspender-like structures. The plants typically have hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. Susarium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral display."
