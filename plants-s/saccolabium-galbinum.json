    "intro": "Saccolabium galbinum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in regions with limited water resources."
