    "intro": "Salix scouleriana, commonly known as Scouler's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups of three to five. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Salix scouleriana is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and wet meadows."
