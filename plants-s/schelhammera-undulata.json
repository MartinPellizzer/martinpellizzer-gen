    "intro": "Schelhammera undulata, commonly known as the wavy leaf orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, undulating leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Schelhammera undulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
