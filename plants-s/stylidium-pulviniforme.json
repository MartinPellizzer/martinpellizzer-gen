    "intro": "Stylidium pulviniforme, commonly known as the cushion devil's-bit, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils, often found in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Stylidium pulviniforme is also notable for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and birds due to its bright, showy inflorescences."
