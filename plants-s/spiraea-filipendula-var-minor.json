    "intro": "Spiraea filipendula var. minor, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring arching stems covered in small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
