It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Statice virgata is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
