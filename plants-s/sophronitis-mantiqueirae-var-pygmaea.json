    "intro": "Sophronitis mantiqueirae var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid of Mantiqueira, is a rare and miniature orchid species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and illegal collection."
