    "intro": "Strobilanthes pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf flame flower, is a small herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall compact appearance. Strobilanthes pusilla is notable for its short flowering period and is often found in lowland tropical regions."
