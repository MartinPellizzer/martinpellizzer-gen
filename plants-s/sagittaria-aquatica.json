    "intro": "Sagittaria aquatica, commonly known as water arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, narrow stems that often extend into the water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that emerge from the water, typically in clusters. It thrives in muddy or sandy substrates and is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Sagittaria aquatica plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
