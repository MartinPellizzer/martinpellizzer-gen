    "intro": "Scorias, commonly known as volcanic rock or scoria, is a type of porous, lightweight volcanic rock formed from cooled lava. It is characterized by its dark color, rough texture, and numerous air pockets that give it a lightweight structure. Scoria is often found in volcanic regions and can be used as a building material or in horticulture for drainage. Its unique appearance and properties make it both functional and aesthetically appealing. However, it is not a plant but a mineral-based material, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense."
