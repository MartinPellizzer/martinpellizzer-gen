    "intro": "Setaria rottleri, commonly known as Rottler's foxtail, is a grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
