    "intro": "Senecio epiphyticus, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like structure that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, making it an epiphytic species. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and rocky habitats."
