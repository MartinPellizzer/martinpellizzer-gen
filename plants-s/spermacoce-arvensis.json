    "intro": "Spermacoce arvensis, commonly known as field spiderling, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, blue-black fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two parts upon maturity. It is native to temperate regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Spermacoce arvensis is known for its ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind and animals."
