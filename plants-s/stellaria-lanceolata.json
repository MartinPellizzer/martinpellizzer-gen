    "intro": "Stellaria lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Stellaria lanceolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate partial shade."
