    "intro": "Spiroconus glaucus, commonly known as the blue spiroconus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
