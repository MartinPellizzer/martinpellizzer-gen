    "intro": "Solidago squarrosa var. ramosa, commonly known as the silver bluestem or slender goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in soft, silver-gray hairs, giving it its common name. Its showy yellow flower clusters appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its more branched and compact growth habit compared to other goldenrod species."
