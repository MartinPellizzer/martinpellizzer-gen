It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a smooth, spherical berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Solanum petilum contains alkaloids and is considered toxic to both humans and animals."
