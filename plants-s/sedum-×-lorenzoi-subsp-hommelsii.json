It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This species is known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions."
