    "intro": "Salvia cyclophylla, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are softly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Salvia cyclophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
