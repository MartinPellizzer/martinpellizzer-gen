    "intro": "Saxifraga paniculata subvar. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 30 cm in height, covered with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in panicles. Its leaves are typically basal and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subvariety is distinguished by its elongated stems and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
