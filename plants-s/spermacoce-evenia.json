    "intro": "Spermacoce evenia, commonly known as the small bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Spermacoce evenia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties."
