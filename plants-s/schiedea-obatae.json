    "intro": "Schiedea obatae, commonly known as the Obata's scaly tree. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. This plant is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Schiedea obatae grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
