    "intro": "Samyda macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited samyda, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by large, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Samyda macrocarpa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and as a source of timber."
