    "intro": "Statice arenaria, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, salt-tolerant growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important pioneer species in sandy environments. Statice arenaria is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, fluffy blooms."
