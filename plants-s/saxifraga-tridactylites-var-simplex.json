    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites var. simplex, commonly known as the simple saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cold and conditions are harsh. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pink flowers with five petals. It is well adapted to extreme climates, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and freezing temperatures. This variety is distinguished by its simpler leaf structure compared to other varieties of Saxifraga tridactylites."
