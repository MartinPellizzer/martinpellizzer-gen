    "intro": "Styrax carranzae, commonly known as the Carranza's styrax, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been used traditionally for its aromatic properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
