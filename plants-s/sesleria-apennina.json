    "intro": "Sesleria apennina, commonly known as the Apennine sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Sesleria apennina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
