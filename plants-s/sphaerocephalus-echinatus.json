    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rounded thallus with a dense, spiny surface. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients. Its spiny appearance is due to the presence of raised, waxy projections on the upper surface. The lichen is often found in shaded, moist environments and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
