    "intro": "Scirpus prolongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Scirpus prolongatus is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the shores of lakes and rivers."
