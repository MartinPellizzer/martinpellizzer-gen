It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores. Selaginella sobolifera is an important species in ecological studies due to its ancient lineage and role in forest ecosystems."
