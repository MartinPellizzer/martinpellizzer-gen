    "intro": "Specklinia eugenii, commonly known as the Emerald Bower, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Specklinia eugenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
