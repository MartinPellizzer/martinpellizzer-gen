    "intro": "Stapelia elongata, commonly known as the elongated stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features long, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to any collection. The plant produces small, waxy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many stapelia species. Stapelia elongata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and requiring minimal watering."
