    "intro": "Sonchus hispidulus, commonly known as hispidulus sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and potential to become invasive, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
