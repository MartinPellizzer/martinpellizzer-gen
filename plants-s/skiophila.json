    "intro": "Skiophila, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth texture, and the stems are often hairy. Skiophila species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. They are valued for their ornamental beauty and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
