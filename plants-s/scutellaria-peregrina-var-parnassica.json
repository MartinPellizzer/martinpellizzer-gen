    "intro": "Scutellaria peregrina var. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian skullcap, is a rare and distinctive plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
