It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from sporophylls that form in clusters at the tips of the stems. Selaginella whytei is adapted to survive in dry conditions, exhibiting features such as reduced leaf surfaces and deep root systems."
