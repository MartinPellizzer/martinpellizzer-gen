    "intro": "Serapias regularis, commonly known as the regular orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soils. Serapias regularis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
