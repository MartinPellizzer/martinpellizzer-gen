    "intro": "Sebifera, commonly known as the common sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and tall, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils across temperate regions. Sebifera produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance."
