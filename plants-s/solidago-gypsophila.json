    "intro": "Solidago gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in arid and rocky habitats. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to grow in gypsum soils, which are rich in calcium sulfate and often challenging for other plant species. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Solidago gypsophila is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar sources in its native range."
