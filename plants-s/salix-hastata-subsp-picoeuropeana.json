    "intro": "Salix hastata subsp. picoeuropeana, commonly known as the European weeping willow, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it requires careful management due to its aggressive growth habits."
