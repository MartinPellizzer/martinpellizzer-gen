It belongs to the family Holothuriidae and is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body covered in tiny, tube-like structures called podia. The plant's anatomy includes a distinctive proboscis used for feeding, as well as a complex water vascular system. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and plays a role in maintaining benthic ecosystem health. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes harvested for commercial purposes."
