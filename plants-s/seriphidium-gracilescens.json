    "intro": "Seriphidium gracilescens, commonly known as the slender dwarf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Seriphidium gracilescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
