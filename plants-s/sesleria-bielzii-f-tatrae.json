    "intro": "Sesleria bielzii f. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra mountain sesleria, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
