    "intro": "Solanum armatum, commonly known as the armed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to berries, which are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
