    "intro": "Salpixantha, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Salpixantha is considered a botanical curiosity and is rarely studied."
