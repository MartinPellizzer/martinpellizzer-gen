    "intro": "Solidago victorinii, commonly known as the Victorin's goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of yellow flowers. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and elongated, yellow inflorescences make it visually distinct from other goldenrods. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
