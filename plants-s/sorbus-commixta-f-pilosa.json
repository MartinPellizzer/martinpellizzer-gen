It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"pilosa.\" The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies due to their astringent properties. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in its native habitats."
