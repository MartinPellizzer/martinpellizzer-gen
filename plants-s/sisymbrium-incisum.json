    "intro": "Sisymbrium incisum, commonly known as narrowleaf wild radish, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems with alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are typically narrow and serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a short, cylindrical pod that splits open to release small, round seeds. Sisymbrium incisum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
