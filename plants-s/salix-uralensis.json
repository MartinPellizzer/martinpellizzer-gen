    "intro": "Salix uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
