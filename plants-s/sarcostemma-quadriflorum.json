    "intro": "Sarcostemma quadriflorum, commonly known as the four-flowered milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, a common trait among members of the Apocynaceae family. Sarcostemma quadriflorum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
