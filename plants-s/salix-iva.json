    "intro": "Salix iva, commonly known as the common willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, oval leaves that are typically serrated along the edges. Salix iva thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
