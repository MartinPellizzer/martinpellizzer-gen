It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, spiny leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Scorodonia spinosa is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
