It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has hairy, square stems with opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its genus, Scutellaria, is characterized by a distinctive cap-like structure called a calyx, which surrounds the flower. Scutellaria pachyrrhiza is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and sedative properties."
