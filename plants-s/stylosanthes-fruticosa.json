    "intro": "Stylosanthes fruticosa, commonly known as shrub stylosanthes, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with multiple stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, lens-shaped pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage species for livestock. Stylosanthes fruticosa also has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, contributing to soil fertility in agricultural systems."
