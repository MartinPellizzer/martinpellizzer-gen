    "intro": "Schiedea ligustrina, commonly known as the Hawaiian skyflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments on forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Schiedea ligustrina is also notable for its role in Hawaiian ecological systems and is considered a rare, endemic species."
