    "intro": "Saxifraga macrostigma, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features rosettes of broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late summer. Saxifraga macrostigma is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
