It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves with a hairy surface. Its flowers are usually white or purple and are followed by small, round berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike."
