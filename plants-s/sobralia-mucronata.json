    "intro": "Sobralia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-tipped sobralia, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters along the stem. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its natural habitat on trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing a sturdy surface for photosynthesis. Sobralia mucronata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
