It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its fruits are slender pods that split open to release small, rounded seeds. Sisymbrium arabiforme is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
