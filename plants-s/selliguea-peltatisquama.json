    "intro": "Selliguea peltatisquama, commonly known as the broad-scale moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of rhizoids. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and are surrounded by a peristome, which aids in spore dispersal. Selliguea peltatisquama plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
