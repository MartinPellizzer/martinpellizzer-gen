    "intro": "Sagina procumbens var. glaberrima, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, succulent, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an important pioneer species in sandy ecosystems."
