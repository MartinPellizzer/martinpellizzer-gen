    "intro": "Stipa tucumana, commonly known as the Tucuman needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of narrow, bristle-like lemma. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct sheath that clasps the stem. Stipa tucumana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its architectural form and resilience."
