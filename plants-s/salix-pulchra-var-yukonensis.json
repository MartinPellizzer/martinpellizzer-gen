    "intro": "Salix pulchra var. yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon river willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
