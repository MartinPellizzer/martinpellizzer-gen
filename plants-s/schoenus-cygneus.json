    "intro": "Schoenus cygneus, commonly known as the swan grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Schoenus cygneus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
