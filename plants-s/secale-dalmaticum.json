    "intro": "Secale dalmaticum, commonly known as Dalmatian rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
