    "intro": "Stachys matthewsii, commonly known as Matthews' hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
