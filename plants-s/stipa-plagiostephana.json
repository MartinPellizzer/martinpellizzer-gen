It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its long, narrow leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Stipa plagiostephana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid habitats."
