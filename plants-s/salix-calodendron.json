    "intro": "Salix calodendron, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and its distinctive, willow-like leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which appear in clusters along the branches. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Salix calodendron is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
