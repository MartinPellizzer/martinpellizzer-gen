    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated bindweed, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves with distinctive variegation of green, white, and sometimes pink or red. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a slight purple hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks or in woodland areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
