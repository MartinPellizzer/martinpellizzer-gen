    "intro": "Steenhammera maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flowers and silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in salty environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its unique structure allows it to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Steenhammera maritima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
