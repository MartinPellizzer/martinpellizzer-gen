    "intro": "Swartzia acutifolia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its hard, heavy wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pods containing seeds. Swartzia acutifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making."
