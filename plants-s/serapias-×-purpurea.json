It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its tall, wiry stems and clusters of showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three sepals and three petals, and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
