    "intro": "Scirpus leucanthus, commonly known as white-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often standing in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers at the top of the stem, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Scirpus leucanthus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
