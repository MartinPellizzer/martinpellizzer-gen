    "intro": "Sapindus saponaria var. jardiniana, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long and composed of 9 to 15 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing a single, hard-seeded pulp. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have a mild, soapy scent, giving rise to its common name. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
