    "intro": "Symphyotrichum ericoides subsp. pansum, commonly known as the Appalachian heath aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, acidic soils of woodlands and rocky slopes, thriving in partial to full sun. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a waxy coating. It produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in late summer to early autumn, with purple to pink ray florets and yellow disk florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and the presence of glandular hairs on its foliage."
