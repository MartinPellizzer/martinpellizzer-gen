    "intro": "Spiraea cardotiana, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Spiraea cardotiana is relatively hardy and prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
