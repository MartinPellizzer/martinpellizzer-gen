It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to withstand drought. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and desert environments. Its morphology includes a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and pink or white flowers. Spergularia akkensis is notable for its ecological resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
