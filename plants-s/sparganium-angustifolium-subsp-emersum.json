    "intro": "Sparganium angustifolium subsp. emersum, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear whorled clusters of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically submerged or floating in water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to wetland vegetation structure. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
