    "intro": "Syzygium crebrinerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined apple or the narrow-veined rambutan, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, spiny fruit with a soft, pulpy interior. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a prominent venation pattern, which is a key identifying feature. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is often harvested when fully mature for its edible pulp and seeds."
