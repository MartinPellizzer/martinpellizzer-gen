    "intro": "Stevia erecta, commonly known as sweet leaf or sugar leaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. Stevia erecta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for both ornamental and medicinal use. Its cultivation has gained popularity as a natural alternative to sugar due to its low calorie content and health benefits."
