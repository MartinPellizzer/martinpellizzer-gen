    "intro": "Schoepfia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible schoepfia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching, often sprawling growth habit and its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to arid environments. Schoepfia flexuosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
