    "intro": "Schoenus maritimus, commonly known as the sea sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, salt marshes, and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered in panicles. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize coastal soils, making it an important pioneer species in saltwater ecosystems. Schoenus maritimus plays a crucial role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
