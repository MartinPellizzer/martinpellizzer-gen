    "intro": "Solanum wacketii, commonly known as the Wackett's nightshade, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color as they ripen. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it should be handled with care as it contains toxic compounds."
