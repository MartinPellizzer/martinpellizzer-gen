    "intro": "Schoenus burmanni, commonly known as the Burmann's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. Schoenus burmanni is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
