    "intro": "Semele androgyna, commonly known as the Androgynous Flame Lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored flowers that display both male and female reproductive structures, a trait known as androgyne. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid environment. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, when it produces clusters of striking orange and purple petals. The botanical significance of Semele androgyna lies in its unique floral morphology, which has intrigued botanists and conservationists alike."
