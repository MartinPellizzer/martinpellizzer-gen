    "intro": "Syncarpia subargentea, commonly known as the silver-dollar tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from silver-green to grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by clusters of orange-red berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating that gives them their distinctive appearance. Syncarpia subargentea is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
