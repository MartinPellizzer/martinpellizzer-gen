    "intro": "Salix micromegas, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of only a few centimeters. The plant features slender, willow-like branches with small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it produces small, woody fruits. Salix micromegas is adapted to harsh, cold environments and plays a role in stabilizing permafrost soils."
