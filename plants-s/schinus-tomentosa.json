It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
