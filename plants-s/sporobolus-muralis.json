    "intro": "Sporobolus muralis, commonly known as the wall grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Sporobolus muralis is often found growing on rocky slopes, canyon walls, and other exposed sites where it plays a role in preventing erosion."
