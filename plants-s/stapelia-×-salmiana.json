    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 salmiana, commonly known as the starfish plant, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped, fleshy leaves that resemble the texture of a starfish. The plant produces striking, lantern-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Stapelia \u00d7 salmiana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and distinctive appearance."
