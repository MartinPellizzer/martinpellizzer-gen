    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma lusus glabra, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, and its stems are usually prostrate or ascending. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Stellaria dichotoma lusus glabra is a hardy perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
