    "intro": "Solanum tuquerrense, commonly known as the Tuquerrense nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in parts of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its fruits are small berries that mature to a yellowish or orange color, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
