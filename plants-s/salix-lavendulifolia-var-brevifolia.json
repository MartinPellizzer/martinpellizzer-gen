    "intro": "Salix lavendulifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved willow, is a shrub-like species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to other willow varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, often shady environments such as stream banks and forest edges. Its small, catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
