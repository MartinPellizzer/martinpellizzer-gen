It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky fruit that resembles a star. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, woody stems and alternate, simple leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit, which is edible when ripe, contains a single seed and is used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
