    "intro": "Sarcanthus williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's sarcanthus, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in moist, shaded environments like swamps and pine flatwoods. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sarcanthus williamsonii is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
