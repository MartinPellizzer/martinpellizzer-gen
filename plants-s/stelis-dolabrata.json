    "intro": "Stelis dolabrata, commonly known as the sickle orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, branching stem with numerous small, green leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive sickle-shaped lip that gives the species its common name. Stelis dolabrata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth."
