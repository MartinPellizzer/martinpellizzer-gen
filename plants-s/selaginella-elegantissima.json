It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, feathery foliage and a branching structure that resembles a fern. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. Selaginella elegantissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
