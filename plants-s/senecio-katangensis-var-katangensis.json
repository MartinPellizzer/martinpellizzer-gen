    "intro": "Senecio katangensis var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
