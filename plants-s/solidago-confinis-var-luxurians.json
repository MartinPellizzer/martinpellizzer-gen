The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters and has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear numerous small, rayless flower heads. This variety is often found in moist to dry woodlands and open fields, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
