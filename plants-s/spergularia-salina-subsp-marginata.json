    "intro": "Spergularia salina subsp. marginata, commonly known as salt marsh pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its pink to red flowers and succulent, salt-tolerant leaves. This subspecies thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its stems are typically prostrate or decumbent, allowing it to spread across the wetland surface. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
