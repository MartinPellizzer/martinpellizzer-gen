    "intro": "Schizoloma stortii, commonly known as the Stort's false orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble those of true orchids. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and showy, often fragrant blooms that appear in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schizoloma stortii is considered a species of conservation concern."
