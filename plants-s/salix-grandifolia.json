    "intro": "Salix grandifolia, commonly known as the largeleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as stream banks and wetlands. Salix grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
