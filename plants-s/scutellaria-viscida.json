    "intro": "Scutellaria viscida, commonly known as sticky skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin. Its small, tubular flowers are usually blue to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. The sticky resin on its leaves is a distinctive botanical characteristic that aids in deterring herbivores."
