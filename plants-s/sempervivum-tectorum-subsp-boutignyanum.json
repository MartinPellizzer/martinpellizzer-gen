    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum subsp. boutignyanum, commonly known as the French roof plant, is a succulent species native to southern France and parts of northern Africa. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces upright stems with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
