    "intro": "Sonchus hieracioides, commonly known as field sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and basal rosette of lobed, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it both a weed and a potential forage plant."
