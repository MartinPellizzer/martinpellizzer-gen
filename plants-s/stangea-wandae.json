    "intro": "Stangea wandae, commonly known as the Wandae's stangea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it one of the tallest ferns in its habitat. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, using its rhizomes to anchor itself to trees and other vegetation. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns. Stangea wandae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth."
