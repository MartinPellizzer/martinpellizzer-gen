    "intro": "Saxifraga sobolifera, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and arranged in a dense cluster at the end of the stems. Saxifraga sobolifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
