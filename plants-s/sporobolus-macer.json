    "intro": "Sporobolus macer, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Sporobolus macer is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to disturbed sites."
