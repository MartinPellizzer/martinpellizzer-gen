    "intro": "Stipa letourneuxii subsp. letourneuxii, commonly known as the Letourneux's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. This subspecies is often found in open grasslands, rocky slopes, and along streambanks."
