It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Scutellaria mollifolia is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is reflected in its aromatic properties and square stems."
