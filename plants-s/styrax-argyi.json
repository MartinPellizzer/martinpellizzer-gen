    "intro": "Styrax argyi, commonly known as Chinese frankincense or sweet gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its resin, known as styrax, has been used traditionally in Chinese medicine and incense. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitats."
