    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through a fleshy, explosive mechanism. Stigmaphyllon angustilobum is typically found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in the understory of tropical rainforests."
