    "intro": "Streptotrachelus pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle in the family Chrysomelidae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it inhabits humid forests and is often found on the leaves of various host plants. The beetle's body is typically dark-colored with metallic or iridescent markings, and its larvae feed on the leaves of its host plants. This species plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to the decomposition of plant material. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized insect."
