    "intro": "Schizoglossum gerrardii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among members of its family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Schizoglossum gerrardii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
