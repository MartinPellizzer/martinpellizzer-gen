    "intro": "Schefflera agamae, commonly known as the African arrowroot or African shield fern, is a tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy appearance with large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are a source of food for birds and small mammals. Schefflera agamae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. It is also valued for its ability to purify air and its resilience to indoor conditions."
