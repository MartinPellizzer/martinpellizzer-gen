    "intro": "Sonerila tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged sonerila, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. Sonerila tetraptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
