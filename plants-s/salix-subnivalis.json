    "intro": "Salix subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments where temperatures are low and conditions are harsh. It produces catkins as its reproductive structures, which are adapted for wind pollination. Salix subnivalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
