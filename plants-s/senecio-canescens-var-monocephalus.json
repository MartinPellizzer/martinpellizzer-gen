    "intro": "Senecio canescens var. monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed yellowstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant features hairy, gray-green leaves and produces bright yellow ray florets that bloom in late summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
