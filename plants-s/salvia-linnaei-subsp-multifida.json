    "intro": "Salvia linnaei subsp. multifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
