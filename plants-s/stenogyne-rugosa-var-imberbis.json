    "intro": "Stenogyne rugosa var. imberbis, commonly known as the rough stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and streamside areas. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and are adapted for pollination by native Hawaiian honeycreepers. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
