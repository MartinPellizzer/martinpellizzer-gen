    "intro": "Selaginella prasina, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit. It features needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a trait known as heterospory, which is a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella prasina is also notable for its ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species in various habitats."
