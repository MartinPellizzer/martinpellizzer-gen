    "intro": "Sobralia hirtzii, commonly known as the Hirtz's sobralia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored, spurred flowers. The plant typically features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sobralia hirtzii is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
