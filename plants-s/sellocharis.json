    "intro": "Sellocharis, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Sellocharis species are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic conditions. Due to their specific habitat requirements, Sellocharis plants are often indicators of healthy wetland ecosystems."
