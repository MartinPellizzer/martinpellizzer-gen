    "intro": "Stratiotes nymphoides, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems, giving it a distinctive clover-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Stratiotes nymphoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
