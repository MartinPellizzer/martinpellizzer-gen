It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Stera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas."
