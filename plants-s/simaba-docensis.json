    "intro": "Simaba docensis, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its strength and workability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, Simaba docensis is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations."
