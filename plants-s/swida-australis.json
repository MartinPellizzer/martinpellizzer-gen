    "intro": "Swida australis, commonly known as the southern swida, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Swida australis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions. It is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
