    "intro": "Solanum supinum var. rehobothense, commonly known as the Rehoboth nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant typically grows in a prostrate or sprawling manner, with hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark purple color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to other members of the genus. Due to its toxicity, it is not suitable for human consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
