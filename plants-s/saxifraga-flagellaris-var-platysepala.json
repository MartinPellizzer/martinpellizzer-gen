    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris var. platysepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in crevices and on slopes. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with broad, rounded sepals. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. This variant is distinguished by its broader sepals compared to the typical form of Saxifraga flagellaris."
