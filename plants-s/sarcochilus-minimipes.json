    "intro": "Sarcochilus minimipes, commonly known as the miniature helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The plant produces a single, erect spike bearing several small, intricate flowers, each with a prominent, hood-like labellum. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Sarcochilus minimipes is a rare and delicate species, often found in rainforest understoreys."
