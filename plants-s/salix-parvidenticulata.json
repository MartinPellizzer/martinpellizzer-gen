    "intro": "Salix parvidenticulata, commonly known as the small-toothed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
