    "intro": "Saussurea alpina var. cynoglossifolia, commonly known as the Alpine saffron flower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are narrow and tongue-shaped, giving it its specific epithet *cynoglossifolia*, meaning \"tongue-shaped leaf.\" The plant produces striking yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows at high altitudes. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
