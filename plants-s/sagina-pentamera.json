    "intro": "Sagina pentamera, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes, streambanks, and disturbed areas. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It produces small, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind. Sagina pentamera is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
