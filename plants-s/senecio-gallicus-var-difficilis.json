    "intro": "Senecio gallicus var. difficilis, commonly known as the Gallic harebell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
