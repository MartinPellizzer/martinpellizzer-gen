    "intro": "Saxifraga polytrichoides, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, with five white or pale pink petals and prominent yellow stamens. Saxifraga polytrichoides is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats."
