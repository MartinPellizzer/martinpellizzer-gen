    "intro": "Sorbus commixta var. rufoferruginea, commonly known as the red-ironwood rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by clusters of red-orange berries. Its bark is thick and rugged, often covered in a reddish-brown, flaky texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking autumn foliage."
