It typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, where it thrives in partial shade. The plant features a short, erect stem with several fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a raceme, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Stelis hiatilabia is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
