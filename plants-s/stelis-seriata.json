    "intro": "Stelis seriata, commonly known as the serial stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering structure. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink, and are often fragrant. Stelis seriata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained potting media."
