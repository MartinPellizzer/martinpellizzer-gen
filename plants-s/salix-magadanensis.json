    "intro": "Salix magadanensis, commonly known as the Magadan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Far East of Russia and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, moist environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It is well adapted to permafrost conditions and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in Arctic and subarctic regions."
