    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. plumosa, commonly known as the Downy False Solomon's Seal, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity."
