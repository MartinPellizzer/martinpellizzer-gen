    "intro": "Solidago scrophularifolia, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and have a slightly hairy texture. Solidago scrophularifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during its flowering season."
