    "intro": "Stenotaphrum swartzianum, commonly known as common St. Augustine grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and creeping growth habit, forming a thick sod. The plant has narrow, flat blades with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and landscaping. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively and recover quickly from damage."
