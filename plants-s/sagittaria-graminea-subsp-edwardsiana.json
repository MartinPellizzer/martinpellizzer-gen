    "intro": "Sagittaria graminea subsp. edwardsiana, commonly known as the Edwards' arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom above the water surface. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
