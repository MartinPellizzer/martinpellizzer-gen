    "intro": "Salix mandshurica, commonly known as Manchurian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, forested areas and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces catkin-like flowers in the spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Salix mandshurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
