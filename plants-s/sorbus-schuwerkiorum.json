    "intro": "Sorbus schuwerkiorum, commonly known as the Schuwerk's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
