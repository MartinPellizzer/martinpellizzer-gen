    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium f. calvescens, commonly known as gray bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and tall, slender flowering stalks that produce feathery panicles. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for prairie and meadow landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable. The varietal form f. calvescens is distinguished by its more compact growth and reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form."
