    "intro": "Schefflera odorata, commonly known as the fragrant schefflera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of palmate leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Schefflera odorata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
