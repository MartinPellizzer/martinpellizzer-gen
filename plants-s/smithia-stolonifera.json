    "intro": "Smithia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes to form new plants. This hardy species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
