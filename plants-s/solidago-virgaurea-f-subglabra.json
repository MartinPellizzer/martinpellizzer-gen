    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a prominent central vein. This variant differs from the typical form by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
