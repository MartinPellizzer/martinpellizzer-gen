    "intro": "Solanum callicarpifolium var. radula, commonly known as the radula variant of the sweet potato vine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, variegated foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries, which are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for container gardening and ground cover. Its botanical features make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically valuable in native habitats."
