    "intro": "Scaevola tournoa, commonly known as the coastal fairy fan, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has narrow, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Scaevola tournoa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
