    "intro": "Statice hoeltzeri, commonly known as the Hoeltzer's sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy or coastal soils, making it useful for erosion control. Statice hoeltzeri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
