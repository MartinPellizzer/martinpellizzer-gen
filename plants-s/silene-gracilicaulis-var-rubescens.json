    "intro": "Silene gracilicaulis var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed ladies' tresses, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that turn reddish in color, especially when mature. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its more intense red stem coloration compared to the typical form of Silene gracilicaulis."
