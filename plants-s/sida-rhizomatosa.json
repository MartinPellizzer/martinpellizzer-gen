It is characterized by its prostrate or climbing growth habit and features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fibrous roots are extensive and contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively.
