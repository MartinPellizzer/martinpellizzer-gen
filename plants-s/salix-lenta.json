    "intro": "Salix lenta, commonly known as the slow-growing willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. Salix lenta is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
