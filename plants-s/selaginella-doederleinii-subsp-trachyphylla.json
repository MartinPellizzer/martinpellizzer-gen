It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of foliage. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and have a rough, textured surface, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This species is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures."
