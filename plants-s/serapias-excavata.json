    "intro": "Serapias excavata, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, deeply divided corolla. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas. Serapias excavata is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant suited to Mediterranean climates."
