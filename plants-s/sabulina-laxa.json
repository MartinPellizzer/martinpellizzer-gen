    "intro": "Sabulina laxa, commonly known as the loose sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. It is adapted to cold climates and has a shallow root system that helps it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Sabulina laxa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
