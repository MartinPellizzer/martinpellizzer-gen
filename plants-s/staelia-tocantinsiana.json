It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
