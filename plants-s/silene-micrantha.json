    "intro": "Silene micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Silene micrantha thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is often found in the eastern and central United States, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
