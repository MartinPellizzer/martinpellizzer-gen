    "intro": "Sporobolus farinosus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sand dropseed is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
