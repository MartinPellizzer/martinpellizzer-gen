    "intro": "Sclerolaena cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, black berries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Sclerolaena cuneata is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant suited to Mediterranean climates."
