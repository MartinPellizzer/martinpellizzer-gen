It features small, dark green, aromatic leaves and produces striking violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or containers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, low-maintenance plants."
