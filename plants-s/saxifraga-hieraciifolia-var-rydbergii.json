    "intro": "Saxifraga hieraciifolia var. rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It features small, dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is closely related to other saxifrage species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
