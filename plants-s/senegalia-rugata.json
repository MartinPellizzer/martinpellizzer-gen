    "intro": "Senegalia rugata, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in adult plants, and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. Senegalia rugata is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
