    "intro": "Selliguea gracilipes, commonly known as the slender wall moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Selliguea gracilipes plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
