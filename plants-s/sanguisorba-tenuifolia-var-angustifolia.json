    "intro": "Sanguisorba tenuifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue along the leaf margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early summer, usually pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
