    "intro": "Stevia tenuis, commonly known as slender stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides, making it a popular natural sweetener. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Stevia tenuis is also valued for its medicinal properties, including potential use in reducing blood sugar levels."
