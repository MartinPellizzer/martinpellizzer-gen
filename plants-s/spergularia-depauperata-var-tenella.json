    "intro": "Spergularia depauperata var. tenella, commonly known as the slender sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, including dunes and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant resilience in extreme conditions."
