    "intro": "Selaginella montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella montevidensis is known for its ability to survive in a variety of soil conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
