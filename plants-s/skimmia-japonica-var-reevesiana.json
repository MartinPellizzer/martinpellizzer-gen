    "intro": "Skimmia japonica var. reevesiana, commonly known as the Japanese skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and emit a subtle fragrance when touched. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which add year-round interest to the landscape."
