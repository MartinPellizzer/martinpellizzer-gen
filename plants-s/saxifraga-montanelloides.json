    "intro": "Saxifraga montanelloides, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually oval or spatulate in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga montanelloides is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
