    "intro": "Symplocos laeteviridis var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu symplocos, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, spherical berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
