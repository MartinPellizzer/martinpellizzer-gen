    "intro": "Solanum multidissectum, commonly known as the dissected nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. It produces violet or purple berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken to avoid ingestion."
