    "intro": "Scirpus pileatus, commonly known as the purple bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often display a distinctive purple hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that appear in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize wetland soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Scirpus pileatus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
