    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 salischii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra, resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parent species. The plant is known for its slender, flexible stems and is often used in basket-making due to its fibrous bark. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and marshy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pale underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
