It is characterized by its clustered, spherical inflorescences that resemble small coral structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense, spherical clusters. This species is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological niche within its native range."
