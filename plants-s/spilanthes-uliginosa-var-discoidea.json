    "intro": "Spilanthes uliginosa var. discoidea, commonly known as the \"stinkweed\" or \"devil's bit,\" is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
