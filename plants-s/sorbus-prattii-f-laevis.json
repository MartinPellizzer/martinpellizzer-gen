    "intro": "Sorbus prattii f. laevis, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a botanical variant of the rowan tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Sorbus prattii. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
