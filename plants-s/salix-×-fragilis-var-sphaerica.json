    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. sphaerica, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a cultivar of the willow tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found near water bodies due to its preference for moist soils. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically light green on the upper surface and pale white underneath. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous catkins that appear in early spring, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The weeping willow is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping for its graceful appearance."
