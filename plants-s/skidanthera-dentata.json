    "intro": "Skidanthera dentata, commonly known as the serrated skunk cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, mottled purple and green leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its striking appearance. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Skidanthera dentata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with rhizomes that help it survive in waterlogged soils."
