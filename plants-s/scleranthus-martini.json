    "intro": "Scleranthus martini, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Scleranthus martini is generally not considered invasive and plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
