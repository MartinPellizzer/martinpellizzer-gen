    "intro": "Schoenoplectus \u00d7 contortus, commonly known as the twisted bulrush, is a hybrid wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that often twist and coil as they grow, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering spikes are usually green or reddish and appear in late summer. Schoenoplectus \u00d7 contortus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
