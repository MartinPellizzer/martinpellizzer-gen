    "intro": "Serratula mollis var. sprengeliana, commonly known as the Sprengel's velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky gardens. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
