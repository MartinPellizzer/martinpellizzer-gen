    "intro": "Sciaphila australasica, commonly known as the Australasian shade plant, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Australia and New Zealand. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and lanceolate, adapted to capture limited light in its shady habitat. Sciaphila australasica is known for its delicate structure and is often found growing in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
