    "intro": "Senecio convallium, commonly known as the narrowleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface and a slightly serrated edge. Senecio convallium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
