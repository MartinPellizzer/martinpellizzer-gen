    "intro": "Selinocarpus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada selinocarpus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, alpine climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
