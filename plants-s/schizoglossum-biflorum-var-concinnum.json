    "intro": "Schizoglossum biflorum var. concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved schizoglossum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
