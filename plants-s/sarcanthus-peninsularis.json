    "intro": "Sarcanthus peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Sarcanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus peninsularis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
