It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with fine hairs. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale golden flowers during the summer months, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
