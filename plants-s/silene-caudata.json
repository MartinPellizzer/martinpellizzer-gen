    "intro": "Silene caudata, commonly known as whippletree, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and can reach up to 1 meter in height. Silene caudata is also known for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance from its stems, which has been used traditionally by some Native American tribes."
