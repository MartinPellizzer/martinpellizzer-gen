    "intro": "Saxifraga micropetala, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Saxifraga micropetala is valued for its hardiness and is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
