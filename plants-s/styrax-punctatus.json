    "intro": "Styrax punctatus, commonly known as the spotted alder or spotted woodbine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters during late spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a glossy upper surface. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often marked with small, raised spots that give it its common name. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical uses in traditional medicine."
