    "intro": "Selago lepida, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink to purple and appear in late spring to early summer. Selago lepida is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil through its extensive root system."
