    "intro": "Stephanorossia palustris, commonly known as the marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in bogs or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Stephanorossia palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
