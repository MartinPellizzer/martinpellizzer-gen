    "intro": "Sarcobatus vermiculatus, commonly known as the sand sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater and survive in poor soil conditions. Sarcobatus vermiculatus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
