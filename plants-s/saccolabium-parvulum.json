    "intro": "Saccolabium parvulum, commonly known as the small-flowered saccolabium, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Saccolabium parvulum is often found in rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a resilient component of local flora."
