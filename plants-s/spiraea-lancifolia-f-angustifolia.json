    "intro": "Spiraea lancifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf weeping spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching branches that produce clusters of delicate, white or pinkish-pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a finely serrated margin, giving the plant a refined appearance. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden borders or small spaces. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
