It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria delicatula plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
