    "intro": "Selaginella angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear spores, a feature typical of many spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella angustifolia is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
