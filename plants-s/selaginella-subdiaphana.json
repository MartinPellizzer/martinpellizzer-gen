    "intro": "Selaginella subdiaphana, commonly known as the glassy spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, needle-like leaves that are often translucent or semi-transparent, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on separate stems and produce spores. Selaginella subdiaphana is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique morphological adaptations."
