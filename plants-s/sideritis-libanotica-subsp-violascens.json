It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture and a distinct appearance. Sideritis species are generally valued for their medicinal properties, and this subspecies is no exception."
