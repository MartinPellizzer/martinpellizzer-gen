    "intro": "Sorbus nubium, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red or orange berries in the autumn. Sorbus nubium is well adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
