    "intro": "Sedum balticum, commonly known as Baltic stonecrop, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to northern Europe and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid or rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on cliffs, walls, and in dry meadows. Sedum balticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
