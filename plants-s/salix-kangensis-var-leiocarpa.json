    "intro": "Salix kangensis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-sepaled willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and western Sichuan in China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth on both surfaces. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
