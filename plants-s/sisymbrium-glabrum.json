    "intro": "Sisymbrium glabrum, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a short, cylindrical pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Sisymbrium glabrum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
