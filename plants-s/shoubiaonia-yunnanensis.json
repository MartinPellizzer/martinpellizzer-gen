    "intro": "Shoubiaonia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan shoubiaonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in dense forests at higher altitudes. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Shoubiaonia yunnanensis is considered a conservation concern."
