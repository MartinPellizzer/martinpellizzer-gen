    "intro": "Specklinia aristata, commonly known as the aristate staghorn fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, attaching itself with its rhizomes and forming a dense, cascading structure. Its fronds are usually bright green with a waxy texture, and they often have a distinctive, spiky appearance at the tips. Specklinia aristata is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a decorative epiphyte in tropical gardens."
