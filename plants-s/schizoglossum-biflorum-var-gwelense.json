    "intro": "Schizoglossum biflorum var. gwelense, commonly known as the Gwelens mountain bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
