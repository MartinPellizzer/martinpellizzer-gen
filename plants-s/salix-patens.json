    "intro": "Salix patens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found near water sources and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
