    "intro": "Sphaeropteris hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan cycads, is a species of cycad native to the island of Hainan in China. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its native tropical climate. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sphaeropteris hainanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
