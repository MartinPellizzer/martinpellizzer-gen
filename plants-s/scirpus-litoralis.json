    "intro": "Scirpus litoralis, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. Scirpus litoralis plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
