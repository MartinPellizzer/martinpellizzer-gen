    "intro": "Sticherus melanoblastus, commonly known as the black-blasted sticherus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are borne on short, branched stalks and contain spores. Sticherus melanoblastus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
