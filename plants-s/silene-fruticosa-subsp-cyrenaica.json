    "intro": "Silene fruticosa subsp. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in areas of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Silene fruticosa subsp. cyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
