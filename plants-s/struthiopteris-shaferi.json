    "intro": "Struthiopteris shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's wood fern, is a species of tree fern native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of feather-like leaves that give it a unique, elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing near streams or in dense forest understories. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its humid habitat."
