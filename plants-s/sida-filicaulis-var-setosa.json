    "intro": "Sida filicaulis var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf sida, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, typical of the Malvaceae family. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a notable botanical feature that aids in identification."
