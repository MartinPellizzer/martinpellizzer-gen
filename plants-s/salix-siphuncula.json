    "intro": "Salix siphuncula, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves turn yellow in the fall, contributing to the seasonal color changes in its alpine habitat. Salix siphuncula is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
