    "intro": "Stipa commutata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Stipa commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
