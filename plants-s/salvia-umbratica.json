    "intro": "Salvia umbratica, commonly known as the shade sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and traditional medicinal uses."
