    "intro": "Sporobolus hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Sporobolus hintonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
