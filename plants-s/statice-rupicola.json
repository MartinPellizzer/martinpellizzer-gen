    "intro": "Statice rupicola, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy or rocky coastal soils, making it an important pioneer species in harsh environments. Statice rupicola is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardy nature and attractive floral display."
