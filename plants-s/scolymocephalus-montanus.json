    "intro": "Scolymocephalus montanus, commonly known as the mountain scolymus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its compact growth form. Its leaves are often silver or grayish, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Scolymocephalus montanus produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
