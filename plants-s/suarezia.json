    "intro": "Suarezia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are usually pale yellow or white. Suarezia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies due to their preference for moist environments."
