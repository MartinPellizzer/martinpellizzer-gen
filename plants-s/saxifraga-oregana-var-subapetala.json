    "intro": "Saxifraga oregana var. subapetala, commonly known as the Pacific coast saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is distinguished by its reduced petals, giving it a unique appearance compared to other saxifrage species."
