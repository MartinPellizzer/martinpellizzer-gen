    "intro": "Strychnos panamensis var. hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered strychnos, is a species of flowering plant in the Loganiaceae family. It is native to Central America, particularly Panama and parts of Colombia. The plant is characterized by its woody shrub form, with small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered with fine hairs, giving it the \"hairy\" descriptor in its name. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
