    "intro": "Scorzonella procera, commonly known as the tall scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and coastal habitats. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by achene fruits. Scorzonella procera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some regions for its edible roots."
