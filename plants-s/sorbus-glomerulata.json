    "intro": "Sorbus glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. Sorbus glomerulata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
