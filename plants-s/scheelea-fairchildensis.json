It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Scheelea fairchildensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
