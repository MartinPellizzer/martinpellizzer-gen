    "intro": "Scirpus costatus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in marshy or aquatic environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. This variety is distinguished from the typical Scirpus costatus by its more delicate and slender growth habit."
