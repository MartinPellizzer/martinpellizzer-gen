It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
