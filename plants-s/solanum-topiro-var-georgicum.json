    "intro": "Solanum topiro var. georgicum, commonly known as the Georgian nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically orange-red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
