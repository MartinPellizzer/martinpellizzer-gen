    "intro": "Specklinia subnulla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions against the foliage. This plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Specklinia subnulla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
