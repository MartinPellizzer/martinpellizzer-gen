    "intro": "Stelis ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features thin, wiry stems that often grow along tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are oval-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it capture moisture from the air. Stelis ovalifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
