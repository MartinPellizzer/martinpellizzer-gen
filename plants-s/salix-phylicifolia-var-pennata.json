    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. pennata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. The leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
