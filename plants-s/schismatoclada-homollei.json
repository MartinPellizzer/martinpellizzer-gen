    "intro": "Schismatoclada homollei, commonly known as the Moroccan goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish powder, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits. Schismatoclada homollei is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
