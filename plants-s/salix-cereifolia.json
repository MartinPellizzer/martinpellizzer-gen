    "intro": "Salix cereifolia, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, whitish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin and a smooth upper surface. The tree is often found growing near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
