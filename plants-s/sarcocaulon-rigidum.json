    "intro": "Sarcocaulon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, making it a temporary and elusive species. Due to its specialized nature, it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments where its hosts thrive."
