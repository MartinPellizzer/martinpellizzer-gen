    "intro": "Sagina afroalpina, commonly known as African alpine moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the high-altitude regions of Africa. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and small, pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous regions across Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
