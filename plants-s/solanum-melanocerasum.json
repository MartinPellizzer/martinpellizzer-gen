    "intro": "Solanum melanocerasum, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb with hairy, branched stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow with a distinctive purple calyx, and it thrives in disturbed soils and arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
