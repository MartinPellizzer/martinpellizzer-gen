It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect or semi-woody growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom in the evening. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
