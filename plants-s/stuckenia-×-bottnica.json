It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stuckenia litoralis and Stuckenia triqueta. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
