It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
