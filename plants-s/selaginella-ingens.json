    "intro": "Selaginella ingens, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
