    "intro": "Salvia calycinflata, commonly known as the California sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Salvia calycinflata plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
