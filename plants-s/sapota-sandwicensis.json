    "intro": "Sapota sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sapote, is a tropical tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by pear-shaped fruits with a thick, sweet, creamy pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and the tree is well adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in Hawaiian culture."
