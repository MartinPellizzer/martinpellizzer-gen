It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds that are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Syzygium fruticosum thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
