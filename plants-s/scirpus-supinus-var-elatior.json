    "intro": "Scirpus supinus var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a prominent feature in marshes and shallow water areas. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus supinus var. elatior is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soils."
