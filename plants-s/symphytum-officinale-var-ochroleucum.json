    "intro": "Symphytum officinale var. ochroleucum, commonly known as the white comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along streambanks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
