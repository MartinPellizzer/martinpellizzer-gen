    "intro": "Silene physocalycina, commonly known as the alpine sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and hairy. Silene physocalycina is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
