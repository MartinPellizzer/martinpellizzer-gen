    "intro": "Sorghum plumosum var. teretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It features slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and slightly rolled at the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to purplish flowers, which are often tinged with red or purple hues. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful, feathery appearance and drought tolerance."
