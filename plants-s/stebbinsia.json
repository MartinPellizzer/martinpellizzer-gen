    "intro": "Stebbinsia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow ray flowers that bloom in spring. Stebbinsia species are typically annual or biennial, with small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind. These plants play an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in their native habitats."
