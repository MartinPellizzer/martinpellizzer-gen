    "intro": "Stevia bertholdii, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from steviol glycosides, natural compounds found in its leaves. Stevia bertholdii is often cultivated as a sugar substitute due to its low calorie content and high sweetness. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial purposes."
