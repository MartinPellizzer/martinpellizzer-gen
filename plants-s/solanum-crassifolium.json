    "intro": "Solanum crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved nightshade, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, dark green leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and requires caution when handling."
