    "intro": "Scirpus caligenis var. tristigmatosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive leaf markings and its ability to thrive in a range of wetland environments."
