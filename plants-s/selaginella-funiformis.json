    "intro": "Selaginella funiformis, commonly known as the thread fern, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, thread-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella funiformis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
