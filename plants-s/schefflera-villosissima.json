    "intro": "Schefflera villosissima, commonly known as the silky schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera villosissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
