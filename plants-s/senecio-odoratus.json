It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
