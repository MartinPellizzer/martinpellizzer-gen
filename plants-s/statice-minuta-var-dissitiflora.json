    "intro": "Statice minuta var. dissitiflora, commonly known as dwarf statice, is a compact, flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It features small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, often arranged in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is typically found in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its botanical name reflects its small size (\"minuta\") and the arrangement of its flowers (\"dissitiflora,\" meaning scattered flowers)."
