    "intro": "Solanum oedipus, commonly known as the Oedipus nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
