    "intro": "Sansevieria perrotii, commonly known as the Tiger Tail Snake Plant, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features long, upright leaves that are dark green with prominent, vertical yellow or white stripes resembling a tiger's tail. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, making it ideal for low-maintenance indoor environments. Its leaves are stiff and sword-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Sansevieria perrotii is also known for its ability to purify indoor air, adding to its popularity as a decorative and functional houseplant."
