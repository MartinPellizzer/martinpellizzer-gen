    "intro": "Stenogyne nigra, commonly known as black stenogyne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with branched stems and opposite leaf arrangement. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from invasive species, Stenogyne nigra is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
