    "intro": "Stelis bolivarensis, commonly known as the Bolivian stelis, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Bolivia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
