    "intro": "Siphocampylus reflexifolius, commonly known as the reflexed leaf siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, reflexed leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
