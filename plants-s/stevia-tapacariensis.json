    "intro": "Stevia tapacariensis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, which appear in late spring. Stevia tapacariensis is valued for its natural sweetening properties and is used in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute."
