    "intro": "Swietenia velutina, commonly known as the velvet mahogany, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Meliaceae family, which includes other valuable hardwoods such as teak and satinwood. The tree is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its heartwood is highly prized for its rich color, durability, and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List."
