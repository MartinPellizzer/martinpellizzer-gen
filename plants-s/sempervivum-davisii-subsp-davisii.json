    "intro": "Sempervivum davisii subsp. davisii, commonly known as the Davis's houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can tolerate harsh weather conditions. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
