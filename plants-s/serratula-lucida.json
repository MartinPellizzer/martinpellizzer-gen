    "intro": "Serratula lucida, commonly known as the shining sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, serrated leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in temperate climates. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Serratula lucida is often considered a weed but has been used historically in traditional medicine."
