    "intro": "Styphelia filamentosa, commonly known as the threadleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, thread-like hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Styphelia filamentosa thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is an important component of the coastal heathland ecosystems in its native range."
