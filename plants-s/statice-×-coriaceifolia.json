    "intro": "Statice \u00d7 coriaceifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a hybrid perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. Statice \u00d7 coriaceifolia is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
