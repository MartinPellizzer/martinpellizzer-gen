    "intro": "Stipa baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spikelets that form a fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa baicalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
