    "intro": "Strongyloma axillare, commonly known as the axillary strongyloma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
