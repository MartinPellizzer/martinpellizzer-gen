    "intro": "Skimmia repens var. typica, commonly known as the creeping skimmia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal blooms."
