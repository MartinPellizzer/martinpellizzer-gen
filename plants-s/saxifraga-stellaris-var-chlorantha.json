    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. chlorantha, commonly known as the green star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky areas of Europe. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive greenish hue in the center. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in rock gardens."
