    "intro": "Salix chalaf, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, mountainous environments. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Salix chalaf plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
