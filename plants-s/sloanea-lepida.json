It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Sloanea lepida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to tropical and subtropical landscapes."
