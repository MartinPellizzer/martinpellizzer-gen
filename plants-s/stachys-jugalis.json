    "intro": "Stachys jugalis, commonly known as the purpleflower hedge-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or purple in color. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed or marginal environments. Stachys jugalis is characterized by its unique combination of hairy foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences."
