    "intro": "Strychnos angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain elliptical, smooth-seeded fruits. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
