    "intro": "Schrenkia involucrata, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in hot, dry climates with minimal water. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, clustered fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Schrenkia involucrata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
