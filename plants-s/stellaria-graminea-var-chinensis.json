    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its common name. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
