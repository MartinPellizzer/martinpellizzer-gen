    "intro": "Salix longifolia var. tenerrima, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, fluffy female flowers that appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. The leaves and twigs are used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
