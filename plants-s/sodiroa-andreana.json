    "intro": "Sodiroa andreana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sodiroa andreana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
