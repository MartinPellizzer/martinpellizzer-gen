    "intro": "Salix pseudolapponum var. kenosha, commonly known as the Kenosha willow, is a shrub native to the upper Midwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found along stream banks and in swampy areas. Its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in riparian zones."
