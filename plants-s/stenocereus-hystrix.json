    "intro": "Stenocereus hystrix, commonly known as the night-blooming organ pipe cactus, is a species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant is also known for its ability to form dense clumps, creating microhabitats for various desert organisms."
