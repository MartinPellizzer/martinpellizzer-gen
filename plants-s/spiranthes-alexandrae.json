    "intro": "Spiranthes alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's spirea, is a rare orchid species native to the coastal dunes of Oregon and Washington. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
