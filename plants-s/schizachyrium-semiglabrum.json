    "intro": "Schizachyrium semiglabrum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and dry woodland habitats. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a valuable component of native plant communities. Schizachyrium semiglabrum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species."
