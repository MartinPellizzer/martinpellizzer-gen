    "intro": "Stephania longifolia, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and shrubs. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The botanical structure of Stephania longifolia reflects its adaptation to tropical and subtropical environments, with a robust root system and efficient photosynthetic structures."
