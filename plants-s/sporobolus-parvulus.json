    "intro": "Sporobolus parvulus, commonly known as little needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a characteristic feature of many grass species. Sporobolus parvulus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
