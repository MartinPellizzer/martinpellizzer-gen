    "intro": "Salix armena, commonly known as Armenian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters, featuring slender, often twisted branches and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fragrant scent when crushed, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams or in forest edges. Salix armena is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
