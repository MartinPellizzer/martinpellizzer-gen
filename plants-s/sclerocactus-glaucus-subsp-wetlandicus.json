    "intro": "Sclerocactus glaucus subsp. wetlandicus, commonly known as the wetland cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the wetlands of the southwestern United States. It features a cylindrical stem covered in small, spiny segments that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to saturated soils. This subspecies is well-suited to moist environments, making it a unique member of the cactus family."
