    "intro": "Salix neilreichii, commonly known as the Neilreich willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky white hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
