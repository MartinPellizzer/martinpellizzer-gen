    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 laurentiana f. glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often near water bodies. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dense, powdery coating that gives them their characteristic silver sheen. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, and its growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various wetland environments."
