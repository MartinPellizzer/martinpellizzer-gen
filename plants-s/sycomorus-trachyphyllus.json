    "intro": "Sycomorus trachyphyllus, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and rough, fissured bark. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a nut-like seed. The fruit's outer husk is fibrous and separates from the hard, oily kernel inside. This species is valued for its economic importance, particularly for the production of shea butter from its seeds."
