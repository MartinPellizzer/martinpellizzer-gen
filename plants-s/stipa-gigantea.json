    "intro": "Stipa gigantea, commonly known as giant feather grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and feathery plumes that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their elegant appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that adds visual interest. Stipa gigantea thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
