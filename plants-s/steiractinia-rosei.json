    "intro": "Steiractinia rosei, commonly known as the rose-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety pink petals and a unique, fragrant scent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and November. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Steiractinia rosei is considered a conservation concern."
