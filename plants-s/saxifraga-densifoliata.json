    "intro": "Saxifraga densifoliata, commonly known as the dense-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, densely packed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
