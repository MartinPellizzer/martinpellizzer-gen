    "intro": "Salix pameachiana, commonly known as the Pamea willow, is a species of willow native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, often riparian habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
