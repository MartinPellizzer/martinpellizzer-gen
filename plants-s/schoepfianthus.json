It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often with a rounded or spreading crown. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, often greenish or yellowish in color, and the fruit is a small capsule containing several seeds."
