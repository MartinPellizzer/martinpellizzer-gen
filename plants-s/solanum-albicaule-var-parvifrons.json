    "intro": "Solanum albicaule var. parvifrons, commonly known as the small-fruited silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a red or orange color, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
