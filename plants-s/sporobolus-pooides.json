    "intro": "Sporobolus pooides, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the United States, particularly found in sandy and dry environments. It is a perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus pooides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
