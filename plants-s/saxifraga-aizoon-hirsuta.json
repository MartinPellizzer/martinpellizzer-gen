    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Mediterranean region. It typically features a compact rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, mountainous climates. Its hairy foliage and resilience to cold and drought make it a hardy ornamental plant in rock gardens and alpine settings."
