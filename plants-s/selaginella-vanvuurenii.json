    "intro": "Selaginella vanvuurenii, commonly known as the Van Vuuren's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals around its stems, which are often reddish in color. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella vanvuurenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems within its native habitat."
