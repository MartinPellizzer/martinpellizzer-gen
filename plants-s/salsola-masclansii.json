    "intro": "Salsola masclansii, commonly known as Russian thistle, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas. Salsola masclansii is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
