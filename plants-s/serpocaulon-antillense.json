It is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles. The plant is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
