    "intro": "Stalagmitis gutta, commonly known as the sticky gutta plant, is a unique species characterized by its gelatinous, resinous secretions. Its botanical features include a succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive scent that attracts specific pollinators. The resinous substance it exudes has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
