    "intro": "Stylidium asteroideum, commonly known as the star-shaped triggerplant, is a small flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred petals that resemble a star. The plant has a short, erect stem with opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, and they open in response to touch, a trait known as theriomorphism. Stylidium asteroideum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
