It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems that grow in dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
