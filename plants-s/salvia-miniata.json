    "intro": "Salvia miniata, commonly known as the scarlet salvia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia miniata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
