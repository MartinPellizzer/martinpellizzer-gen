    "intro": "Sulcorebutia purpurea var. unguispina, commonly known as the Purple Nightshade Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the high Andes of South America. It features dense, woolly gray-green stems that often branch into a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually absent, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic structures. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
