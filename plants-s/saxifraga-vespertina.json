    "intro": "Saxifraga vespertina, commonly known as the evening saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, hence its common name. Its leaves are usually basal, clustered at the base, and have a slightly succulent texture. Saxifraga vespertina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
