    "intro": "Sideroxylon domingense, commonly known as the Dominican ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often elliptical in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
