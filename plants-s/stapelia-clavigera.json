    "intro": "Stapelia clavigera, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost corpse-like appearance. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Stapelia clavigera is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
