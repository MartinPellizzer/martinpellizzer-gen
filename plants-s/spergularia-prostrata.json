    "intro": "Spergularia prostrata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, often pink or white flowers. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is commonly found in coastal areas, dunes, and other arid or disturbed habitats. Spergularia prostrata is well adapted to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to spread vegetatively."
