It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
