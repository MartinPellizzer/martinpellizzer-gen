    "intro": "Sagina reuteri var. capillaris, commonly known as moss campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features tiny, closely spaced leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
