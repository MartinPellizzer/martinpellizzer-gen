    "intro": "Saponaria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces woolly, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The genus Saponaria is known for its saponin-containing sap, which can produce a soapy lather when crushed."
