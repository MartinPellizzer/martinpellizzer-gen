    "intro": "Saxifraga glabella var. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to retain moisture in its harsh alpine environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in meadows and scree slopes at elevations above 2,000 meters."
