    "intro": "Salix elaeagnifolia, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Silver willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
