    "intro": "Smilax woodii, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorned stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Smilax woodii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground cover."
