    "intro": "Saccolabium steffensii var. tomohonensis, commonly known as Tomohon's sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of northern Sulawesi, Indonesia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pod-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
