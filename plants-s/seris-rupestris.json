    "intro": "Seris rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Seris rupestris is often found growing on rocky slopes and in dry, well-drained soils."
