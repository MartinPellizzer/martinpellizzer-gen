    "intro": "Silene odontopetala, commonly known as the toothed petal campion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers with distinctive toothed petals, which are typically arranged in a clustered inflorescence. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Silene odontopetala is a perennial species that plays a role in supporting pollinators in its cold, high-altitude ecosystems."
