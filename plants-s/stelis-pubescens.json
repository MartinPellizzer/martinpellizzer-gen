It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, short hairs, giving it the \"hairy\" descriptor in its common name. Stelis pubescens thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests."
