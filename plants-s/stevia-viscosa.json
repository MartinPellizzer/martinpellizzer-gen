    "intro": "[WRONG START] S-tevia viscosa, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are the primary source of steviol glycosides, which are used as natural sweeteners. Stevia viscosa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its botanical properties make it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and modern food industries."
