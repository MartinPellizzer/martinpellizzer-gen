    "intro": "Stapelia planiflora, commonly known as the flat-flowered stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, star-shaped flowers that resemble small, decaying animal carcasses. The plant produces pale yellow to orange blooms that emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically small and rounded, adapted to store water in arid environments. Stapelia planiflora is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
