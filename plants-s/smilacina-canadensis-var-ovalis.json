    "intro": "Smilacina canadensis var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-stemmed greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, climbing stems with a smooth, greenish-brown bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, often with a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in forest understories."
