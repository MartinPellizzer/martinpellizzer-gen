    "intro": "Setaria glauca var. dura, commonly known as rough fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a hardy species in arid environments. Its adaptability and resilience make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
