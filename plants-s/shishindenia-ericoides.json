    "intro": "Shishindenia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 inches, featuring dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Shishindenia ericoides is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
