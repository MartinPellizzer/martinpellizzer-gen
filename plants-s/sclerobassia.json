    "intro": "Sclerobassia, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plants are characterized by their compact, evergreen foliage and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Sclerobassia species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they require well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. These plants are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
