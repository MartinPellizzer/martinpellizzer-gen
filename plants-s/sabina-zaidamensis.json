    "intro": "Sabina zaidamensis, commonly known as the Zaidam juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spherical blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabina zaidamensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
