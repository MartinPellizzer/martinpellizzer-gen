    "intro": "Solanum cyananthum, commonly known as the blue-flowered nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. The plant produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Solanum cyananthum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
