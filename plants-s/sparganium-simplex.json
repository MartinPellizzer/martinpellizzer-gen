    "intro": "Sparganium simplex, commonly known as the narrowleaf bur-reed, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, spiky, cone-like flower heads that develop in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its flowers are initially yellow and later turn reddish, attracting various pollinators. Sparganium simplex plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
