    "intro": "Symplocos altissima, commonly known as the tall wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, waxy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Symplocos altissima is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
