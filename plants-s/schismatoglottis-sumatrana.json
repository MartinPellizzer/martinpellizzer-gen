It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid environment.
