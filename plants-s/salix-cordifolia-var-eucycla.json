    "intro": "Salix cordifolia var. eucycla, commonly known as the heartleaf willow, is a shrub native to the wetlands and riparian zones of eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are male and female flowers arranged in separate clusters. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along streams, marshes, and other waterlogged habitats. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
