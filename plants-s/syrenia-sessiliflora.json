It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Syrenia sessiliflora thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
