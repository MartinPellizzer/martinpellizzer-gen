    "intro": "Silene integripetala subsp. elaphonesiaca, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
