    "intro": "Selaginella leoneensis, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to parts of Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the base of the plant and produce spores for propagation. Selaginella leoneensis is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
