    "intro": "Stylidium graminifolium f. grandiflorum, commonly known as the grandiflorum form of the grass-leaved triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, spurred flowers. The flowers are typically bright red or orange, with a distinctive trigger-like structure that aids in pollination by insects. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more showy blooms compared to the typical form of Stylidium graminifolium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
