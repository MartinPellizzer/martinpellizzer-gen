    "intro": "Saussurea pseudotridactyla, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest in traditional medicine and is also studied for its potential ecological roles in alpine ecosystems."
