It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, pale green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by hard, woody fruits containing edible nuts. The nuts are rich in oils and have been traditionally used for food and medicinal purposes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
