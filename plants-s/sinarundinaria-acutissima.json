    "intro": "Sinarundinaria acutissima, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are pinnately compound with lance-shaped pinnae, and the spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds."
