    "intro": "Solanum campylacanthum var. ellipsoideum, commonly known as the elliptic-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces berries that transition from green to yellow or red as they mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticultural settings."
