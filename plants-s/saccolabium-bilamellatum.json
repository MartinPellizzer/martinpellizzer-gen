    "intro": "Saccolabium bilamellatum, commonly known as the two-lipped milkweed, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers with five lobes, typically arranged in clusters. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, and it serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species. Saccolabium bilamellatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
