    "intro": "Silene parnassica subsp. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Pindus Mountains in northern Greece. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pinkish-red flowers and hairy, linear leaves. This subspecies thrives in rocky and calcareous soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. It is a perennial plant with a low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of less than 20 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
