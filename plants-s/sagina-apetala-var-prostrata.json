    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or gravelly slopes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in harsh climates."
