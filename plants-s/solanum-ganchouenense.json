    "intro": "Solanum ganchouenense, commonly known as the Ganchouen nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its berries, which are usually yellow or orange when ripe, contain toxic alkaloids and are not edible for humans or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum ganchouenense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
