    "intro": "Saussurea masarica, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with its robust root system. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Saussurea masarica is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
