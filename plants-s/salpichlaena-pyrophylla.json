It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red or orange spore-bearing fronds, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a unique, almost fiery appearance. Salpichlaena pyrophylla is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
