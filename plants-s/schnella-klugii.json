    "intro": "Schnella klugii, commonly known as the Klug's schnella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schnella klugii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
