    "intro": "Scirpus rehmannii, commonly known as the reed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue. Scirpus rehmannii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
