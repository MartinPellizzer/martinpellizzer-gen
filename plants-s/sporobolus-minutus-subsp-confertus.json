    "intro": "Sporobolus minutus subsp. confertus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a low-growing habit with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
