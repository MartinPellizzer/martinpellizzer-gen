    "intro": "Serjania sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran serjania, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture adapted to conserve water. Serjania sonorensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its resilience to drought conditions."
