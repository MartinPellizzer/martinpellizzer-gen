    "intro": "Selaginella lindigii, commonly known as the Lindig's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features a stem that bears whorls of scale-like leaves, and it produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila. Selaginella lindigii is characterized by its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing tissues. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
