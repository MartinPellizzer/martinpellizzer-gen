    "intro": "Salvia brachiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet or blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Salvia brachiata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
