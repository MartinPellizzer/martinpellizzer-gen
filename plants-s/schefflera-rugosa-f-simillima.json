    "intro": "Schefflera rugosa f. simillima, commonly known as the rough-leaved schefflera, is a variant of the Schefflera genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery, and often rough-textured leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Its foliage makes it an attractive choice for indoor decoration and landscaping."
