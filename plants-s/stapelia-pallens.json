    "intro": "Stapelia pallens, commonly known as the white-stemmed starfish plant, is a succulent belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that resemble a starfish. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia pallens is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
