    "intro": "Specklinia vaginata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, velvety fronds that are often covered in a fine, soft layer of trichomes. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
