    "intro": "Strychnos hachensis, commonly known as the Hach\u00e9's strychnos, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often found in dry, scrubland habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
