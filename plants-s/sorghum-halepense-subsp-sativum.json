    "intro": "Sorghum halepense subsp. sativum, commonly known as millet, is a grass species native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable crop in arid environments. Its grains are used for food, animal feed, and brewing, while the plant itself is also used for thatching and construction. The subspecies sativum is distinguished by its cultivated traits and agricultural significance compared to its wild relatives."
