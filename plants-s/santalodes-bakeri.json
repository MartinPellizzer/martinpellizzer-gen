    "intro": "Santalodes bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by animals, and it thrives in shaded, moist forest environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
