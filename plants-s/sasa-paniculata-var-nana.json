    "intro": "Sasa paniculata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf bamboo, is a low-growing, clump-forming plant native to Japan. It features slender, erect culms that are typically no taller than 30 centimeters, making it ideal for small garden spaces. The plant produces clusters of tiny, light green to white flowers in early summer, followed by small, triangular-shaped leaves. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, preferring moist, cool conditions. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
