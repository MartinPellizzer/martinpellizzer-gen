    "intro": "Specklinia icterina, commonly known as the golden speckled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with yellow or golden spots, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its leaves are usually divided into narrow segments. Specklinia icterina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for under the right conditions."
