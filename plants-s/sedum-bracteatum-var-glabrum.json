It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it is often found growing on rock surfaces or in sandy soils. It is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
