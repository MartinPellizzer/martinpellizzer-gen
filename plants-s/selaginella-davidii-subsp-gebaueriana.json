    "intro": "Selaginella davidii subsp. gebaueriana, commonly known as the Gebauer's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves. It is a perennial evergreen plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, a trait known as poikilohydry, which allows it to withstand periods of drought. Its sporophyte produces microsporangia and megasporangia, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This subspecies is native to regions of East Asia, including China and Vietnam, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems."
