    "intro": "Sorbus hybrida var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its pinnately lobed leaves, which are often finely toothed and have a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, persistent berries that provide food for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to landscape designs."
