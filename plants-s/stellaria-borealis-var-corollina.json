    "intro": "Stellaria borealis var. corollina, commonly known as the Arctic starflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in extreme northern climates."
