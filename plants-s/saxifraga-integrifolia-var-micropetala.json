    "intro": "Saxifraga integrifolia var. micropetala, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to silver hair, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
