    "intro": "Setaria gracilis var. glaucocaesia, commonly known as blue false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
