    "intro": "Sorbus carpinifolia, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by small, persistent berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. Sorbus carpinifolia is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks."
