    "intro": "Salix hastata var. tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It typically blooms later in the spring compared to other willow species, hence its common name. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats."
