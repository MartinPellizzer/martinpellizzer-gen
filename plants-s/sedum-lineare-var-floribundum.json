It features fleshy, linear leaves that are often blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
