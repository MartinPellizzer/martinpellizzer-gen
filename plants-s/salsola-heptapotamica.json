It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It often grows in sandy or saline soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed habitats. Salsola heptapotamica plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native ecosystems."
