    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. dilatatum, commonly known as the Andean tomato, is a botanical variant of the wild tomato species native to the Andes. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. The plant is an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves, typical of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to extreme climates."
