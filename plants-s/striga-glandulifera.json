    "intro": "Striga glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy, and often sticky leaves, which can trap insects and aid in its survival. It is native to Africa and is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to reduce crop yields. Striga glandulifera plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both plant and insect communities."
