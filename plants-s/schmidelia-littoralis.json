    "intro": "Schmidelia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, showcasing its adaptation to saline and wind-prone environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs that help reduce water loss. Schmidelia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
