    "intro": "Sesbania erubescens, commonly known as the red sesbania, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, flat pods containing several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils due to its rapid growth habit. Sesbania erubescens is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
