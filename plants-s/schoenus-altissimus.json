    "intro": "Schoenus altissimus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a prominent feature in marshy and aquatic environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schoenus altissimus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
