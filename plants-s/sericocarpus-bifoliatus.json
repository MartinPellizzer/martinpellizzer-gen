    "intro": "Sericocarpus bifoliatus, commonly known as the two-leaved huskweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces unique, spiny fruits known as sericocarps, which are covered in a silky, hair-like coating. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
