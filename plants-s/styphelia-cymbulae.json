    "intro": "Styphelia cymbulae, commonly known as the tufted wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved, contributing to its compact, mat-forming growth habit. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Styphelia cymbulae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
