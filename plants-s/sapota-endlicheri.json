    "intro": "Sapota endlicheri, commonly known as the Mexican sapote, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, yellow fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns from green to yellow or orange, and it is valued for its edible, mildly sweet flesh. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing canopy."
