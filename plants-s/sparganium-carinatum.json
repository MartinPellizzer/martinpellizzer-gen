    "intro": "Sparganium carinatum, commonly known as the spiked bur reed, is a perennial wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and distinctive, spiky, cone-shaped inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds. Sparganium carinatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
