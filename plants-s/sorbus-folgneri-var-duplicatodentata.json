    "intro": "Sorbus folgneri var. duplicatodentata, commonly known as the double-toothed whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring double teeth along the margins, which set it apart from other Sorbus species. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, persistent fruits that provide food for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
