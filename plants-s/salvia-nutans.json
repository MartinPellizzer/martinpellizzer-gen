    "intro": "Salvia nutans, commonly known as the nodding sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens. Salvia nutans is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
