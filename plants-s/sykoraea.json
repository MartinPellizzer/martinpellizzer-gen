    "intro": "Sykoraea, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact herbaceous perennial, often cultivated for its ornamental value. Sykoraea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom year-round makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
