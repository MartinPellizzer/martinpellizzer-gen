    "intro": "Selaginella roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often reddish in color, especially when young. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Selaginella roxburghii is notable for its ability to survive in adverse conditions, including drought and partial shade, making it a resilient component of many ecosystems."
