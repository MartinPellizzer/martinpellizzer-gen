    "intro": "Sarothra laxa f. repens, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sarothra laxa f. repens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats."
