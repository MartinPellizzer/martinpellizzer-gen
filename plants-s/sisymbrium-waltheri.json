    "intro": "Sisymbrium waltheri, commonly known as the Walther's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to regions of the western United States and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
