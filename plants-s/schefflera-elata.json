    "intro": "Schefflera elata, commonly known as the Hawaiian umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Schefflera elata is also valued for its ability to tolerate shade and its air-purifying properties."
