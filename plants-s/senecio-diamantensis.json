    "intro": "Senecio diamantensis, commonly known as the diamond plant, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage covered in tiny, diamond-shaped white or silver markings, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
