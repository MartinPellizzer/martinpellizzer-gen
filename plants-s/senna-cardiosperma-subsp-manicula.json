    "intro": "Senna cardiosperma subsp. manicula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
