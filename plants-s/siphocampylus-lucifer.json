    "intro": "Siphocampylus lucifer, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral bracts, which resemble flames, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, Siphocampylus lucifer is considered a conservation concern."
