    "intro": "Saxifraga biternata f. persecta, commonly known as the spotted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white or grayish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
