    "intro": "Siphocampylus nemoralis f. hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's rock cress, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine and rocky habitats. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often in crevices or on rock faces. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
