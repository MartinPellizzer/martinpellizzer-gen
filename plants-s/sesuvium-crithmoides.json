    "intro": "Sesuvium crithmoides, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and salt-tolerant, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid conditions. Sesuvium crithmoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
