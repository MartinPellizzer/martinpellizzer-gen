    "intro": "Solidago nitida, commonly known as frostweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Solidago nitida is known for its ability to thrive in cool, humid environments and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
