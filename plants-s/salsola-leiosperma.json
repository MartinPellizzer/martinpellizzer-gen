    "intro": "Salsola leiosperma, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its adaptation to harsh, saline soils. Salsola leiosperma is often found in disturbed sites and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
