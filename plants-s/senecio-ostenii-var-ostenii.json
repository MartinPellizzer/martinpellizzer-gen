    "intro": "Senecio ostenii var. ostenii, commonly known as the Ostenii groundsels, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a cluster at the stem's apex. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
