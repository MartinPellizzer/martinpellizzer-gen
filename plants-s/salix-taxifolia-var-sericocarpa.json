    "intro": "Salix taxifolia var. sericocarpa, commonly known as silky willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, though it can reach tree-like proportions under favorable conditions. The silky texture of its leaves and the graceful appearance of its branches make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in wetland and riparian habitats."
