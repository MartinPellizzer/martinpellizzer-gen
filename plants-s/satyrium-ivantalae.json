    "intro": "Satyrium ivantalae, commonly known as the Ivantalae orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces a single, narrow spike bearing several small, lance-shaped flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the harsh, cold environments of its habitat. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
