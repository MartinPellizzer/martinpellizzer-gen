    "intro": "Sphaeranthus bullatus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spherical, hairy inflorescence that resembles a small globe, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are yellow with prominent central disks, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Sphaeranthus bullatus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm climates."
