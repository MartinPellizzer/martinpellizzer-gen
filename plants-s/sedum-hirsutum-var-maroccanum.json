    "intro": "Sedum hirsutum var. maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan wooly sedum, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
