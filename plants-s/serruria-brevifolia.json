    "intro": "Serruria brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf serruria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
