It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in marshy or waterlogged soils. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
