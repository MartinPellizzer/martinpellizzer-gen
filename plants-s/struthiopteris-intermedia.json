    "intro": "Struthiopteris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
