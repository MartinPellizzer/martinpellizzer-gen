    "intro": "Stachys elliptica var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered betony, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in dense, hairy foliage and produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green due to their pubescent surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
