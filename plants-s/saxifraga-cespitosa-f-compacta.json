The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are relatively small but numerous. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, decorative plant."
