    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. typica, commonly known as the rowan tree or mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish-orange berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with finely toothed margins. It produces white, flat-topped flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive berries. The rowan tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
