    "intro": "Salix incompta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to various regions of Europe and Asia, typically growing in moist, temperate environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The bark of Salix incompta is thin and fibrous, and it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
