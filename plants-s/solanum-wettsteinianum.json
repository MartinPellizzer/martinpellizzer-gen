    "intro": "Solanum wettsteinianum, commonly known as the Wettstein's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are typically red or purple when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids that make it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes studied for its chemical compounds and ecological role in its native habitat."
