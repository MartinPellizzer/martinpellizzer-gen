    "intro": "Seseli daucifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
