    "intro": "Sagina saginoides subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as mountain sagina, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tiny, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to form extensive carpets, which help prevent soil erosion. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Sagina genus, sharing similar morphological traits and ecological preferences."
