It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, often covering the entire tree in a fiery display. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid climates."
