    "intro": "Salvia rascheyana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly habitats. Salvia rascheyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
