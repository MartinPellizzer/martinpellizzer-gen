    "intro": "Solanum stagnale, commonly known as the swamp nightshade, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark purple color and contain toxic alkaloids. Solanum stagnale plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for certain insects and animals."
