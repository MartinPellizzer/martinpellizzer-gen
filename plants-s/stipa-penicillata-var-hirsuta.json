    "intro": "Stipa penicillata var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble a brush. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. Its hairy texture is due to the presence of dense pubescence on the stems and leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control."
