    "intro": "Salix arctica subvar. oblonga, commonly known as the arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, oblong leaves and small, catkin-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife. Its woody stems and persistent leaves allow it to survive extreme temperature fluctuations and limited sunlight."
