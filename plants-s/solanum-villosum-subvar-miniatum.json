    "intro": "Solanum villosum subvar. miniatum, commonly known as the dwarf hairy nightshade, is a small shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by small, spherical berries. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
