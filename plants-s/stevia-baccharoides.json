    "intro": "Stevia baccharoides, commonly known as desert stevia, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with succulent stems and leaves that store water. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is related to other members of the stevia genus. While not widely used for its sweet compounds like other stevia species, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
