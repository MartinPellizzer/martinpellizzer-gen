    "intro": "Spermacoce tenuissima, commonly known as the slender moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, nocturnal flowers that open at night. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Spermacoce tenuissima is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
