    "intro": "Stachys procumbens, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Stachys procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
