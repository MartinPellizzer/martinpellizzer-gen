    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoides f. flava, commonly known as the yellow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is distinguished by its bright yellow flowers, which contrast with its green foliage, making it a striking addition to rock gardens."
