    "intro": "Sterculia apetala, commonly known as the white sterculia, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, and it bears woody, spiny capsules containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is also valued for its durable timber and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
