    "intro": "Senecio pleopterus, commonly known as the wooly senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a unique texture. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio pleopterus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
