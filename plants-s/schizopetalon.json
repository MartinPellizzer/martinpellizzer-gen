    "intro": "Schizopetalon, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five to ten petals. The leaves are typically palmately divided, giving the plant a delicate and fern-like appearance. Schizopetalon species are often found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in partial shade. These plants are known for their attractive blooms but can be toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of protoanemonin."
