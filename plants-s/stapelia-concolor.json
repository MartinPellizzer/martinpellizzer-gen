    "intro": "Stapelia concolor, commonly known as the pale star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. These flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Stapelia concolor is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
