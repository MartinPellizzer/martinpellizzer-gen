    "intro": "Salicornia alpini subsp. carinata, commonly known as the alpine glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and alkaline soils. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its salt tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid and coastal environments."
