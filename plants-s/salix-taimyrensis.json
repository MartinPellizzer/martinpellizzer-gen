    "intro": "Salix taimyrensis, commonly known as the Taimyr willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Russia. It is adapted to cold climates and grows in tundra and taiga environments. The plant has slender, often multi-stemmed branches and produces catkins as its reproductive structures. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Salix taimyrensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
