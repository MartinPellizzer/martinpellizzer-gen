    "intro": "Saxifraga pilifera, commonly known as the hairleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Saxifraga pilifera is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
