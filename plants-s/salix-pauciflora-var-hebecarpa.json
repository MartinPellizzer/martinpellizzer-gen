    "intro": "Salix pauciflora var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring, followed by distinctive, elongated capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
