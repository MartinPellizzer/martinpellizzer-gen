    "intro": "Scleria bracteata f. simplicior, commonly known as the simple-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to parts of Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The leaves are usually shorter and more simplified in structure compared to the typical form of the species."
