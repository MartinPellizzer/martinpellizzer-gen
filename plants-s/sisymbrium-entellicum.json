    "intro": "Sisymbrium entellicum, commonly known as field radish, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe, it has also been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
