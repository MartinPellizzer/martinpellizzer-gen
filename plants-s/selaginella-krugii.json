    "intro": "Selaginella krugii, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, low-growing plant that typically forms dense, cushion-like mats, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cones at the tips of the stems. Selaginella krugii is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
