It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along the shores of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Scrophularia littoralis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
