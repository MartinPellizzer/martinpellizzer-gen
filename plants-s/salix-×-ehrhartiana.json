    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ehrhartiana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the United Kingdom. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (White Willow) and Salix triandra (Caucasian Willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive weeping branches. The tree has long, slender, pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a cascading effect. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often planted near water bodies for its ornamental value."
