    "intro": "Spiraea \u00d7 fontenaysii rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its graceful, arching branches. It produces clusters of pinkish-white to rose-colored flowers in early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are dark green and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact size and showy blooms make it an excellent addition to borders or as a specimen plant."
