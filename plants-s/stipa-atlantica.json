    "intro": "Stipa atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant has slender, grass-like blades and produces small, spikelike inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local flora. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
