    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites subsp. controversa, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine tundra and mountain meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
