    "intro": "Salvia rouyana var. parvifrons, commonly known as the small-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a grayish-green hue and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
