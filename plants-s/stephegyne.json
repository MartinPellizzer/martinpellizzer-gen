    "intro": "Stephegyne, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their spiny stems and large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale in color and emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Stephegyne species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits."
