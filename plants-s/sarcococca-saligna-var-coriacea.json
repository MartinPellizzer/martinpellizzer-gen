It features dense, glossy dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its small, fragrant white flowers appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its year-round foliage and winter blooms."
