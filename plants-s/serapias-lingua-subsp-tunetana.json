It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny and well-drained environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
