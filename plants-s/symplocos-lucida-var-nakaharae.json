    "intro": "Symplocos lucida var. nakaharae, commonly known as the Nakahara's shining evergreen, is a variant of the shining evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along forest edges. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, particularly for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
