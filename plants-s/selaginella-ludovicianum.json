    "intro": "Selaginella ludovicianum, commonly known as the rock spruce, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded, humid environments. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a spore-producing gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Selaginella ludovicianum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptive species."
