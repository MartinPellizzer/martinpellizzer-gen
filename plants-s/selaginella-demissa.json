    "intro": "Selaginella demissa, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like structures called strobila. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions through its ability to retain moisture in its tissues. Selaginella demissa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
