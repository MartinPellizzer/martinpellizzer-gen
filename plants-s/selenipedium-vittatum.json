    "intro": "Selenipedium vittatum, commonly known as the velvet tassel orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and its unique, pendulous inflorescences that resemble tassels, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and the plant produces a distinctive, velvety texture on its leaves. Selenipedium vittatum is a slow-growing species that thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
