    "intro": "Sisymbrium lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a unique, branched stem covered in fine, hairy structures. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
