    "intro": "Scirpus gracillimus, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender, grass-like stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers that appear in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize wetland soils, making it an important species for ecological restoration. Scirpus gracillimus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
