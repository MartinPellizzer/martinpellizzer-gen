    "intro": "Silene saxifraga var. pseudosaxifraga, commonly known as the false saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Native to rocky or alpine environments in Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
