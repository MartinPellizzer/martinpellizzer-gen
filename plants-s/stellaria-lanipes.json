    "intro": "Stellaria lanipes, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has a sprawling or ascending growth habit. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a soft, woolly texture that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat."
