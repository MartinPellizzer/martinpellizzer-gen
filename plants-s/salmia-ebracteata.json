    "intro": "Salmia ebracteata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
