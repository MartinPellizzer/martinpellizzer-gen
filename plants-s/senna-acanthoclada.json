It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
