    "intro": "Shuteria ferruginea f. pauciflora, commonly known as the rusty shuteria, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from reddish-brown to orange, which are often covered in a rust-colored bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is found in specific regions of South Africa. Its foliage is narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
