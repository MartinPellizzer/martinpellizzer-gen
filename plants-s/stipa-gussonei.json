It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often arranged in tufts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Stipa gussonei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
