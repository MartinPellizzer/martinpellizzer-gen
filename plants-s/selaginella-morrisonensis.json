    "intro": "Selaginella morrisonensis, commonly known as the Morrison's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. Selaginella morrisonensis is known for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in certain regions of Australia."
