    "intro": "Sagina linnaei f. maritima, commonly known as the sea saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shores and dunes where it withstands salt spray and wind. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Its flowers are white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
