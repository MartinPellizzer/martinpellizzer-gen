    "intro": "Sphaeropteris novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia cyclosorus, is a fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited geographic distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
