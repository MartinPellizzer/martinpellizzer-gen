    "intro": "Stellaria hiemalis, commonly known as winter starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, oval seeds in its fruiting bodies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. Its botanical name reflects its star-like flowers and its tendency to appear in the winter months."
