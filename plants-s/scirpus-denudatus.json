    "intro": "Scirpus denudatus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Scirpus denudatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
