    "intro": "Stylocoryna oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved stylocoryna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant exhibits a woody stem with a fibrous root system. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
