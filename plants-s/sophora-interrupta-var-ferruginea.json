    "intro": "Sophora interrupta var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically feathery and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are often followed by elongated, woody pods containing small, flat seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. The species is also known for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
