    "intro": "Schefflera pachyclada, commonly known as the thick-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are attractive to birds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera pachyclada is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
