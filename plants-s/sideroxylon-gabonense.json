    "intro": "Sideroxylon gabonense, commonly known as African ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Central and West Africa. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has smooth, dark grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape.

The tree is well adapted to tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
