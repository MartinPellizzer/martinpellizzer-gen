    "intro": "Spergula rubra subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in the Mediterranean region. It has small, needle-like leaves that are typically reddish in color, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in coastal areas and open habitats where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh environments, and it is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
