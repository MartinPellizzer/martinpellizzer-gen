    "intro": "Senecio peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments, often on limestone soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
