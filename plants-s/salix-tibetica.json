    "intro": "Salix tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan willow, is a species of willow native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant has slender, flexible branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It produces catkins as its flowers, which are typical of the Salix genus. This hardy species is adapted to high-altitude conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
