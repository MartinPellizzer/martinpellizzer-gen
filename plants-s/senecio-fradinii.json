    "intro": "Senecio fradinii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Senecio fradinii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
