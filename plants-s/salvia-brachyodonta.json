    "intro": "Salvia brachyodonta, commonly known as the Mexican bush sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering period attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia brachyodonta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
