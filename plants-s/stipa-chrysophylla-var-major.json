    "intro": "Stipa chrysophylla var. major, commonly known as the golden feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more golden in the sun. The inflorescence consists of a tall, cylindrical spike that is often adorned with soft, silky hairs, contributing to its visual appeal in gardens and natural landscapes."
