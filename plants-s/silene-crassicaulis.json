    "intro": "Silene crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed campion, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene crassicaulis is also known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions, making it a common sight in tundra and mountainous areas."
