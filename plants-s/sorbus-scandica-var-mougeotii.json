    "intro": "Sorbus scandica var. mougeotii, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
