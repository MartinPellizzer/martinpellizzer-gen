    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia var. concolor, commonly known as the white meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue, often turning yellow in the fall. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
