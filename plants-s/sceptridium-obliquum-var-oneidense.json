    "intro": "Sceptridium obliquum var. oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida fern, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that sets it apart from other ferns. This plant is native to the northeastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest habitats. It has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and is considered a living fossil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often found in protected environments such as bogs and wetlands."
