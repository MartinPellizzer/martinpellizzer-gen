    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 alatum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the parent plant, which can be easily propagated. Its flowers are typically pink or red, appearing in clusters at the center of the rosette. Sempervivum \u00d7 alatum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
