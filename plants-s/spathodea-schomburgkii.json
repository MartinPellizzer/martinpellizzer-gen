    "intro": "Spathodea schomburgkii, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters within the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its vibrant appearance. Spathodea schomburgkii is also valued for its fast growth and ability to provide shade in tropical landscapes."
