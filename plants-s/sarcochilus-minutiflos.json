    "intro": "Sarcochilus minutiflos, commonly known as the miniature flower saxifrage, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It features a compact, low-growing habit with a rhizomatous root system and a single, often leafless stem. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Sarcochilus minutiflos is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique growth form."
