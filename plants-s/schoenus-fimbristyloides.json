    "intro": "Schoenus fimbristyloides, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas and seasonally flooded soils. Its small, clustered flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Schoenus fimbristyloides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
