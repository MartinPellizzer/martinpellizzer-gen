    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and has arrow-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for waterfowl. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
