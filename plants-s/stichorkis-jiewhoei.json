    "intro": "Stichorkis jiewhoei, commonly known as the Jiewhoei orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, featuring showy, often fragrant blossoms that attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stichorkis jiewhoei is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
