    "intro": "Stenostephanus guerrerensis, commonly known as the Guerrerensis orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
