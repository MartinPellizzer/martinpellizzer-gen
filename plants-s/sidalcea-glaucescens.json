    "intro": "Sidalcea glaucescens, commonly known as the blue flax or plains flax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, powdery blue coating. Sidalcea glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
