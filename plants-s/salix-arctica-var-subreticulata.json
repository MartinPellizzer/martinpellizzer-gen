    "intro": "Salix arctica var. subreticulata, commonly known as the Arctic willow subvariety with reticulate bark, is a shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and catkin flowers, typical of the Salix genus. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on tundra or rocky slopes. Its bark is distinctive, featuring a finely reticulated pattern that provides structural support in harsh conditions. This subvariety plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
