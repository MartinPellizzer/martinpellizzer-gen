    "intro": "Swartzia elegans, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Swartzia elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. However, it is not widely used for commercial purposes due to its limited growth rate and specific environmental requirements."
