    "intro": "Stenotus brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's stenotus, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
