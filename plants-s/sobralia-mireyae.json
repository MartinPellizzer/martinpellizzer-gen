    "intro": "Sobralia mireyae, commonly known as the Mireyae's Sobralia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that are often more showy than its actual flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid blooms during the rainy season, producing fragrant, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators."
