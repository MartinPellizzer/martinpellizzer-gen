    "intro": "Simira, commonly known as the \"Indian cherry\" or \"wild cherry,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink in color. Simira species produce small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow when mature. These berries are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
