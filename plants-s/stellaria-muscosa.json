    "intro": "Stellaria muscosa, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Stellaria muscosa is often found in clusters, with its compact growth habit helping it to retain moisture and withstand environmental stress."
