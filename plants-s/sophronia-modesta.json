    "intro": "Sophronia modesta, commonly known as the modest sophronia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature of the Apiaceae family. Sophronia modesta is often overlooked due to its unassuming appearance, but it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
