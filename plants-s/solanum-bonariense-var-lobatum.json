It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that mature to a dark purple color, which are often toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
