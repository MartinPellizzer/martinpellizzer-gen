    "intro": "Sarcochilus minimifolius, commonly known as the miniature leaf saxifrage, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
