    "intro": "Spachea sericea, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa and is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. Spachea sericea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
