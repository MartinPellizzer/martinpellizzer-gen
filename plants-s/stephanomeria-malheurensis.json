It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
