It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces small, bright red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks."
