    "intro": "Sida rhombifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its seeds are small and numerous, allowing for easy dispersal by wind and animals. Sida rhombifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
