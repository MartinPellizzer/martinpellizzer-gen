    "intro": "Scyphostelma granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scyphostelma granatensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
