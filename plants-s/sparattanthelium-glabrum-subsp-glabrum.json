    "intro": "Sparattanthelium glabrum subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sparrow's-beak, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
