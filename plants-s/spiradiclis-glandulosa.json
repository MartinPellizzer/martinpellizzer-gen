    "intro": "Spiradiclis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular spiradiclis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its glandular structures on the stems and leaves help in water retention and may play a role in chemical defense. Spiradiclis glandulosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
