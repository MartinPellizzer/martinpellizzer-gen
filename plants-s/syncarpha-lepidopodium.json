    "intro": "Syncarpha lepidopodium, commonly known as the woolly synbranch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which provide protection against harsh environmental conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. Syncarpha lepidopodium produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
