    "intro": "Sida fallax, commonly known as the silverleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in the summer months. Sida fallax is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
