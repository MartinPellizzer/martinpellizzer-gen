    "intro": "Swartzia stipularis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with stipules, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. Swartzia stipularis is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in some regions."
