    "intro": "Seriphidium kermanense, commonly known as Kerman wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Seriphidium kermanense is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions."
