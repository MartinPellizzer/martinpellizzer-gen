    "intro": "Stephanostegia holophaea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved stephanostegia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
