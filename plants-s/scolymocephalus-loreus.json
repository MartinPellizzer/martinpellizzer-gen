    "intro": "Scolymocephalus loreus, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are erect and often branched, with a tendency to become woody at the base over time. Scolymocephalus loreus is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
