    "intro": "Staurogynopsis, commonly known as the star-shaped sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Actinioidea. It is characterized by its distinctive star-like body structure, with a central column surrounded by multiple tentacles. The plant, or more accurately the organism, thrives in shallow coastal waters, particularly in rocky substrates. Its tentacles are equipped with cnidocytes, specialized cells used for capturing prey. Staurogynopsis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of reef environments."
