It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with fine, hairy hairs to protect against cold temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a bluish-gray hue. Stellaria longipes var. arctica thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments."
