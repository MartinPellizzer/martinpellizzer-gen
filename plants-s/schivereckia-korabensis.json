    "intro": "Schivereckia korabensis, commonly known as the Korab mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkans, specifically the Korab Mountains in North Macedonia and Kosovo. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at high elevations. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, with five petals and a distinctive spur. Schivereckia korabensis is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and has a limited geographic range, making it a species of conservation concern. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche within its native habitat."
