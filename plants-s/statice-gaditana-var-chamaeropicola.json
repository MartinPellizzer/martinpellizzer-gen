    "intro": "Statice gaditana var. chamaeropicola, commonly known as the coastal statice, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The species is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the summer season."
