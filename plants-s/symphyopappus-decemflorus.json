    "intro": "Symphyopappus decemflorus, commonly known as the ten-flowered symphyopappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and papery bracts. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Symphyopappus decemflorus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny habitats."
