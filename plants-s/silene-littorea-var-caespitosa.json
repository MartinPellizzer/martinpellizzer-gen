It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
