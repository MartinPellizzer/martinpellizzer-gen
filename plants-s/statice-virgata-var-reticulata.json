    "intro": "Statice virgata var. reticulata, commonly known as the laceflower or sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, branched inflorescences that produce small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal and maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, white powder that helps reduce water loss. The species is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
