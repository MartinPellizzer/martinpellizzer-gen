    "intro": "Salix basraensis, commonly known as the Basra willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are usually yellow-green and appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, saline soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
