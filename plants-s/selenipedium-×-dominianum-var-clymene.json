    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 dominianum var. clymene, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble spider-like structures, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, recurved lip. The plant is a hybrid between Selenipedium dominianum and Selenipedium clymene, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
