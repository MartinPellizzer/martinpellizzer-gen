    "intro": "Spirotropis, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiral-shaped inflorescences that give them their common name. They are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Namibia. The leaves are typically strap-like and narrow, while the flowers are showy and often come in shades of white, pink, or red. Spirotropis species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
