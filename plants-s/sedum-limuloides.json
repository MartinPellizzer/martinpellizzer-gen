    "intro": "Sedum limuloides, commonly known as the stonecrop or liveforever plant, is a succulent species native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum limuloides is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to prevent soil erosion in dry environments."
