    "intro": "Seaforthia minor, commonly known as the dwarf seaforthia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. It is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and preventing erosion. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
