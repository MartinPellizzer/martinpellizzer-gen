It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine. Scilla pneumonanthe thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
