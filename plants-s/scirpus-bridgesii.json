It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus bridgesii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
