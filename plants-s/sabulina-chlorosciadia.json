    "intro": "Sabulina chlorosciadia, commonly known as the white sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky or sandy substrates. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sabulina chlorosciadia is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy, often brightly colored blooms."
