    "intro": "Spiraea opulifolia var. glabra, commonly known as smooth spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and have a slightly hairy texture. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
