It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean flora and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
