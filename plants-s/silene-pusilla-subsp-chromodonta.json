    "intro": "Silene pusilla subsp. chromodonta, commonly known as the dwarf campion, is a small flowering plant native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small stature, usually under 10 cm tall, makes it a delicate and often overlooked component of its ecosystem. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different flower coloration and habitat preferences compared to other subspecies of Silene pusilla."
