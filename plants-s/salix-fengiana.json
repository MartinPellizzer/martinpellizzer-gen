    "intro": "Salix fengiana, commonly known as the Fengshan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
