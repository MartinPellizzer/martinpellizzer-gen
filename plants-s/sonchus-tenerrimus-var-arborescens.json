    "intro": "Sonchus tenerrimus var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like sow thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, giving it a tree-like appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
