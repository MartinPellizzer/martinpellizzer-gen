    "intro": "Shrirangia, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs with woody stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a rough or hairy texture. The flowers, which are usually blue or violet, are borne in clusters and attract various pollinators. Shrirangia plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic value."
