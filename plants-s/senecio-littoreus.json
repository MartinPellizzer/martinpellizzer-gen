    "intro": "Senecio littoreus, commonly known as coastal groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Senecio littoreus plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
