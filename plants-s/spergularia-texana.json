    "intro": "Spergularia texana, commonly known as Texas sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as plains and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Spergularia texana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
