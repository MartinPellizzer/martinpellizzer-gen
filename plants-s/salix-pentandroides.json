    "intro": "Salix pentandroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix pentandroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
