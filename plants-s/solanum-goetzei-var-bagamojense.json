    "intro": "Solanum goetzei var. bagamojense, commonly known as the Bagamojo nightshade, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, yellow berries that contain the toxic alkaloids typical of the Solanum genus. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is sometimes studied for its chemical composition."
