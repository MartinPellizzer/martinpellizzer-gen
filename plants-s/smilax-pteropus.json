    "intro": "Smilax pteropus, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and stout, spiny tendrils that help it climb and support its growth. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax pteropus is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
