    "intro": "Scorzonera intermedia, commonly known as the common scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a stout, fleshy root system that is often harvested for its edible tubers, which have a slightly sweet and nutty flavor. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple or brownish hue at the base, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Scorzonera intermedia is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
