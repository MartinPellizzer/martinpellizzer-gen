    "intro": "Selaginella wightii var. venusta, commonly known as the velvet clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
