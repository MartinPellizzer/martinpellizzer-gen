    "intro": "Sabulina bilykiana, commonly known as the Bilyk's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
