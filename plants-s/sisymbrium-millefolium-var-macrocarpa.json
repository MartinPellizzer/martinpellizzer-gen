    "intro": "Sisymbrium millefolium var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded wild radish, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are divided into many narrow segments, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
