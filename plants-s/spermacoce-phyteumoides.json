    "intro": "Spermacoce phyteumoides, commonly known as the African star grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling stars, hence its common name. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Spermacoce phyteumoides is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
