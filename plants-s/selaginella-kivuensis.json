    "intro": "Selaginella kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and small, scale-like leaves that form a rosette structure. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Selaginella kivuensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
