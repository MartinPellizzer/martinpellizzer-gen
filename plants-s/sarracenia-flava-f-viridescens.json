    "intro": "Sarracenia flava f. viridescens, commonly known as the green-flowered pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a naturally occurring form of Sarracenia flava, distinguished by its unique greenish-yellow floral coloration instead of the typical orange-red hue. The plant features tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. Its foliage is usually a vibrant red or orange, contrasting with the pale green flowers. This form is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and ecological interest."
