    "intro": "Saponaria orientalis, commonly known as the oriental soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Its roots contain saponins, which are natural detergents responsible for its common name. Saponaria orientalis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
