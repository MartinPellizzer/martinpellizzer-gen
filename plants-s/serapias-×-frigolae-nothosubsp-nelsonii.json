    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 frigolae nothosubsp. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's hybrid orchid, is a rare and hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Serapias frigolae and another related species. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring vividly colored petals and a distinctive labellum. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is a short-lived perennial, often found in rocky or gravelly areas with limited vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
