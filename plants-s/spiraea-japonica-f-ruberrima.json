    "intro": "Spiraea japonica f. ruberrima, commonly known as the redleaf weeping spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its weeping growth habit and profuse clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves of this variety are a striking reddish-bronze color, which intensifies in the fall, adding ornamental value throughout the growing season. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or container planting. This cultivar is prized for its vibrant foliage and delicate floral display, though it may require pruning to maintain its shape and promote repeat blooming."
