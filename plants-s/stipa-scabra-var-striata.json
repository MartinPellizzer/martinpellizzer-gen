    "intro": "Stipa scabra var. striata, commonly known as the stripe grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its distinctive striped appearance, caused by contrasting coloration on the leaf surfaces, makes it easily identifiable."
