    "intro": "Schiedea hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the family Cichorioideae and is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Schiedea hawaiiensis thrives in the high-elevation, sunny areas of Haleakal\u0101 Crater, where it has adapted to the harsh, dry conditions. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
