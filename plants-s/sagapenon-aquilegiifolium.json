    "intro": "Sagapenon aquilegiifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf sagapenon, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
