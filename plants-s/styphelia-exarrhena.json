    "intro": "Styphelia exarrhena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact form and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia exarrhena is often found in heathlands and sand dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
