    "intro": "Statice viminea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Mediterranean basin. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like flower clusters that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and tidal zones. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it blooms from late summer into autumn. Statice viminea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
