    "intro": "Stroemia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms using its bladder-like structures, which are specialized for capturing prey. These bladders are filled with air and can rapidly inflate to ensnare unsuspecting prey. Stroemia trifoliata typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches."
