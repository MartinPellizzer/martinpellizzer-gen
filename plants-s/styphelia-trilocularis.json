It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and sandplain habitats. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued plant in native gardens and conservation efforts."
