    "intro": "Silene douglasii var. multicaulis, commonly known as the Douglas's catchfly, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clustered stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is notable for its ability to produce multiple stems from a single root system, contributing to its resilience in challenging habitats."
