    "intro": "Scirpus polyphyllus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the giant bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, often growing in dense stands. The plant produces large, branched inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and is important for wetland ecosystems. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological and potential economic value."
