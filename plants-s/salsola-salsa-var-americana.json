    "intro": "Salsola salsa var. americana, commonly known as American sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Salsola salsa var. americana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
