    "intro": "Stenogyne konaensis, commonly known as Kona ironwood, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Hawaii. It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the mesic to wet forest zones. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native insects and birds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
