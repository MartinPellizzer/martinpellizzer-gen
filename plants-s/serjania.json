    "intro": "Serjania, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or seringa, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sericini. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their woody structure and showy, often fragrant flowers. Serjania species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals, and are pollinated by insects. Some species are valued for their wood, which is used in the manufacture of musical instruments and furniture."
