    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris var. glaucus, commonly known as the blue bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and lake margins. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that mature into dark brown, cylindrical spikelets. Its leaves are usually a striking blue-green color, which distinguishes it from other bulrush species. Scirpus lacustris var. glaucus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
