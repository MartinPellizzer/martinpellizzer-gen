    "intro": "Solanum merkeri, commonly known as the Merker's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is typically found in humid, lowland forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Solanum merkeri is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
