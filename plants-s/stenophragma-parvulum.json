    "intro": "Stenophragma parvulum, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, and its berries are typically red or yellow when mature. Stenophragma parvulum plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries."
