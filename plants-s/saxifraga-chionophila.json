    "intro": "Saxifraga chionophila, commonly known as the snow saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, rocky environments, often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes and low temperatures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against harsh weather. Saxifraga chionophila is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
