    "intro": "Selaginella tortipila, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Selaginella tortipila is also recognized for its spore-producing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems."
