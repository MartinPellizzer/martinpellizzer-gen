    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 discolor var. medusa, commonly known as the Medusa Stapelia, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a dark center, resembling the mythological creature Medusa. Its leaves are usually absent, and it relies on its stems for photosynthesis. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
