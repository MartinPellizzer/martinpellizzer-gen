    "intro": "Santolina sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai santolina, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with a strong aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Santolina sinaica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
