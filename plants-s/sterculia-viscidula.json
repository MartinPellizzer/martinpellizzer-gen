    "intro": "Sterculia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky sterculia, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, often sticky bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The sticky resin exuded by the bark is one of its distinguishing features and has been used traditionally in some indigenous cultures."
