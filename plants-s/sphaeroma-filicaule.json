    "intro": "Sphaeroma filicaule, commonly known as the leafy sea dragon, is a species of sea dragon found in the coastal waters of southern Australia. It is a marine animal belonging to the family Syngnathidae, which includes seahorses and pipefish. The plant-like appearance of Sphaeroma filicaule is due to its elaborate, branched appendages that resemble foliage. It is characterized by its translucent, leafy structures that provide camouflage in seaweed beds. These appendages are not true leaves but are modified dorsal fin rays that aid in swimming and protection."
