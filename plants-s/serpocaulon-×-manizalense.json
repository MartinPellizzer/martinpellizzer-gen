    "intro": "Serpocaulon \u00d7 manizalense, commonly known as the Manizales fern, is a hybrid species native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a subtle reddish hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Serpocaulon \u00d7 manizalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
