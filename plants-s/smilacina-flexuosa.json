    "intro": "Smilacina flexuosa, commonly known as greenbrier, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Smilacina flexuosa is often found in the understory of deciduous forests, where it uses its tendrils to climb toward sunlight."
