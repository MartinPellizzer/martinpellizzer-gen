    "intro": "Sida calchaquiensis, commonly known as the Chaco sida, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the arid regions of Bolivia and Argentina. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its fibrous stems and hairy foliage are features that help it conserve water in its native environment."
