    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 wrigleyana, commonly known as the Wrigley's pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright sunlight for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically white or yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique carnivorous behavior."
