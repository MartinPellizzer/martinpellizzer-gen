    "intro": "Selago michelliae, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Selago michelliae thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
