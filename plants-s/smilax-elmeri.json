    "intro": "Smilax elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Smilax elmeri is typically found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory flora in its native habitat."
