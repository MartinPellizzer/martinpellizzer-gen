    "intro": "Stelis ascensor, commonly known as the skyward orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis ascensor thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
