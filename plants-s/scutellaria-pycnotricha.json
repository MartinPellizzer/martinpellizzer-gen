    "intro": "Scutellaria pycnotricha, commonly known as the dense-haired skullcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scutellaria pycnotricha is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique dense pubescence on the leaves and stems helps to reduce water loss and protect against harsh environmental conditions."
