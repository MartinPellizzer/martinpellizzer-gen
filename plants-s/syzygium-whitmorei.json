    "intro": "Syzygium whitmorei, commonly known as the Bornean apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and horticultural studies."
