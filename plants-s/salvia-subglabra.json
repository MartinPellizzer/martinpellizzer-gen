    "intro": "Salvia subglabra, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Salvia subglabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal practices."
