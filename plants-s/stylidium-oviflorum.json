    "intro": "Stylidium oviflorum, commonly known as the oval-flowered sun-orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique structure where the flower stem bends to touch the pollinia. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Stylidium oviflorum is often found in sandy soils and is a common sight in coastal and inland regions of Australia."
