    "intro": "Selenipedium chica subsp. buenaventurae, commonly known as the Buenaventura's selenipedium, is a rare and striking member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy inflorescences that resemble a crown of flowers. Native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to habitat disturbance and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
