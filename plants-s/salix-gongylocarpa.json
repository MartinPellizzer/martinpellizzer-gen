    "intro": "Salix gongylocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix gongylocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
