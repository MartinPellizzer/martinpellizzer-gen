    "intro": "Spiraea tuberosa, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has arching stems covered in fine, hairy leaves. Its root system is tuberous, which helps it survive in various soil conditions. Spiraea tuberosa is often found in moist meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
