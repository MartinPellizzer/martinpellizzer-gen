    "intro": "Spergella saginoides var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, erect stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. This variety is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually reduced to scales, and it produces small, delicate flowers with five petals. The plant is a carnivorous species, relying on its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
