    "intro": "Sarcochilus psiloglottis, commonly known as the pink-tongued orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces showy, pinkish-brown flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum that resembles a tongue. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a dense, velvety coating to reduce water loss. This orchid is typically found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
