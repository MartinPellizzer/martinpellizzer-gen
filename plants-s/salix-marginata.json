    "intro": "Salix marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver along the edges. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green and arranged in clusters. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny locations. Salix marginata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
