    "intro": "Schoenus vacillans, commonly known as the wavering sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Schoenus vacillans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
