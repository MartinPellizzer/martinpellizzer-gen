    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
