    "intro": "Spirotecoma spiralis, commonly known as the spiral spike moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of leaf-like structures that form a compact, cushion-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinctive spiral pattern when viewed from above. Spirotecoma spiralis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small invertebrates."
