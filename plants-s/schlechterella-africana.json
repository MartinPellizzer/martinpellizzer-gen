    "intro": "Schlechterella africana, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem with numerous small, clustered flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Schlechterella africana is also noted for its ability to thrive in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
