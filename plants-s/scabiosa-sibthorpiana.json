    "intro": "Scabiosa sibthorpiana, commonly known as the mountain scabious, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces delicate, pink or white flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
