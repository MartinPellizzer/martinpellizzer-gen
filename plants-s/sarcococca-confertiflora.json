    "intro": "Sarcococca confertiflora, commonly known as the fragrant winterberry, is a evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in late winter, followed by red berries that persist into spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which provide winter interest."
