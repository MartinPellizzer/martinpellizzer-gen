    "intro": "Smithia conferta var. geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered snowbell, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help insulate it against harsh mountain conditions. Its flowers, which appear in clusters of two, are small and white, giving it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
