It features tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of violet to purple flowers with distinctive red or purple spots. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are slightly hairy and emit a strong, minty fragrance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and aromatic foliage, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
