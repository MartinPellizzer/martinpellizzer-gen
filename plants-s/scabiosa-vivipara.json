    "intro": "Scabiosa vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces both vegetative and reproductive structures, with its unique feature being the production of live young plants on the stems, a process known as viviparity. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa vivipara is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
