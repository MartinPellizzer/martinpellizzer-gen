    "intro": "Solanum polytrichum var. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces berries that transition from green to yellowish-red as they mature, often containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
