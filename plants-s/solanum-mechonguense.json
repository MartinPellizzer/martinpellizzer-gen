    "intro": "Solanum mechonguense, commonly known as the Mechonguense nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
