    "intro": "Salix flaveola, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest edges. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a yellowish-green underside. Salix flaveola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
