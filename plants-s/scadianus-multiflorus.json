    "intro": "Scadianus multiflorus, commonly known as the multibloom scadian, is a striking flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant blossoms that range in color from pale blue to deep violet. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in the rich, moist soil. Scadianus multiflorus is primarily pollinated by bees and butterflies, making it an important species for local biodiversity."
