    "intro": "Sideritis arborescens var. faurei, commonly known as the Faure's rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild aromatic properties."
