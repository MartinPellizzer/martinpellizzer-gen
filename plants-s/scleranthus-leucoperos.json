    "intro": "Scleranthus leucoperos, commonly known as white sand-scented grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive sand-like texture, contributing to its common name. Scleranthus leucoperos is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
