    "intro": "Scrophularia jankae, commonly known as the Jank\u00e1 scrophularia, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic and non-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and tubular flowers. It blooms during the summer months, producing violet to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
