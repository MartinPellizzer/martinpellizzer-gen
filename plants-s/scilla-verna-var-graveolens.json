    "intro": "Scilla verna var. graveolens, commonly known as the common scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
