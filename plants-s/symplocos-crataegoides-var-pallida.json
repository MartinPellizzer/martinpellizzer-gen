It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually pale green and covered in fine, whitish pubescence.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
