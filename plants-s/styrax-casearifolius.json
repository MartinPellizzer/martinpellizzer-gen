It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn a striking golden yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds.

Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
