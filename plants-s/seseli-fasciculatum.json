    "intro": "Seseli fasciculatum, commonly known as clustered seseli, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse via wind. Seseli fasciculatum is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
