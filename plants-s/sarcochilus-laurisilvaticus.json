It is characterized by its large, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of fronds. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal and lowland forests. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
