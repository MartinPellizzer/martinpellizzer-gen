    "intro": "Stylocoryna nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense, fan-like pattern. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
