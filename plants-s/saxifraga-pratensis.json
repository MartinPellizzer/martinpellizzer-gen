    "intro": "Saxifraga pratensis, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga pratensis is known for its ability to tolerate partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
