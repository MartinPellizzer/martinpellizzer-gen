    "intro": "Sanrobertia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum sanrobertia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky, arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
