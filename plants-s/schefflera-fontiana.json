It features a dense, rounded canopy with large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Schefflera fontiana is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its adaptability to different soil types."
