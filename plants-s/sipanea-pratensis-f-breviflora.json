    "intro": "Sipanea pratensis f. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered form of the meadow sipanea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more condensed inflorescences compared to the typical form. The leaves are typically pinnately divided, with a hairy surface that aids in moisture retention. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations."
