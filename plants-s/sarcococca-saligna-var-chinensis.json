It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, boxwood-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness. This variety is often used in landscaping for its neat form and ability to tolerate pruning."
