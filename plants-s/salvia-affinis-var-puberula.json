    "intro": "Salvia affinis var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and also bear a fuzzy texture due to the same glandular hairs. It produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
