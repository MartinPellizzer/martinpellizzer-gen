It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. This variety is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar structural and chemical characteristics."
