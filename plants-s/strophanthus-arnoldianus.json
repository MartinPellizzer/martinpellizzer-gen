    "intro": "Strophanthus arnoldianus, commonly known as the African Crownbeard, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring woody stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant is renowned for its showy, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright orange or red berries. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
