    "intro": "Schnella reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on the trunks of trees rather than in the ground. Schnella reflexa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
