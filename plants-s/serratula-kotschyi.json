It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climates. Its leaves are usually serrated and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.
