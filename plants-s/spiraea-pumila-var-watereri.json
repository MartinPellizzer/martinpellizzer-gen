    "intro": "Spiraea pumila var. watereri, commonly known as the creeping spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, upright clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its foliage is typically dark green, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize slopes in horticultural and ecological settings."
