    "intro": "Solanum lanceifolium var. scabrum, commonly known as the roughleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
