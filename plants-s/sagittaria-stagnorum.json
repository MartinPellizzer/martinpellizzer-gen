    "intro": "Sagittaria stagnorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender stems that support its flowering spikes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments. Sagittaria stagnorum is an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes in aquatic environments."
