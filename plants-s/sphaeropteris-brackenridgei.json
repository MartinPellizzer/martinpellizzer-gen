    "intro": "Sphaeropteris brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
