    "intro": "Stemodia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican stemodia, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster, and it produces small, hairy fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
