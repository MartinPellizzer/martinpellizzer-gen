    "intro": "Senecio sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe-headed senecio, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in rounded, globe-like inflorescences. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
