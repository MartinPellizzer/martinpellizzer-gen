    "intro": "Spergularia rubra subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, saline conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
