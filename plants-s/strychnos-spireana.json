    "intro": "Strychnos spireana, commonly known as the African spurge, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for livestock and humans. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and savannas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by herbivores, which helps it survive in competitive environments."
