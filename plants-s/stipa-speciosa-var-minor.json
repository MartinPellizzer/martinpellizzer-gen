    "intro": "Stipa speciosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, silver-blue foliage that forms a dense, low-growing clump. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are particularly prominent in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide texture and movement in the landscape."
