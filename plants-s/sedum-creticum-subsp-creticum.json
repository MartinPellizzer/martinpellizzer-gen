    "intro": "Sedum creticum subsp. creticum, commonly known as Cretan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
