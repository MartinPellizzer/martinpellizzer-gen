    "intro": "Solanum ellipticum var. horridum, commonly known as the rough potato vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its elliptical, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple or black color. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
