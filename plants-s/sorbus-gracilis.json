    "intro": "Sorbus gracilis, commonly known as the slender whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Sorbus gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural landscapes."
