It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its leaves are typically ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential adaptability to different environmental conditions."
