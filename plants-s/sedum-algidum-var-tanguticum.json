    "intro": "Sedum algidum var. tanguticum, commonly known as the Tangut stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically in late summer. It is well adapted to rocky soils and harsh climates, making it a hardy species for alpine gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
