    "intro": "Salix jessoensis, commonly known as the Korean willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers. Salix jessoensis is adapted to moist, temperate climates and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands."
