It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and gardeners alike."
