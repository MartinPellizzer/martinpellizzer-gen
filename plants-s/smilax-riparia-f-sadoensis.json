    "intro": "Smilax riparia f. sadoensis, commonly known as the Sado River Smilax, is a variant of the common smilax, native to Japan. It is a climbing plant characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to cling to supports. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along riverbanks and in forest understories. This form is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical species."
