    "intro": "Sium conium, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is toxic due to the presence of various alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be fatal to humans and animals. Despite its dangers, it has been historically used in folk medicine and as a hallucinogenic substance."
