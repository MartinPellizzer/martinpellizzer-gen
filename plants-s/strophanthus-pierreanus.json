    "intro": "Strophanthus pierreanus, commonly known as the African blood vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its latex contains cardioactive compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
