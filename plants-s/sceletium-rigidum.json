    "intro": "Sceletium rigidum, commonly known as kanna, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is often found in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves contain psychoactive compounds, including kanna alkaloids, which have been traditionally used by indigenous communities. The plant's unique morphology and chemical composition make it an interesting subject for botanical and pharmacological study."
