    "intro": "Sonchus lowei, commonly known as the Hawaiian sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and forest edges. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster. Sonchus lowei is considered a non-native invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native flora."
