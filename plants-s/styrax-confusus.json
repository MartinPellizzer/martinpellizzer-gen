    "intro": "Styrax confusus, commonly known as the Chinese styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Styrax confusus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
