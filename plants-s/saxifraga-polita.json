    "intro": "Saxifraga polita, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are usually pink or white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in early summer. Saxifraga polita is adapted to withstand extreme cold and is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
