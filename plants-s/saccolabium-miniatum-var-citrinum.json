    "intro": "Saccolabium miniatum var. citrinum, commonly known as the yellow milkbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its bark is thick and corky, providing protection against extreme temperatures and drought. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
