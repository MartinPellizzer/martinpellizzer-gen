    "intro": "Salvia clausa, commonly known as the closed sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Salvia clausa is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
