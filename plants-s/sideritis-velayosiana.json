    "intro": "Sideritis velayosiana, commonly known as the Velayos' ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
