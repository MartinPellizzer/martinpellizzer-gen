    "intro": "Stelis dejavu, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are narrow and often appear in a rosette formation. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
