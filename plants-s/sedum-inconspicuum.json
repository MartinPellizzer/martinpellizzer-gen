    "intro": "Sedum inconspicuum, commonly known as the small sedum or dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky crevices, gravelly soils, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
