    "intro": "Sebaea procumbens, commonly known as the rock fig, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
