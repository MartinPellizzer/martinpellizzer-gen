    "intro": "Silene vulgaris var. oleracea, commonly known as garden catchfly, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and garden beds, and is known for its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves. Silene vulgaris var. oleracea is also a host plant for certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
