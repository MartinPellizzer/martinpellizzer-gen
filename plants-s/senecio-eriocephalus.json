    "intro": "Senecio eriocephalus, commonly known as the blueweed or desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its blue to purple flower heads are composed of numerous tiny florets, and the plant produces a distinctive, woolly appearance on its leaves. Senecio eriocephalus is often found in open habitats and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
