    "intro": "Spiranthes rufescens, commonly known as the rusty spike-rush, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces slender, spirally arranged spikes of pale yellow to reddish-brown flowers, which bloom from late summer to early fall. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in moist environments. Spiranthes rufescens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
