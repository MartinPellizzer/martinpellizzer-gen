    "intro": "Sobralia maduroi, commonly known as the Maduro's sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant features pendulous, brightly colored flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.
