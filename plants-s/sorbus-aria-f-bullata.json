    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. bullata, commonly known as the bullate whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its thickened, warty bark and its unique, rounded fruit clusters. The plant is native to southern England and is often found in woodland habitats. Its foliage consists of elliptical leaves with a serrated edge, and it produces small, white flowers in spring. Due to its rarity, it is considered a conservation priority and is often protected in its natural habitat."
