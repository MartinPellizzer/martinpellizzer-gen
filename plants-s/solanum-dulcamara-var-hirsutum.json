It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, which bloom in summer. Its fruits are bright red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it a plant to handle with care. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
