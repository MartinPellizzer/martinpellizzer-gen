    "intro": "Selaginella lychnuchus var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are often a dark green color. It produces strobila (spore-bearing structures) that are clustered at the tips of its stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variety is noted for its ability to survive in humid conditions and its unique morphology that resembles both mosses and ferns."
