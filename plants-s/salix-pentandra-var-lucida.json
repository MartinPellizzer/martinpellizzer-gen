    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. lucida, commonly known as the shining willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and provide food for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable environments."
