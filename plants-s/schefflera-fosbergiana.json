    "intro": "Schefflera fosbergiana, commonly known as Fosberg's umbrella tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to the island of Molokai in Hawaii and is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
