    "intro": "Senecio cuspidatus var. ceratophyllus, commonly known as the horned senecio, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems with dense clusters of small, spiky, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a specimen plant."
