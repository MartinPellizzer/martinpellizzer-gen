    "intro": "Sabulina uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sandplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal areas of western North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower atop a slender stem, typically in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Sabulina uniflora plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
