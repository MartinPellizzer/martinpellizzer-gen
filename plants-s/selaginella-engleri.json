    "intro": "Selaginella engleri, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its clustered, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. Selaginella engleri is characterized by its ability to reproduce via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of many primitive vascular plants. It is also known for its resilience, capable of surviving in poor soil conditions and with minimal water."
