    "intro": "Santalodes diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized root structures that absorb nutrients from host plants. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, often fragrant bark, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically white or pale yellow. Santalodes diversifolium is known for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range."
