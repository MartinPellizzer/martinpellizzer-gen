    "intro": "Salix myrtilloides subsp. ustnerensis, commonly known as the Sierra willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. This subspecies is adapted to semi-arid environments and plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
