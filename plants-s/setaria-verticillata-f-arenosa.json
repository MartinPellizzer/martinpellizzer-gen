    "intro": "Setaria verticillata f. arenosa, commonly known as sanddropgrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, bract-like structures. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. Its morphology reflects its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
