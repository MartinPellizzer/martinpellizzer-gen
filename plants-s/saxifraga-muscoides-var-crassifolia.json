    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features dense, mat-forming growth with fleshy, dark green leaves that are broad and rounded. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Saxifraga muscoides var. crassifolia is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
