    "intro": "Sphenopholis pensylvanica var. flexuosa, commonly known as the Pennsylvania sphenophyll, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Sphenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble those of early vascular plants. This variety is notable for its unique branching pattern and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often considered a living fossil with important evolutionary insights."
