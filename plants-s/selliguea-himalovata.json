    "intro": "Selliguea himalovata, commonly known as the Himalayan moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a thallus that is usually green or yellowish-green, with a smooth or slightly ridged surface. Selliguea himalovata is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are well developed and contribute to its role in forest ecosystems."
