    "intro": "Sedum acre var. virescens, commonly known as pale stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
