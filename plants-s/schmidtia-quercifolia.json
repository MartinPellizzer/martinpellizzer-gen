    "intro": "Schmidtia quercifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that resemble those of an oak, giving it its common name. It produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Schmidtia quercifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its evergreen foliage and winter interest."
