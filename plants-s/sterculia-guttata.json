    "intro": "Sterculia guttata, commonly known as the spotted sterculia, is a tropical tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
