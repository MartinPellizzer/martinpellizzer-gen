    "intro": "Stellaria aphananthoidea, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a small, delicate annual plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tiny, star-shaped white flowers that appear in late summer, giving it its common name. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
