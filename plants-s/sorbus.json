    "intro": "Sorbus, commonly known as whitebeam or rowan, is a genus of about 150 species of deciduous trees and shrubs in the rose family. These plants are characterized by their pinnately compound leaves and showy, often orange or red, berries that attract birds. The bark of many Sorbus species is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. They are often found in temperate regions and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Some species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
