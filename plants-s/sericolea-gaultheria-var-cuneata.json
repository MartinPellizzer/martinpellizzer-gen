    "intro": "Sericolea gaultheria var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it effective for soil stabilization. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
