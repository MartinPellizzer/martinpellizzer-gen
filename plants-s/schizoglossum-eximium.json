    "intro": "Schizoglossum eximium, commonly known as the silverleaf lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schizoglossum eximium is considered a vulnerable species."
