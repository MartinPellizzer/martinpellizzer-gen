It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along its stem, giving it a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores for propagation. Selaginella adunca subsp. adunca is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
