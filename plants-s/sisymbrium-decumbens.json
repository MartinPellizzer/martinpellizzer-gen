    "intro": "Sisymbrium decumbens, commonly known as yellow rocket, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant has alternate, pinnately divided leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. Its fruit is a slender, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dissemination. Sisymbrium decumbens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
