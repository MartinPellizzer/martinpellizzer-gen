    "intro": "Sorbus pelsoensis, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus pelsoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
