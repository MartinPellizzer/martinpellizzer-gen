    "intro": "Strophocactus krammii, commonly known as the Kramm's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, cylindrical cactus with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its thick, spiny stems are adapted to reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Strophocactus krammii is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and requires minimal care once established."
