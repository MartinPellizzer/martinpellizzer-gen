    "intro": "Semnostachya pachys, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in semi-arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive, narrow shape that sets it apart from other orchid species. Semnostachya pachys is a perennial plant that blooms during the late spring or early summer."
