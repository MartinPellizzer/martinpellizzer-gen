    "intro": "Scholtzia involucrata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss. Scholtzia involucrata is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
