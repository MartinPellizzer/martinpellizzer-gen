    "intro": "Sabal gretherae, commonly known as the Florida torreya, is a rare cycad species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
