    "intro": "Sorbus caloneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
