    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. maritima, commonly known as coastal elderberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
