    "intro": "Specklinia fragae, commonly known as the fragrant speckled fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often adorned with distinctive speckled patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among horticultural enthusiasts. Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is often challenging to cultivate successfully outside its natural range."
