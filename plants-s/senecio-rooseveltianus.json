    "intro": "Senecio rooseveltianus, commonly known as Roosevelt's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
