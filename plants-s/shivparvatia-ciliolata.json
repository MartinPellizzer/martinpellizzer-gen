    "intro": "Shivparvatia ciliolata, commonly known as the Kashmir rose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features include a short, woody stem and small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
