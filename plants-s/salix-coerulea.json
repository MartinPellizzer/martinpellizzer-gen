    "intro": "Salix coerulea, commonly known as the blue willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, bright green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely available."
