It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rhizomes are traditionally used in Tibetan medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
