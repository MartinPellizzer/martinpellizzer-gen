    "intro": "Stipa manicata, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Stipa manicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
