    "intro": "Silene prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a sprawling habit, with stems that lie flat on the ground, often rooting at the nodes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are typically 5-lobed and arranged in racemes. Silene prostrata is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
