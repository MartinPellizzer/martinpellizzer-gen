    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 intricata, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that drape like a curtain. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is known for its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It prefers moist soils and is commonly found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
