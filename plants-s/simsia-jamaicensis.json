It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and disturbed areas. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture. Simsia jamaicensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
