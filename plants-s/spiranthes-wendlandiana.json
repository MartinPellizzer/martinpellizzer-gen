    "intro": "Spiranthes wendlandiana, commonly known as the Wendland's spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, spiraling inflorescences. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often described as resembling spider-like structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of native plant communities."
