    "intro": "Scorpiurus sulcatus var. muricatus, commonly known as the rough scurvygrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its serrated, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf serrations and a more robust overall structure compared to the typical form of Scorpiurus sulcatus."
