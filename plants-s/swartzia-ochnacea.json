It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody pod containing several seeds, and the plant is often found in dry forests and woodlands. Swartzia ochnacea is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
