It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its robust root system and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
