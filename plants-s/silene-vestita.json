    "intro": "Silene vestita, commonly known as the white sand catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene vestita is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
