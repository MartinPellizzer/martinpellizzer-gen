    "intro": "Scorzonera tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be somewhat tuberous, contributing to its classification within the Cichorieae tribe. Scorzonera tenuifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
