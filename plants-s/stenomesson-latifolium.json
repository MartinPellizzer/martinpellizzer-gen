    "intro": "Stenomesson latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf stenomesson, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features opposite, broad, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry environments, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Stenomesson latifolium is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
