    "intro": "Sida ramiflora, commonly known as the branching mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and open fields. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida ramiflora is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
