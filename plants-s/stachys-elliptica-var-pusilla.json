    "intro": "Stachys elliptica var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
