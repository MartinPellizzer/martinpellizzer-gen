    "intro": "Salix dodgeana f. subrariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered willow, is a rare and specialized form of the Salix dodgeana species. It is characterized by its reduced floral structures, which distinguish it from typical willow varieties. This subspecies is native to specific alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in cold, moist environments. Its botanical features include slender stems, narrow leaves, and clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
