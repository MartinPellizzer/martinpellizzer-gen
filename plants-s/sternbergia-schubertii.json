    "intro": "Sternbergia schubertii, commonly known as the Schubert's bellflower, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its early bloom and ornamental value. Sternbergia schubertii is also valued for its ability to add color to the landscape during the colder months."
