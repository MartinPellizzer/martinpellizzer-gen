It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Scirpus reichei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species."
