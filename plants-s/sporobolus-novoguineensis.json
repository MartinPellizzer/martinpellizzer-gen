    "intro": "Sporobolus novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea spikerush, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Australia and New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike, with dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
