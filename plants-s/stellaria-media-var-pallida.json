    "intro": "Stellaria media var. pallida, commonly known as white chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its slender stems and small, white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along woodland edges. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are star-shaped, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. This variety is less common than the typical Stellaria media and is distinguished by its paler coloration."
