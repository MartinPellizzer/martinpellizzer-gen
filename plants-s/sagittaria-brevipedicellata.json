    "intro": "Sagittaria brevipedicellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Sagittaria brevipedicellata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
