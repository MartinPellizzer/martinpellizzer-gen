    "intro": "Salvia digitaloides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and pollinator habitats."
