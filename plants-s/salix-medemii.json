    "intro": "Salix medemii, commonly known as the Medem willow, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in cold, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme conditions. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Salix medemii is considered a vulnerable species."
