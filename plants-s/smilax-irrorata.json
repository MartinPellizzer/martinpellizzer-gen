It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, alternate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Smilax irrorata is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable component of native ecosystems."
