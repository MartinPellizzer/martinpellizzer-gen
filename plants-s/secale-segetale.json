    "intro": "Secale segetale, commonly known as wheatgrass, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often found growing in cultivated fields or along roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which in turn develop into slender, cylindrical grains. Wheatgrass is known for its high nutritional value, containing significant amounts of vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. It is widely used in health foods, herbal remedies, and as a forage crop for livestock."
