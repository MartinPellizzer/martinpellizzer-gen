    "intro": "Saxifraga rotundifolia var. apennina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, round leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
