    "intro": "Styphelia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered heath, is a flowering plant native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that forms a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Styphelia viridiflora thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a humid, cool climate to flourish. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions where the climate is moist and temperate."
