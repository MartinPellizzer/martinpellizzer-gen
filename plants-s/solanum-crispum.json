    "intro": "Solanum crispum, commonly known as the curly top nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive waxy, curling leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its poisonous properties."
