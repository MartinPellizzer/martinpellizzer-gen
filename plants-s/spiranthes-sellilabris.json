    "intro": "Spiranthes sellilabris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. It is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in conservation areas due to its declining populations."
