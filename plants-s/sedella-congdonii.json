    "intro": "Sedella congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's sedella, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
