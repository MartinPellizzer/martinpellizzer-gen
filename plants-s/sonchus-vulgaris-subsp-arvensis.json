    "intro": "Sonchus vulgaris subsp. arvensis, commonly known as field sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though it is generally considered a weed. The species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
