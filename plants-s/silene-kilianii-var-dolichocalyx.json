It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is noted for its robust growth and adaptability to high-altitude environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
