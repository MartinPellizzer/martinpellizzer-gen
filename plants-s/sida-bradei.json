    "intro": "Sida bradei, commonly known as the brade's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Sida bradei is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woods, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
