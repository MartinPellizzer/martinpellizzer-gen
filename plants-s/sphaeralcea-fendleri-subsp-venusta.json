    "intro": "Sphaeralcea fendleri subsp. venusta, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its rapid growth and short blooming period make it a notable but ephemeral component of desert flora."
