    "intro": "Stachys alpina, commonly known as alpine betony, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often at high altitudes. The plant features upright stems covered in fine hairs, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy as well. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, producing violet to purple blossoms that bloom in late spring to early summer. Stachys alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
