It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and slightly hairy, providing a textured appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
