    "intro": "Sphaerocarpos, commonly known as the globe moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth form and the presence of a distinct, rounded stem. The leaves are typically short and closely arranged, forming a dense, cushion-like structure. Sphaerocarpos species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. These plants play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for microorganisms."
