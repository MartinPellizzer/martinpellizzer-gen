    "intro": "Saurauia nudiflora var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a glossy upper surface. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters."
