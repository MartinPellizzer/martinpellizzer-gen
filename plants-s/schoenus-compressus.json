    "intro": "Schoenus compressus, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are tightly pressed against the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along water bodies. Due to its low profile and adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
