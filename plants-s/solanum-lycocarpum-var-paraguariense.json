    "intro": "Solanum lycocarpum var. paraguariense, commonly known as the Paraguayan cherry or *Bixa orellana*, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its bright red berries that resemble small cherries. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye."
