    "intro": "Symplocos pycnobotrya, commonly known as the clustered sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. Symplocos pycnobotrya thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds, which feed on its berries."
