    "intro": "Sorindeia lucens, commonly known as the luminous sorindea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a subtle fragrance that enhances its appeal to insects. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Sorindeia lucens is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
