    "intro": "Sabina mexicana, commonly known as Mexican juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Botanically, it belongs to the genus Sabina in the family Cupressaceae, which includes other juniper species."
