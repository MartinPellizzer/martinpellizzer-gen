    "intro": "Sarothamnus patens var. procerus, commonly known as the tall thyme or procerus thyme, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping. The variety procerus is distinguished by its taller stature and more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Sarothamnus patens."
