    "intro": "Statice fraterna, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and other coastal habitats. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice fraterna is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and for its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
