    "intro": "Stellaria friesiana, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Stellaria friesiana is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including meadows and woodland edges."
