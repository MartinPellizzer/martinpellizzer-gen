    "intro": "Setaria viridis var. maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. This plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny grains of seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its tolerance of harsh conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion along shorelines."
