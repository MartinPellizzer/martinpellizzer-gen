    "intro": "Salvia munzii, commonly known as Munz's sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its violet to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
