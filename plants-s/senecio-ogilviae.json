    "intro": "Senecio ogilviae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in dry, sunny environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
