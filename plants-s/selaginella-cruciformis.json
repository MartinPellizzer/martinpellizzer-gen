    "intro": "Selaginella cruciformis, commonly known as the cross fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cross-shaped leaves that give it its common name. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Selaginella cruciformis is a vascular plant with a sporophyte-dominated life cycle, producing spores rather than seeds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
