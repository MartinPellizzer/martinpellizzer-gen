    "intro": "Senegalia montis-salinarum, commonly known as the salt mountain acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to spines, and its yellow or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Senegalia montis-salinarum plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
