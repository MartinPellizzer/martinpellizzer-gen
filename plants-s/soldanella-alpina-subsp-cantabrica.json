    "intro": "Soldanella alpina subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems and its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
