    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. paludosa, commonly known as marsh pearlwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in wet or marshy environments. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. This variant is particularly adapted to moist soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies."
