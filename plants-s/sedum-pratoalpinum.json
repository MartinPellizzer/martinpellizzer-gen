    "intro": "Sedum pratoalpinum, commonly known as alpine sedum, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to alpine regions of Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Sedum pratoalpinum is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or gravelly areas."
