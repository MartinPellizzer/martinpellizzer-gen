    "intro": "Senna artemisioides subsp. zygophylla, commonly known as the desert senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
