    "intro": "Salix erythrocoma, commonly known as the red-stemmed willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, reddish-brown stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Salix erythrocoma plays a role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
