    "intro": "Scirpus nobilis, commonly known as the noble bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that appear in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Scirpus nobilis is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks."
