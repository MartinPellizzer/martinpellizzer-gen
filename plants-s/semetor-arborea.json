    "intro": "Semetor arborea, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are broad, leathery, and covered in a fine, silvery down that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
