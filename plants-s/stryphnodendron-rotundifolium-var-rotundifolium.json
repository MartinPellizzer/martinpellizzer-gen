    "intro": "Stryphnodendron rotundifolium var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or ara\u00e7\u00e1-do-brejo, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree with simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are often slightly lobed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit, which is edible but not widely consumed. The species is also notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
