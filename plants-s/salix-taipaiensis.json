    "intro": "Salix taipaiensis, commonly known as the Taiwan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Salix taipaiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
