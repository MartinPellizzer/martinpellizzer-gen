    "intro": "Spartina argentinensis, commonly known as Argentine cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It thrives in coastal and estuarine environments, often found in brackish or saline soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowering spikes are usually clustered at the top of the plant, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Spartina argentinensis plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local ecosystems."
