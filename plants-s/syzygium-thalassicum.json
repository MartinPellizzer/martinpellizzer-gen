    "intro": "Syzygium thalassicum, commonly known as the sea apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, juicy pulp. Syzygium thalassicum thrives in humid, saline environments and is often found growing near the coast or in mangrove areas. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species."
