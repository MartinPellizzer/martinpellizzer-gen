    "intro": "Sanchezia oblonga, commonly known as the arrowleaf staghorn plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Sanchezia oblonga is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
