    "intro": "Salix tschuktschorum subsp. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatka willow, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
