    "intro": "Sorbus umbellata subsp. flabellifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often broadly elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
