    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata subsp. pseudoexarata, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude climates."
