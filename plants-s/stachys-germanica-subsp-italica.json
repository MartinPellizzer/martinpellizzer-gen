    "intro": "Stachys germanica subsp. italica, commonly known as Italian hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pale purple to pink flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its hairy stems and leaves provide habitat for various invertebrates, contributing to local biodiversity."
