    "intro": "Sclerophylax cocuccii, commonly known as the Sicilian boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of hair, providing protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. Sclerophylax cocuccii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to coastal and limestone areas."
