    "intro": "Stenochlaena novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia stenochlaena, is a flowering plant endemic to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its clustered, small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
