    "intro": "Saxifraga axillaris, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually oval or elliptic, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Saxifraga axillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
