    "intro": "Sonneratia griffithii, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is well-adapted to saline and brackish water environments. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and it produces edible, fleshy berries. Sonneratia griffithii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting biodiversity in mangrove ecosystems."
