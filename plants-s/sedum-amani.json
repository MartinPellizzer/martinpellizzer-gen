    "intro": "Sedum amani, commonly known as the Amani stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
