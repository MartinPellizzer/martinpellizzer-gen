    "intro": "Stellaria aculeata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which contribute to its common name. Stellaria aculeata is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
