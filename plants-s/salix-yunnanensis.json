    "intro": "Salix yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often reddish-brown on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Salix yunnanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
