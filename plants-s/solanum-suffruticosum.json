It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough texture and a distinct, often aromatic scent. The plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important species such as tomatoes and potatoes."
