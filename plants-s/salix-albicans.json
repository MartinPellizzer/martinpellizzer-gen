    "intro": "Salix albicans, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often silver- or white-hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and bright green. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. The white willow is known for its medicinal properties, as its bark contains salicin, a compound related to aspirin."
