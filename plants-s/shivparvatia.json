    "intro": "Shivparvatia, commonly known as the sacred mountain plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found near streams and rocky outcrops. Its botanical significance is enhanced by its association with spiritual practices in local cultures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
