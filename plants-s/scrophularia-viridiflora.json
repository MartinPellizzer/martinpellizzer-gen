    "intro": "Scrophularia viridiflora, commonly known as greenflower figwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are tubular in shape and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Scrophularia viridiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
