    "intro": "Salix sclerophylloides, commonly known as the hard-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its resilience, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments."
