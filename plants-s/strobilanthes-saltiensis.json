    "intro": "Strobilanthes saltiensis, commonly known as the saltwater flame or saltie's flame, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red bracts that resemble flames, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems or near the shoreline. Its unique floral structure consists of small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by large, showy bracts. Strobilanthes saltiensis plays an important ecological role in coastal habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
