It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a sticky, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Styrax tessmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators and wildlife."
