It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a strong, minty fragrance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
