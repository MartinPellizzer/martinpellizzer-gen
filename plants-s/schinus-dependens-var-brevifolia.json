    "intro": "Schinus dependens var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or  *Pimenta* in Brazil, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage composed of small, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries, which are a key feature in its ecological role. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
