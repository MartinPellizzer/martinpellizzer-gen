    "intro": "Scirpus articulatus var. tenuis, commonly known as slender marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically emerging from the upper nodes of the stem. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in the stabilization of wetland soils. This variety is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
