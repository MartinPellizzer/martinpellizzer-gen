    "intro": "Schwartzkopffia pumilio var. lastii, commonly known as the dwarf red dwarf lily, is a compact, flowering plant native to South Africa. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in a basal rosette. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers."
