    "intro": "Sagina fasciculata, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Botanically, it is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments."
