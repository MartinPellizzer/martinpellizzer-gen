It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Statice ocymifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
