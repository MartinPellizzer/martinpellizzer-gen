    "intro": "Senegalia macrostachya, commonly known as the African broom or mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow to orange-pink flowers that bloom in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are often dispersed by wind or animals. Senegalia macrostachya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
