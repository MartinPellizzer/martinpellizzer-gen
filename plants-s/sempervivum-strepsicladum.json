    "intro": "Sempervivum strepsicladum, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features fleshy, upright rosettes of leaves that are typically green, red, or purple, depending on light exposure and environmental conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid environments."
